3:39:31	Madfish2021	@lowratedhighlander yeah I feel you. I don’t have a personal opinion it’s just what I’m seeing a lot of
3:39:45	SupraUK_	@WookiePotamus great improvement on it btw, i saw the twitter impressions 🤝
3:39:50	LowRatedHighlander	@madfish2021 yeah I gotcha

3:40:20	dmidge	What's the news being discussed?
3:40:22	WookiePotamus	@gfymeowmix I used to do 10x20 for squats buts it's hard to keep that kind of motivation through the whole work out
3:40:24	Madfish2021	I don’t know if it’s bad or good to be fair. Maybe we will see down the line

3:40:53	splitzkie_	people on internet being hypocrites? im shocked
3:40:55	Madfish2021	Imagine buying Newcastle for less than faceit KEKW
3:41:03	GFYMeowMix	@WookiePotamus ya it's just so much volume. have you tried tempo? probably better for squats than DL, but going slow up and down and other variations.

3:42:46	GFYMeowMix	WookiePotamus another good one (i'm assuming you probably do though) is split squats (Bulgarians) , lunges, step ups

3:57:46	danielnumba1	the next major will be called IEM Valve major btw @fl0m
3:57:47	Anwraith	Valve realized the community is better at managing the comp scene. So they don't have to do anything, and they profit from it.
3:58:00	Mazvydas	guys, whenever products/services/companies like these change hands it's usually followed by hhyyuuUUUuuge press events/releases to talk about all the "awesome" shit they're about to do. we have literally silence. saudis just consolidating more western assets, thats literally it. don't expect consolidation, merging of services or anything else. status quo won't change ban me if it does in the next 24 months
