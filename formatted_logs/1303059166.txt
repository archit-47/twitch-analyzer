1:41:00	Yaleb4K	I think should do a full reset of the roster I know they can’t and the resigning of naf but I think they need new blood and maybe 1 person from old roster like naf or nitro

2:39:28	thelilifefe	I really don't feel confortable with scrolling
2:39:29	TheNarwhalNation	i use my mouse side button for jump, its nice
2:39:30	bI_IrNer	the D2 box jump where you don't show your head to cat can't be down with a space
2:39:30	seren1ty1337	scrollwheel does cause accidents though, like randomly jumping and missclicking it
2:39:35	vinciCS	chilipiez KEKW no
2:39:36	EINacho	scrollwheel is better for 128 tick bhopping and space bar for 64 tick

9:44:01	To_The_AsheS	Yeah so that's to be expected. With Dev1ce they want to give him space and creates a bit of pressure, without Dev1ce they can be a bit more "Selfish" in terms of taking space

9:45:03	alpinestartgate	@ScoutPack151 it's true. since es3tag joined, phzy has played more games on NIP than dev1ce has
9:45:08	we3bly	is he just having mental problems?
