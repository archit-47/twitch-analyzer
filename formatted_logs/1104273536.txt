0:17:56	The_Norister	small studio of like 4-6 devs I think
0:18:03	Rydakule	@w0rseN a small indie studio of 4 devs called 1047 studios
0:18:07	LowRatedHighlander	incarnate528 id argue basically none of them play together and if they did it was a handful of times and never as 5
0:18:13	HippoplatypusRex	4, but they upped it to 6 recently
0:18:29	mern_eh	holy shit that's more devs than CS
0:18:38	incarnate528	just a suggestion if they want to make a thing out of it

0:21:01	Rydakule	I'm playing it. It gets super hype in comp
0:21:02	saltybopss	I wanna try it but heard the servers have been getting hammered. is that not the case anymore?
0:21:11	BozzyRL	I loved Halo, but have no interest in getting this game. Just dont feel like I'd actually put time in to it. Super entertaining to watch though
0:21:17	drivel___	Everyone should play it but also no one should cause I want to get on servers fast
0:21:24	Rydakule	@saltybopss It's still the case
0:21:38	mern_eh	in the splitgate discord server it says 80 minutes wait

0:32:51	LowRatedHighlander	BooomerNinja oh fuck yeah Peeposit
0:32:56	SeanShank87	@mern_eh here's the thing though, if they didn't have crossplay a lot of games would die due to lack of popularity having it on open platforms means more active game sometimes.
0:33:07	BooomerNinja	Peeposit

0:33:28	SeanShank87	I like crossplay a lot, i thing every game that isn't exclusive should universally be crossplay
0:33:33	LowRatedHighlander	crossplay is literally what my wildest dreams were as a kid
0:33:43	Rydakule	There was a PC control player in the last splitgat tourney. He did well too

0:35:20	Uwotm08	Sony put the kabosh on crossplay for the longest time, they only recently started allowing it, probably under pressure from Epic Games.

0:46:33	mern_eh	KEKPOINT posting the same link over and over
0:46:46	Uwotm08	I reposted one link, the other is mousesensitivity.com but apparently it's a for-pay site.
0:46:55	w0rseN	i dont like that the healthbar and ammo are up top
0:46:55	Relentless1113	literally just Google a sens converter people PEEPOWEIRD
0:46:58	LowRatedHighlander	oh fuck paying for that shit KEKW
0:46:59	Uwotm08	https://aiming.pro/mouse-sensitivity-calculator was the other one.
0:47:02	Un111KnoWn	@Uwotm08 the paid link is useless now that there is aimingpro
0:47:05	GloryD	YEP PEEPOWEIRD
0:47:06	LowRatedHighlander	theres literally free websites for that
0:47:08	ShallowSloth	the browns extended nick chubb
0:47:10	ShallowSloth	nice :)
0:47:11	mel0n_FPS	@Uwotm08 This site works without needing to pay, best to convert from Source/Quake
0:47:13	LowRatedHighlander	KEKW
0:47:17	LowRatedHighlander	BOP
0:47:21	mern_eh	who the fuck would pay for a sens converter there's so many free ones
0:47:25	Un111KnoWn	@LowRatedHighlander back then there was only the paid website but now it's useless because there are free ones
0:47:37	Un111KnoWn	@mern_eh i think back then there was only the paid one but now there are free competitiors
0:47:42	Neiruhh	POGGERS
0:47:48	LowRatedHighlander	Un111KnoWn yeah thats what i mean. like theres no point in paying
0:47:49	scythe_salazar	there are more sites that don't have splitgate as an option lol
0:47:52	LowRatedHighlander	now at least
0:47:53	LeXCS	I was like “I’ll just wait ten minutes and turn my stream back on when I can finally log in to splitgate.”
0:48:00	LeXCS	Still not logged in BabyRage
0:48:06	LowRatedHighlander	LeXCS KEKW
0:48:12	BooomerNinja	KEKPOINT Lex
0:48:13	LowRatedHighlander	yeah apparently its like 80 min queue
0:48:13	Nomad182	@LeXCS same Rainge
0:48:18	Un111KnoWn	@scythe_salazar aimingpro has splkitgate. also the aim trainer aimlab on steam has sensitivity conversions
0:48:18	din56413	the game is full with bots
0:48:22	Uwotm08	@LeXCS lexcsFeels
0:48:23	mern_eh	LeXCS I've not been able to get in once
0:48:23	LowRatedHighlander	meanwhile fl0m over here has like the hook up or some shit
0:48:23	mel0n_FPS	Also a lot of the sites have the wrong sens scale for splitgate, as far as I know mouse sensitivity is the only site that has the right one
0:48:31	Relentless1113	how much does the beta for this cost chat?
0:48:33	Un111KnoWn	@din56413 actual ai bots or bad palyers?
0:48:37	w0rseN	LUL
0:48:39	nateburkman	im toxic. ban me

0:48:57	zoofuu_	EZ
0:49:19	Uwotm08	@LeXCS apparently fl0m got the hookup from the company CEO for priority queue access.
0:49:29	Un111KnoWn	do you start with ur op guns or do you have to pick up guns from the ground?
0:49:31	seasidesandies	This games sick
0:49:33	Technical__13	I’ve been playing this shit for like 8 hours
0:49:53	LeXCS	Love you for that, I could hit them up. I’m full commit at this point though
0:49:58	Uwotm08	Anyway it was 01:30 here and I was going to sleep.
0:50:03	danielsav669	is there still a wait time
0:50:19	Relentless1113	honestly, finding sens in any game is pretty simple. Increase or decrease until you feel comfy. There's no "perfect" sens
0:50:35	SeanShank87	this game is getting a lot of attention now so I don't blame them for having a que
0:50:35	kcalbyclown	good morning flum and chat
0:50:37	mel0n_FPS	6 man dev team, CEO said they went from 200 to 150k players in under two weeks lol
0:50:43	zoofuu_	this is technically a beta?
0:50:48	mel0n_FPS	and now we're at 300K
0:51:07	yobtih	Gunna be MIA this weekend. Anniversary is tomorrow have a good one
0:51:11	Relentless1113	oof, server issues are always rough. ATT(vr rpg) ilhad the same issues when they launched both on pc and quest
0:51:26	mel0n_FPS	They're trying to scale up servers as quick as they can but they can't keep up lol
0:51:28	Nomad182	@yobtih yo enjoy rooHi
0:51:34	LeXCS	That’s my biggest issue with splitgate. Sound is awful and it’s really hard to know where you’re being hit from
0:51:40	iVex	when PC players actually have people to play against, shit booms
0:51:42	Rydakule	@zoofuu_ It was actually supposed to be full release by this point, but they got donated 10 mil and decided to extend the beta and use the money to expand the team and increse server capacity

0:51:49	shain_12345	this game seems fun
0:51:51	LeXCS	They fix that I accidentally stream the game for 20 hours straight without rage
0:52:15	seasidesandies	Do you think Halo Infinite will have much of a negative impact on this? I sure as hell hope the PlayStation community keeps supporting it at least its awesome
0:52:25	Nomad182	I found that I was constantly using my minimap to go get fights
