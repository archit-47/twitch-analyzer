So if you see a crocodilian in saltwater, you can bet it's not an alligator.

0:42:13	dankiyy	still a fucking unicorn run LUL
0:42:14	n0r13k	@007deman I want him to change a lot because I feel like he's technically extremely good, he had the potential to be the best AWPer to come out NA - but his attitude is garbo.
0:42:18	DSGStrider	i almost went to boston, then said nah NA won't win they never win, have regretted it ever since
0:42:19	curpyx	boston major was the most entertaining
0:42:20	yobtih	they weren't fun for anyone
0:42:22	yobtih	Astralis just won
0:42:26	STatisfacti0n	^
0:42:29	LucidR9	astralis has fans hitboy
0:42:30	BizarreMark	^
0:42:30	iiKobe	lynn vision was a lot better than I expected
0:42:32	2020numbers	peepoSit what are we doing for 20 before the next match?

0:42:41	luckinout1	What would be the best final matchup in terms of viewership? Navi / Liquid?
0:42:44	flyguy1449	I live in boston I wish i was into csgo back then
0:42:44	sleeeeppyyyy	astralis winning = greatest thing OOOO
0:42:49	curpyx	starladder was just halo here is astralis and every other team that just gets rolled by them
0:42:49	n0r13k	@007deman if you ever have a bit of time, DAVEY talked about him on Splyce - was a good listen.
0:42:49	STatisfacti0n	of course it was the unicorn run. C9 fucking REVERSE SWEPT groups to win a FUCKING MAJOR
0:42:50	LucidR9	haha - not what i Meant fl0m
0:42:50	batsbanaan_	astralis fans WeirdEyes
0:42:52	TacticalAlmonds	What was good about the london major? Astralis just ran through it, tons of tech issues, almost no close games. It was cool to see the storyline of Astralis, but there was nothing outside of that
0:42:53	agarlicbear	i mean the whole ence run was a great storyline no
0:42:54	CORN3e	astralis at least teached everyone to use utility
0:42:56	sleeeeppyyyy	batsbanaan_ WeirdEyes

0:43:06	curpyx	nikos tilted KEKW
0:43:08	BizarreMark	but now OG vs Pain MmmHmm
0:43:09	n0r13k	Astralis changed the meta for the worse, if you ask me.
0:43:11	valentin_vasilev	@fl0m bro one question i played cod previously players didnt retire after they won a ring in csgo y they retire after winning major
0:43:12	dflated	Most boring major has to be the Faceit major 2018. It was so boring. Finals was so linear and you kinda knew how it all would pan out.
0:43:14	LucidR9	london major had more games that went to OT than games that didnt

1:22:07	Nightbot	i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree

1:33:11	Gearslayer360	The name Scandinavia would then mean "dangerous island", which is considered to be a reference to the treacherous sandbanks surrounding Scania. Skanör in Scania, with its long Falsterbo reef, has the same stem (skan) combined with -ör, which means "sandbanks". @fl0m

2:41:48	KEK_doubleU	twitch is my main soyrce of entertainment and gossip
2:41:49	BeepBoopMoopJoop	@agarlicbear the point of the leak? lots of people have an interest in the backend of apps, especially huge apps like twitch, think of what competitors can do with it
2:41:53	yobtih	it's reality TV with a parasocial relationship
2:41:57	pedeso	livestream fails puts that on full display

2:43:12	jebby__	people dont know what the particulars are on sub payouts. dont some streamers get a higher share of the subs revenue?
2:43:13	KEK_doubleU	Twitch is also very transparent on its viewership numbers, which traditional tv lacks
