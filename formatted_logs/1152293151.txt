3:19:32	torp3d0_	@ZeeK678 but a few years back I remember razer being in a veryyyyy shitty spot in terms of mouse at least, I read that people had double click and etc with just 2/3 months of usage
3:19:34	njgyaani	i dont think astralis would even qualify to play off at major
3:19:37	Uwotm08	@apodis10 The scrollwheel of my G Pro (non-wireless) lasted a good five years before it gave up.
3:19:40	ZeeK678	was gonna just use the cord but was too short
3:19:41	SwifferWetWiener	@ZeeK678 i just wish it didnt have side buttons, itd be perfect for my size

4:16:52	AndreMacassi	Grim is great at ecos.
4:17:00	margiela69	I feel like you need to do at least 1 full save on CT there
4:17:10	margiela69	This meta where you always at least force scouts and pistols isn't good on d2

4:19:32	speciality_	Ancient is going to get a huge update, maybe more teams will go for it
4:19:36	ANinjaCake	mythic #1 ancient team
4:19:40	Kraken_Lord	@gilbilly_ for what roles Grim plays, he's fantastic. He just had one bad map
4:19:40	w0rmk1ll3r	not necessarily. ancient simply replaced liquid's perma ban so its like saying liquid would need to learn train
4:19:43	LowRatedHighlander	inferno against astralis?
4:19:48	LowRatedHighlander	like yeah
4:20:02	margiela69	I'm not saying they need to pick Ancient but if they don't perma ban it allows more flexibility in the pool
4:20:05	sealer9	you're not winning any map veto with 3rd map at this level man
4:20:08	ysfmhd	hey guys!! hope everyones good
4:20:19	elcheer	they don't perma ban it

4:20:24	LowRatedHighlander	yeah they floated it a couple times this group
4:20:26	LowRatedHighlander	alone

4:20:44	LowRatedHighlander	or any other recent matches
4:20:50	LowRatedHighlander	where grim was actually killing it
4:20:52	bolottekid	why mythic ban inferno fl0m ? Kappa
4:20:55	gilbilly_	I don’t think Grims has been performing good lately, he’s not in sync with the rest of the team and maybe not be up to their level.
4:20:56	datkidaa	how does the showdown work?
4:20:58	ysfmhd	cant wait to see EG make it outta showdown kek
4:21:00	LowRatedHighlander	against gambit/heroic/ and others
4:21:05	KraKy_3	Ancient needs an update. Probably wont happen until after the major though

4:21:27	elcheer	reading chat when liquid loses you can tell who actually watches or not KEKW
4:21:28	ysfmhd	@datkidaa only two teams make it out i believe, its gonna be contended between all teams eliminated from group stage
4:21:31	LowRatedHighlander	grim is part of why their inferno was so good recently
4:21:42	LowRatedHighlander	because he was locking down a site all on his own half the time
4:21:46	KingoftheCrease	Liquid lost this match because of fallen. I saw him miss at least one shot and imo he should be executed Kapp
4:21:46	nicholasguhrr	Who won the bo3 char?

4:22:00	nicholasguhrr	Sadge
4:22:01	winningblade_og_	they have the best lineup in the world no shit

4:24:37	margiela69	Astralis is the type of team that will beat Vitality just because the community is underrating them again

4:26:21	aain02	AoE 3?
4:26:39	bolottekid	SupraUK_ D:
4:26:42	SupraUK_	AoE III was a little lackluster tbh
4:26:43	frogoree	because AOE2 is a lot more popular than 3
4:26:45	hobrev	because AoE2 is the one everyone plays
4:26:49	frogoree	even though i like 3 a lot more
4:26:50	LowRatedHighlander	because 3 was the peek of age of empires back then
4:26:51	SupraUK_	AoE 2 > 3
4:26:52	ant_csgo	I think vitality loses this, I'm positive Astralis sat there all night and watched the demo's and are going to fix their mistakes
4:26:54	hobrev	and AoE3 was very forgettable :D

5:41:23	buttermayo	cheating kinda cringe
5:41:23	el_chapo_jr13	after intermission when u guys were playing on vert against i forgot who he came into the dreamhack chat lol
5:41:24	Lawsn_	guess its a similar concept to steroids in lifting and bodybuilding
5:41:27	djsturphry	#g3tgudscrub
5:41:33	cryptoc1	cheating in a * beta *
5:41:40	Bebis_Whale	Paying for cheats is like paying for a porn site like bro there's tons of other free content/cheats instead KEKW
5:41:41	DaE_dAe11	there's subs in chat right now who are on the gear
5:41:43	SvetoMD	some people make their living out of it, have you watched the sparklez interview with the faceit cheater?
5:41:48	ItsJustHenry	very good comparison tbf
5:41:51	LuckyGun	@therealkopojken fl0mSmort ty
5:41:56	DaE_dAe11	questionable
5:41:59	derpttube	ahhhh let's just not have that convo again it's complicated
5:42:04	RoosterToaster	naah it's not
5:42:12	ItsJustHenry	but then again in bodybuilding everyone does it so its like a full hvh lobby?
5:42:13	TheSolaceXD	rush b Pog
5:42:13	Scibber	@fl0m who is the better aimer shox or scream. cause they are both gods
5:42:13	Lawsn_	You cheat someone out of the trophy in both scenarios?
5:42:14	DaE_dAe11	exactly
5:42:14	n_lind	true
5:42:17	naMas000	its like paying someone to F$^# yo girl .....
5:42:23	Miksu2222	every single pro bodybuilder is on roids
5:42:27	DaE_dAe11	I cry and scream when i'm lobbied with a haxor
5:42:28	lonkor1	is nuke t sided now or what?
5:42:29	Scibber	@naMas000 people do that tho lol
5:42:35	winsong	lets be honest if you are ifbb then you most male physique you most likely are on some ped
5:42:53	xMacbro	the vanguard beta is just so underwhelming
5:42:59	naMas000	@Scibber im sure they do, but it aint for everyone :D
5:43:02	DaE_dAe11	everyones on the gear when it comes 2 bodybuilding
5:43:04	nilllow	cheating is just making everyone else have a bad time while they get off to it
5:43:09	static782	what do you say when cheaters say its just a game why do you take it so seriously
5:43:14	xremmyxcsgo	i would say a corked bat or using a hockey stick that is too long is a good comparison
5:43:15	DaE_dAe11	they're obviously on the gear.
5:43:15	JaYaJ	bodybuilders really took that pump it up song to the max
5:43:20	areyoukiddingmedude	a lot of olympic sports, the very top few are usually on ped's
5:43:21	zefixlikescsgo	what up chat
5:43:22	DaE_dAe11	exactly
5:43:22	ItsJustHenry	Its so dangerous that they alow these bodybuilders to say they're natty.. fucks up kids so bad
5:43:24	n_lind	bodybuilding is basically HvH
5:43:34	nyvoc_tv	pump pump it up catJam pump the jam

5:43:59	DOU8LE	@fl0m you think volvo will ever ban any of the big CS cheating youtubers? some have over 100k subs now. its pretty sad
5:44:00	apodis10	comparing steroids to cheating in a game is somewhat wonky, but i think one can make the argument that, since we're all constantly being compared to each other and looks do play a role in how we are being perceived, sterois could be considered unfair and thus cheating
5:44:04	dimesntreys	people expecting a new cod to absolutely wow them is like people thinking source 2 csgo is going to be a fundamental change

5:45:10	JaYaJ	chat what is the best hero in bloons?
5:45:10	r4gy	i think cheating and smurfing are rrather oon the same level, tbh
5:45:20	DaE_dAe11	those videos are funny af
5:45:23	SukksGaming	@njgyaani I got called cheater a lot. I think its a compliment. Im not even good
5:45:26	Aynle	“He’s in our spawn”
5:45:26	nilllow	only if the smurfs are really good lol
5:45:27	NibletTide	@r4gy yeah, both equally ruin games
5:45:28	LuckyGun	@JaYaJ the hacker monkey imo
5:45:29	Bebis_Whale	Uh nah cheating and smurfing are completely different
5:45:33	bosshogg911	not even CLOSE
5:45:38	DaE_dAe11	im se on my main and my smurf is s3
5:45:43	iretrasado	why are these Brazilians madding over grim
5:45:43	DaE_dAe11	so i smurf all the time
5:45:45	Thybo17	who you talking about? The cheater?
5:45:46	Messibeaucoup	I have to watch these videos
5:45:47	DaE_dAe11	big difference
5:45:54	ItsJustHenry	Cheating guarantees a win, smurfing only makes it easier for you to win (when you get queued with 4 apes)
5:45:56	SukksGaming	@DaE_dAe11 silver casting material?
5:45:57	Miksu2222	like R6S/val
5:46:00	Lawsn_	I'd also like to say that a unreasonably large percentage of people cant spot a good cheater for toffee and an equally large number of people don't like admitting there are cheaters
5:46:03	kab1as	Chat please tell me who we are talking about? I need my fix of drama
5:46:05	n_lind	same
5:46:10	njgyaani	sorry @fl0m but i feel like cheater and smurf r same
5:46:11	DaE_dAe11	@SukksGaming nah. i'm actually nutty af. i should be dmg
5:46:11	SquiDI0	same, i use a smurf just so i can play with friends
5:46:11	r4gy	hm okay, i see
5:46:12	ImTarco	Plus like... a smurf you can beat. A cheater... not so simple.
5:46:16	bk8990	smurfs on faceit can suck a fat one
5:46:17	Mountie888	not close but still feels bad. was a SEm when i get stuck vs DMGs it just feels bad, they so much better that they alomst look like they're cheating
5:46:20	DOU8LE	seriously though i've made tickets and reported people advertising cheats to volvo.. not one banned yet..
5:46:21	Mazvydas	i cheated when i was a kid, felt like a god in game, but later once a bit older realized how rewarding it is to improve to a level where ppl call me a cheater when I'm just playing my game
5:46:25	DaE_dAe11	my main was sem
5:46:27	apodis10	i wouldn't equate the two, but i do think that someone intentionally smurfing to shit on other people comes from the same point of motivation cheating does
5:46:29	njgyaani	yes but u can always play unranked if u wanna play with freinds
5:46:33	naMas000	no, when i smurf im drunk AF so its 50/50 then :)
5:46:37	Shotgun_Chef	They force smurfing
5:46:41	DaE_dAe11	deranked, now its se and my smurf is s2-s3
5:46:44	hapaulino	Zywoo 4:3 KEKW
5:46:44	synth3t1k1337	unrated exists, id rather play against a noob cheater than a smurf
5:46:48	priiide_	njgyaani unranked is a fucking joke
5:46:49	hobrev	so do things like OW, in higher elo the que times are so fucking long it takes ages to get a game
5:46:52	Messibeaucoup	people just get board from time to time… so they want to just poop on some people
5:46:54	Gearslayer360	they definitely do with restricting letting people play with someone outside of a certain range in addition to the queue times are nuts at the highest levels @fl0m
5:47:00	Rinm	if the availibility is there then....
5:47:02	Aynle	It’s rarely that simple with smurfs
5:47:03	Uwotm08	Valve actively discourages smurfing by massively tanking your Trust Factor if you play on more than one account.
5:47:07	zefixlikescsgo	blind KEK2
5:47:09	Shotgun_Chef	Smol not thiccc PP
5:47:09	Goldbludgeon	small DICKS anyone?
5:47:12	DaE_dAe11	sh0x is a g0d
5:47:13	r4gy	so it feels bad eithrr way for the recieving peeps, but it aint the same on a moral level
5:47:17	njgyaani	if u wanna play freinds then why not play unrank right?
5:47:20	small_tymer	that is what unranked play is for though
5:47:21	smaze521	i got small pee pee please dont rationalize.
5:47:32	TLsmf	how have pistols been so fucking OP for so long @fl0m
5:47:33	naMas000	i do that :D but i drink too when i smurf with my silvers
5:47:46	priiide_	valorant unranked is an absolute joke where people FF when you win 5 rounds
5:48:00	CannedTurkeyGames	unranked is ResidentSleeper
5:48:03	turtleflippers	so many people abandon unranked
5:48:04	nilllow	@priiide_ yeah its hilarious when that happens. kinda sad
5:48:07	Gearslayer360	ranked play is more serious and more likely to be played the way the game is supposed to be played @fl0m
5:48:11	Aynle	Unranked is literally a warmup
5:48:11	DOU8LE	ya unranked valo and overwatch are cancerous garbage
5:48:11	xremmyxcsgo	people always abandon in unranked
5:48:13	ChosenDew	valorant unranked is actually a joke. ppl just run around with knives
5:48:15	Uwotm08	Yeah I agree, unranked just seems as pointless as MM must be to FPL-C players.
5:48:21	ANinjaCake	@fl0m it still sucks getting dumpstered when you're just trying to play at your rank
5:48:33	naMas000	i just did unranked 20 min ago its was fun
5:48:42	Aynle	Apex unranked is a hell hole
5:48:47	el_chapo_jr13	daddy fl0ms brain is so massive. So good at rationalizing and breaking things down for small brains like me
5:48:50	SorrowInRain	unranked valo somehow is more toxic than ranked
5:48:52	earthbert	i never finished a unranked game with 10 player
5:49:00	Uwotm08	Smurfs are not Overwatch bannable for a reason.

5:49:42	xMacbro	on the topic of rank and elo: do yall think sbmm belongs in a casual multiplayer experience like cod?
5:49:45	ItsJustHenry	but the real question is WHY CAN WE STILL SEE SKINS IN OVERWATCH
5:49:45	Uwotm08	@earthbert For a while my TF was low because I quit *ONE* comp MM game when the other team had a cheater. I had quitters in literally every ranked MM game for a month. It was terrible.
5:49:46	hobrev	I really really miss public servers as the main platform to play casually

5:49:48	BrightWrld	what about level 10s that que with level 3s
5:49:50	Aynle	I feel that most smurfs want to play with their friends, the problem is when they drop 40 kills against silvers and need to throw to maintain their rank
5:49:53	Sun__House	mIRC <3 #findscrim lets gooooo

5:52:33	TLsmf	us na fans : liquid lost to the best team in the group
5:52:36	hobrev	also smurfing has been a thing in cs for ages and ages, Natu got banned on ClanBase of all things for essentially smurfing :D
5:52:49	proplep	how the fuck

5:52:55	small_tymer	great trigger discipline
5:52:55	danielvaltameri	COPIUM
5:52:56	TheSolaceXD	how
5:53:00	need_a_name__	zywoo missed 3 easy shots this map
5:53:06	el_chapo_jr13	clutch master
5:53:07	Shotgun_Chef	Valorant it seems like every round is an execute with a really rare hold to stop a plant. Then it is just retake simulator @fl0m
5:53:13	Nightbot	Latest video: What the Voice Comms during a DreamHack CS:GO Tournament Sounds Like! - https://youtu.be/OSlVtFo9bcw
5:53:17	el_chapo_jr13	nvm
5:53:19	xremmyxcsgo	liquid missed out on playing on lan ?
5:53:23	djsturphry	do you think they should add another way to A site on vertigo?
5:53:25	XDvineet	choke starts now maybe
5:53:47	TLsmf	yeah but still hurts man i need more copium
5:53:48	hastyrecon_tv	imagine being a liquid fan KEKW
5:53:52	beta_kush	Kyojin looks like an emo Harry Potter
5:53:57	Shotgun_Chef	@fl0m I think it is so boring to watch
5:53:59	hastyrecon_tv	oh wait thats me KEKL
5:54:05	xremmyxcsgo	sadgfe
5:54:07	ANinjaCake	@fl0m the spawn system in that game is a mistake
5:54:07	CannedTurkeyGames	bomb should take longer to plant
5:54:12	earthbert	i am curious how much is gla1ve contributing in the games
5:54:23	Gearslayer360	riot is very good at shifting metas lol @fl0m
5:54:37	shankl_bd	HELOOOOOOOOOO MAN
5:54:41	xremmyxcsgo	rant away fl0m

5:54:50	vent_diver	and there is the zywoo peek as always LUL
5:54:50	ImTarco	No such thing as a "B spawn" or something like that.
5:54:53	Kaamoos	Magisk PogChamp
5:55:12	hobrev	"So you like defaulting in pugs in csgo? Come to Valorant, there defaults are the only way to play!"
5:55:24	ItsJustHenry	@fl0m what about being able to sell misbuys?
5:55:28	shankl_bd	WHERE  U FROM ??????
5:55:39	RoosterToaster	Can you explain what's the Valorant spawn issue?
5:55:42	need_a_name__	16 14?
5:55:44	RoosterToaster	I don't play it
5:55:50	valikyrr	rounds having random chance of "maybe this guy peeks me first because good rng spawn" is pretty flawed too imo
5:55:54	XDvineet	its like previous match vit vs ast going to happeb
5:55:58	bruhandon46	Shox be the only pro planting after round end
5:56:01	Mountie888	@shankl_bd so much yelling. He's from Columbus but lives in Vegas
5:56:18	macbookfps	speaking of smurf, i'm playing an s4 match on inferno against a person with 4k hours
5:56:22	bringback8chan	Get copistriked
5:56:24	JohnnyChance	@bruhandon46 also the only one saying hf in chat
5:56:36	LukeryD	%? 16-14 Vitality
5:56:36	Nightbot	Joris says 83%
5:56:46	Mountie888	@macbookfps time in game doesn't mean skill (points to self as example)
5:57:07	LukeryD	history repeating itself monkaW
5:57:12	valikyrr	@macbookfps 800 hours focused practice > 4k hours casual play
5:57:15	dolev801	like d2 long
5:57:19	Uwotm08	Just think how different a round can go depending on whether your AWPer spawned closest to long A on dust2 or not.
5:57:22	macbookfps	@Mountie888 this guy hit a 4k with a deagle on 2nd round and is currently 9-2
5:57:22	TLsmf	but doesn't that eliminate luck from the game ?
5:57:24	TheSolaceXD	that factor of "luck" makes cs so enjoyable to watch
5:57:26	xremmyxcsgo	ya d2 long is a good example
5:57:28	fedoralva	There's a spawn area that you're held in by invisible walls, which you can move in during buy time, and decide which wall you want to go through at the beginning of round (if you've never played
5:57:29	SukksGaming	%? im dumb
5:57:29	Nightbot	Joris says 33%
5:57:30	Shotgun_Chef	Every valorant round plays the exact same
5:57:31	smaze521	fuck, that deep shit. never thought about it like that. but then again never needed to..
5:57:34	xremmyxcsgo	or lets rush b because of the spawn
5:57:34	SukksGaming	Thats over half Pog
5:57:35	RoosterToaster	Ahh... very interesting :)
5:57:39	JohnnyChance	they should just make those "walls" spawn in a range of spots
5:57:42	JohnnyChance	kinda a hybrid
5:57:44	ellricc	there's luck in every game, timings are luck
5:57:45	hobrev	also learning your timings is a huge part of getting good in cs
5:57:47	Scibber	Jojo's cat jumps last night @fl0m
5:57:48	Mardn	!youtube

5:57:49	Mountie888	@macbookfps ahh that feels bad
5:57:49	ImTarco	There's a skill in making the best of the RNG you're given.
5:57:56	TheRock_as	CS spawns are perfect ngl
5:57:59	XDvineet	i dont like character abilities from valorant but it makes it valorant !!
5:58:03	steth427	I know this can be a loaded question but, How has CSGO changed in the past 5 years?
5:58:06	Bebis_Whale	Do you think CS:GO is dying now that Valorant is gaining traction? @fl0m
5:58:09	MarinerofTheSea	I would say RNG dictates the posibilites but not the outcome
5:58:10	ItsAho	Is that a Dehumidifier ratched strapped to the wall behind magisk?
5:58:13	SAMURAI1011	players cant smoke ???
5:58:19	Gearslayer360	RNG with spawns seems ok at least the gun damage isnt RNG or like crits exist (except for headshots) @fl0m
5:58:20	n_lind	i dont think its rng in cs
5:58:20	smaze521	i guess it'll change with the meta.
5:58:22	a732v	luke-warm take: valorant has enough rng already
5:58:26	xremmyxcsgo	timing is game sense
5:58:31	xfrsky	Too much rng you get apex
5:58:33	ImTarco	BOP
5:58:33	Mountie888	@XDvineet same, just don't like the skills. weird gimmick for a skill shooter
5:58:34	juandizzymo	OOOOF
5:58:35	ItsJustHenry	vac
5:58:37	TLsmf	almost 2 molly kills
5:58:39	XeeVzz	cs spawns increase skill ceiling because you need to account for many scenarios and be aware
5:58:41	Uwotm08	Well said on timings being instinct.
5:58:42	zuccitycuccity	wow
5:58:44	STatisfacti0n	good thing his name is Lucky 5Head
5:58:46	Mrmuffin27	4Head get it?

6:07:58	ItsJustHenry	What % do winners get from the 40m?
6:07:59	dimesntreys	crowdfund mythic cup as an experiment

6:09:24	ItsJustHenry	Winners of TI10 get $18.2 million holy shit
6:09:24	Uwotm08	ReDeYe is very proud to claim credit for the idea of giving the vast majority of the prize pool to one winning team rather than having a more even distribution.
6:09:26	xMacbro	mythic cup major when?
6:09:26	JakestersLab	oh the international
6:09:27	shrimpboat27	hi m0lf luv you nice c*ck
6:09:35	kuzmoff	@fl0m did you watch the s1mple documentary?
6:09:37	LucidR9	who is m0lf
6:09:40	jackhale	The Compendium this year was incredibly dogshit and still made 160million
6:09:48	dimesntreys	you could also just have different tier tournaments like the champions league, europa league etc
6:09:54	hobrev	it makes the whole dota2 esports scene revolve around one tournament, effectively
6:09:55	Uwotm08	@fl0m I low key feel that Valve stopped doing the esports cases because they raised way too much money with it.
6:09:58	Jazprr	What about a select amount of team cases as well?
6:10:00	hobrev	its kinda really fucked
6:10:08	hobrev	there are 0 second tier tournaments

6:11:29	dimesntreys	isnt that navi in total
6:11:31	ItsJustHenry	does a teams sponsorship earnings massively outweigh their winnings (in Na'Vis case)?
6:11:47	Jazprr	How much do the players get out of the prize pool tho? Doesn't the ORG need cash too
6:11:53	necroix0	@siiiif worth rewatching the match?
6:11:55	golorene	%? 69
6:11:55	Nightbot	Joris says 8%
6:11:58	kuzmoff	@Jazprr depends on the org
