0:55:35	theBaboda	anything specific in terms of hiking and stuff like that I should know to avoid and should research before hand?
0:55:38	florusRL	@fl0m whats ur opinion on the client sidey-ness of cs smokes? I hate how inconsistent they are personally
0:55:40	mrziraxer	it went up for a sec few minutes ago but went down again
0:55:46	Doccy	as well as puffing billy
0:55:50	Doccy	good shit that

0:56:23	retoid	@fl0m I think turning off Low Latency mode fixed the issue, thank you.
0:56:25	DrtNinja	smokes are server side, but spectator view generates the smokes differently than the player sees them
0:56:33	proudgoose	@c0smosLIVE i was playing at lvl 9 and actually keeping up surprisingly well before current lose streak :( but ive heard that the higher elo has ALOT less of this, like its hard af to get to that elo but its easy to keep it because the games have somewhat better balance
0:56:45	proudgoose	at least thats what ive heard
0:56:48	DrtNinja	for that reason spectators sometimes see a bit more
0:56:50	florusRL	what about.... molly visibility? That is a tilter for me sometimes, altho i usually just avoid peeking them nowadays, but i feel like a molly shouldnt also be a psuedo smoke. ops? @fl0m
0:56:57	gapeher	they gotta be doin something this is way longer than normal for tuesday maintenance
0:56:59	mrziraxer	complex lineup
0:57:06	Chezpuf	@DrtNinja you got a source for that? would make a lot of sense...
0:57:07	mrziraxer	who remembers that KEKW
0:57:09	NateDyerCSGO	There is a much easier donut smoke from outside A tuns
0:57:12	jockst3r	that line up looks hard to remember but also good smoke
0:57:18	emmad	steam now is ok guys
0:57:19	Nightbot	now yes, steam is currently down for Tuesday maintenance. this means CS also no work
0:57:21	proudgoose	@florusRL whoever is further back can see through better, same with angle geometry u can use it to your advantage
0:57:23	NateDyerCSGO	I wish I had a way to show you
0:57:25	gapeher	good end game but that line up is wild lm ao
0:57:27	deuzex85	rofl these lineups, 10 sec setup
0:57:36	hunter6925	fl0m theres an easy lineup from that position for temple also
0:57:42	hunter6925	non jump throw
0:57:45	c0smosLIVE	@proudgoose yes thats it but the way up is VERY difficult in SOLOQ x)
0:57:47	emmad	stream not ddowm
0:58:00	NateDyerCSGO	@fl0m how can I show you a better donut smoke that does takes 1 sec to lineup
0:58:03	DCReaper_	@fl0m there is a way easier donut smoke outside the temple, lining up with the left hand rail and aiming at the top middle of the 2nd x from the bottom left
