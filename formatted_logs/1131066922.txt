2:59:45	harrrrsh	is this jdubs from fnatic? i heard he was pregnant
2:59:55	c0rkmcnortis	fl0m did you know that the muliple lane tactical maps with more than a 3 lane was introduced by val csgo branded that as anicent as a way to bring the bae of valorant players back to cs which is a game that is stale
2:59:57	errorcsAU	yep
3:00:03	macun1950	s1mple destroyed fnatic
3:00:04	mukulhayaran	fl0m did you know that the muliple lane tactical maps with more than a 3 lane was introduced by val csgo branded that as anicent as a way to bring the bae of valorant players back to cs which is a game that is stale

3:01:01	CharlyTevez	Mythic vs Navi on Vertigo, who wins? @fl0m
3:01:05	errorcsAU	yea mezi went nuts
3:01:09	M3n0H	but navi was supposed to lose fl0m, first game after player break
3:01:15	harrrrsh	c9 looking at mezii and alex frag out sadgeBusinessTime
3:01:17	sol1taire	Jackinho is fine. he's an average pro cs player. Not amazing. Not terrible. He's fine.
3:01:19	AIR02000	@CharlyTevez knowing Navi, Mythic, 2-1 map win
3:01:25	ChosenDew	mezii had 33 kills and 10 assists wild
3:01:28	c0rkmcnortis	peepoSit
3:01:33	b1lal97	true, apart from him, fnatic actually did make it competitive against navi. 22-19 and 16-13 is hella close.
3:01:34	tankwarhead	Fl0m I have recently reported YT to google due to their lack of recommendations of your videos on my recommended thank you
3:01:35	mukulhayaran	peepoSit

3:01:41	b1lal97	only their first series together
3:01:57	two_drop	@fl0m mythic might want to steal those flashes Alex had Fnatic throwing though -- they were devastating on overpass
3:02:07	ekstral0ve	jackinho's miss on the heaven player are the exact things that teaches a player to grow into the legends we know today
3:02:09	fl1pdof	Yeah alex had some sick videos
3:02:10	sol1taire	@errorcsAU im sure he will, and he will be fine. He will fullfil his awper role most of the time fine

6:12:36	Dewhz	Dating is to describe a stage in a person’s life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as “dating” which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved.
