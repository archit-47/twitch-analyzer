1:30:30	Nightbot	Fl0m is an ex-pro player who now streams full time. He is Rank S in ESEA and in FPL on FACEIT. His matchmaking rank is Global Elite (boosted by GTR). He is also Diamond something or other in VALORANT and Rank #1 in fucking dads and 139th in twitch earnings he’s mega homeless now. But no matter what, he will always be Rank #1 in our hearts smileW
