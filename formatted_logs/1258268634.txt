3:36:47	Nightbot	STatisfacti0n Cool! I thought I would meet like minded people to discuss NA CS in this chat. Guess you’ll just remain jackasses who want to promote their own propaganda instead of discussing pertinent issues. Cool, I’ll leave if these moderators are just dumb. Peace out.

3:36:51	Nightbot	Mod was quite unreasonable to talk about NA CS scene. Seems just like another 14 year old on twitch who just wants everyone to type KEKW everytime.... If these are the types of mods (and consequently goes higher up in food chain and extends to fl0m), give me permaban and I won't even bother watching this stream ever again.
