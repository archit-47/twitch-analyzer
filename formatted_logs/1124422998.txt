0:15:23	WRXorcist	@fl0m can you discuss how the #2 ranked NA RMR team (EXTREMUM) could be playing the major in 8 weeks without playing tier 1 match in 6 months.
0:15:36	draxler077	Finished organization EleGiggle
0:15:51	sloveCS	@WRXorcist cause as far as majors are concerned only RMR events matter nothing else does
0:16:19	WRXorcist	@slovecs I understand that, but it’s a bit of a farce don’t you think?
0:16:24	MrTwistyyy	ATK ON TOP
0:16:27	keetnawilson13	valve fucked up the RMR events but it's also somewhat understandable since a LAN NA RMR is impossible until late 2022 because of travel restrictions from BR
0:16:51	keetnawilson13	but they should've done 3 online instead of just giving up the 3rd event bc they couldn't do LAN
0:16:57	sloveCS	not really
0:16:57	WRXorcist	Like these guys are #2 in the region but can’t get invited to anything else @slovecs
0:17:21	sloveCS	they dont have the ranking cause they arent playing anything
0:17:38	hobrev	NiP also has had international rosters in other games in the past as well, NiP OW team was Finnish for example
0:17:46	HDFlood_	Heroic took the group by fucking storm
0:17:55	WRXorcist	So how do they improve ranking if they can’t play the events cos they don’t get invited?
0:17:57	HDFlood_	Don't do Heroic like that KEKW
0:18:04	keetnawilson13	@WRXorcist it's their choice not to play events
0:18:11	Killer_Panda2k11	I was waiting for the online discussion to come in KEKW
0:18:22	sloveCS	i dont know where they are in the world right now
0:18:23	SuperTuscan888	PauseFish
0:18:39	sloveCS	but they can play qualifiers, cash cups, etc
0:18:45	WRXorcist	@slovecs it’s bad atm, 35-40th I think
0:18:52	sloveCS	no i mean location wise
0:18:54	keetnawilson13	they're either in CIS and choosing not to play Tier 2 tournaments or in NA and just not doing anything
0:19:14	Killer_Panda2k11	Extremum is NA last time i checked
0:19:41	SuperTuscan888	Extremum is Oceania and Norway with an UE coach
0:19:49	WRXorcist	Oh, last I heard Kassad & 3 are in Russia & jkeam and AZR are in Norway i think @slovecs
0:19:52	SuperTuscan888	they were just a part of an NA org aka 100 Thieves
0:19:53	keetnawilson13	their twitter says they're in serbia I think?
0:20:00	sloveCS	i know where they are from i just dont know where they are at the moment

0:56:02	c0rkmcnortis	And he’s nucking futs at all of them @amutantcookie
0:56:04	Dynamo_Dave	I'm my opinion it's very hard to compete with players who've hit their skill ceiling and know how to play consistently
0:56:26	Nomad182	asuna smileW
0:56:37	amutantcookie	what did asuna play before cs? Was it overwatch?
0:56:41	Killer_Panda2k11	I mean, imagine trying to go pro with 1+ years of experience going against dudes who've been playing for decades
0:56:54	Killer_Panda2k11	KEKW
0:56:57	LowRatedHighlander	KEKW
0:57:55	dograt19	or if you're far enough away from the scene ie aus
0:58:05	cosmic_sasquatch	renegades
0:59:05	dograt19	@cosmic_sasquatch as I've said, they are far enough away from the Cs scene we're that is possible. don't see people flocking to aus to play here.
0:59:13	asaltytoast	i feel that countries like sweden and france are getting overtaken by smaller eu countries like bulgaria, czechia and even the uk in tier 2
0:59:14	coastalchan	have they said anything about tarik
0:59:15	WRXorcist	Even renegades couldn’t stay single nationality team. How many NA & EU players have they had over the years @dograt19

0:59:27	amutantcookie	physical sport is weird that you can have 18 different nationalities and still be the best in the world
0:59:38	LowRatedHighlander	"brief"
0:59:39	Dynamo_Dave	@killer_panda2k11 compared to more traditional sports, new players don't have much of an advantage of being younger in terms of physical fitness levels. so it all comes down to putting the hours in which is near impossible to match when other players have a decade of an advantage
0:59:56	dograt19	@wrxorcist more talking after that team went to 100 thieves. more the local scene.
1:00:23	WRXorcist	@dograt19 ahhh my bad. Yeah, the current team is all Aussie.

1:06:21	keetnawilson13	I feel like best case scenario is 2 or 3 of them get signed to some new roster, it seems impossible for all 4 or 5 to get an org by now
1:06:23	DeminoTheDragon	i mean what org wants what just played right now
1:06:25	DeminoTheDragon	honestly
1:06:32	LeoooShabani	no disrespect to anyone but junior really do be overrated
1:06:52	keetnawilson13	@DeminoTheDragon not every org wants a top 20 tier one team immediately after signing
1:07:15	keetnawilson13	they don't need to be signed by C9 or some giant rog
1:07:29	hateful_one20	Hey Fl0m, I found a way to catch  some of the steam today! Hope all is well!
1:07:41	DeminoTheDragon	yea but a team that just 0-10 with a *-91* round difference?
1:07:43	DeminoTheDragon	cmon
1:07:47	LowRatedHighlander	eh i think if they can make a showing and qualify then make a showing at something like flashpoint they have a solid chance of an org pickup
1:08:03	keetnawilson13	they're going straight home, they don't have the money to stay in eu
1:08:03	cartelkabus	WHAT DO U THINK ABOUT TURKISH TEAM
1:08:04	LowRatedHighlander	that message made no sense im peepoHigh
1:08:14	c0rkmcnortis	Aren’t they going to frag?
1:08:14	Killer_Panda2k11	I hope BNB aren't hard on themselves and take this as a learning opportunity
1:08:25	c0rkmcnortis	They seem tilted as fuck on Twitter tbh
1:08:44	LowRatedHighlander	bnb makes a solid income. they quite literally win every esea cash cup
1:09:01	DeminoTheDragon	not to mention they had offers but messed up how to communicate with teams
1:09:04	LowRatedHighlander	last one was like 19k
1:09:23	c0rkmcnortis	That’s true, but also what does that say about the state of NA CS…
1:09:28	keetnawilson13	@DeminoTheDragon don't believe reddit on everything, they got in touch with those people and they weren't serious offers
1:09:38	Killer_Panda2k11	Yeah even Liquid, NA top team, is also struggling to make a run in EU tourneys
1:10:05	LowRatedHighlander	covid is cucking na cs pretty hard
1:10:07	Killer_Panda2k11	Sadly it's how the NA scene is due to covid
1:10:11	LowRatedHighlander	and people dont really realize it
1:10:22	Killer_Panda2k11	@LowRatedHighlander NODDERS
1:10:25	imthomas1998	molf?
1:10:28	DeminoTheDragon	their form rn still isn't anything that leaves an org interested to put money towards
1:10:38	DeminoTheDragon	even a small org
1:10:53	Killer_Panda2k11	I mean, Liquid was dominating the scene back in 2019 before covid happened
1:11:05	happymachi	^
1:11:05	c0rkmcnortis	it’s kinda a catch 22, we need orgs to invest in NA to keep the scene alive, but we need more than one for it to be competitive and no one wants to be the first
1:11:09	LeoooShabani	@Killer_Panda2k11 player break*
1:11:13	LowRatedHighlander	their form in NA is pretty solid. which i think is enough potential for an org to support them and then see what theyre capable of after consistently scrimming EU teams
1:11:32	c0rkmcnortis	if c9 does really sign an NA team, that would be very good for the scene, but clock is ticking
1:11:35	keetnawilson13	@DeminoTheDragon they've beat many teams in na who have big orgs, they get better tournament spots than many eu orgs, the problem isn't performance, orgs can't make money in na with such a small fanbase and few sponsorships
1:12:15	sharkkiii_	@c0rkmcnortis i mean like tarik, floppy, rush, autimatic and Stanislaw wouldnt be bad

1:21:26	margiela69	Na orgs are just bad at winning period and losing orgs have no fans
1:21:37	keetnawilson13	like there's literally orgs that spent millions of dollars on a CS league but won't bother spending a little more for a roster to actually compete in flashpoint

1:22:30	Unimatrixz3ro	Heroic in a top 5 team in COVID. I mean... HEROIC then it comes to a lan and real event and that shows the reality...

1:22:48	LeoooShabani	@keetnawilson13 that doesn't matter,flashpoint to this day remains at best tier 2 and the best EU team in flashpoint 1 was Mad Lions who if Im not wrong at best was top 20 at that time,finishing 5th there had no meaning either way.NA's problem is talent and performance, no where close to EU
1:23:06	LowRatedHighlander	Unimatrixz3ro heroic literally just went undefeated in their group that includes astralis and vitality KEKW

1:24:42	HDFlood_	@margiela69 The thing is that esports is relatively young compared to the official sports leagues. What do we have, 20 years tops? NHL, NBA, NFL etc have been around for way longer and have so much more depth and support because of it. People still look at esports and think it's just kids playing games

1:25:32	gordan_jill	@LowRatedHighlander i think those teams would eventually level out and play at the same level the seem to online, given a good year or two of lan events
1:25:33	LowRatedHighlander	oh wait it is online what
1:25:33	margiela69	@hdflood_ true totally agree but if we want esports to get to that level it needs to be managed much better

1:26:57	Uwotm08	Yeah you obviously cannot play across oceans. Renegades pulled out as well.
1:27:07	keetnawilson13	they've made 61k from cash cups in 2021
1:27:20	keetnawilson13	so divide 5 ways they each make around 12k
1:27:30	LowRatedHighlander	ah ok next lan is blast i gotcha
1:27:35	HDFlood_	@margiela69 I feel like exposure matters just as much, because from my knowledge CLASSIC TETRIS has been making the tellies, but I havent really heard much CS and other esports stuffs making the news/tellies but yeah, exposure needs to happen too so it gets the attention it needs. Management is gonna be skewed if we don't have the right amount of people (and the right people don't get me wrong) to look at it and point it out and whatnot
1:27:36	LowRatedHighlander	my b i was way off
1:27:39	wndlxfps	hey fl0m
1:27:41	caffeinetx	CGS paid side money
1:27:41	gordan_jill	yeah i really like this trend of teams letting other teams use their facilities to compete. It kinda brings a grass roots feeling back to the scene
1:27:48	Killer_Panda2k11	BNB get $3k from this pro league
1:27:49	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander I got corrected on this earlier today too.
1:27:55	LeoooShabani	their wiki page gives them 111k$
1:27:56	caffeinetx	CGS was 20k max
1:27:58	HDFlood_	@margiela69 I want to say that there HAS been cases where we did make the tellies, but it isn't as often.
1:28:05	LowRatedHighlander	but even then heroic didnt like shit the bed at cologne. they were like 1 win away from playoffs.

1:28:14	margiela69	@hdflood_ there was eleague that was on tbs
1:28:14	Unimatrixz3ro	please stay on the point that NA has ex major champions benched / retired and they could come back and have an awsome lan team. It could be a top 15 in a month
1:28:17	LowRatedHighlander	Uwotm08 yeah i was way off
1:28:21	caffeinetx	CGS was a side hustle not a full time job
1:28:22	sloveCS	bnb made $91,000 since january 21
1:28:24	keetnawilson13	@Killer_Panda2k11 bnb would've made more staying in na and playing an extra cash cup lmfao
1:28:34	HDFlood_	Oh shit am I talking out of my ass then? Pepega
1:28:35	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander It's an easy mistake to make given that I made it too KEKW
1:28:36	margiela69	The problem w all esports is that salaries scaled much faster than viewership
1:28:47	Zeyzo_	slove is that for the entire team or per member

1:29:04	Killer_Panda2k11	@keetnawilson13 Mad respects to them getting owned by EU instead of chilling in NA getting mad paid
1:29:09	LowRatedHighlander	Uwotm08 what confused the fuck out of me was bnb flew out to EU so i was like "oh sick its another LAN.
1:29:32	cartelkabus	WHAT DO U THINK ABOUT TURKISH TEAM
1:29:33	keetnawilson13	tbf cash cups still don't even give them minimum wage
1:29:39	t3mpod	!scrims
1:29:39	Nightbot	"wat but dey got 16 rouns y dey no winner?" Well you see, this is a scrim, a type of practice where two teams usually play out a full 30 rounds.
1:29:44	LowRatedHighlander	cartelkabus i think thats on the list dont worry
1:29:48	t3mpod	!match
1:29:48	Nightbot	When the next esea season is. Google it if you don't know when.
1:30:00	cartelkabus	OK
1:30:07	margiela69	Imo the tournament circuit should be based more around prize pool like tennis or pokers is but that’s a whole other can of worms
1:30:09	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander They announced it on 20 July: https://pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/2021/07/esl-pro-league-season-14-to-be-held-online/
1:30:23	Killer_Panda2k11	Financial, orgs shouldn't take a chance. There's no guarantee this covid shit will be over in the short time
1:30:30	LowRatedHighlander	Uwotm08 damn KEKW
1:30:39	gordan_jill	@margiela69 i agree with u for sure, i feel like the OG esports orgs are kinda stretching themselves too thin right now ie TSM giving a league pro a multi-million dollar contract
1:31:11	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander Or here if you prefer 280 characters https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/1417484657910812677

1:31:28	Killer_Panda2k11	Wait so does BNB split that $90k between the 5 of them?
1:31:30	LowRatedHighlander	i do be preferring my 280 characters NODDERS
1:31:34	keetnawilson13	@Killer_Panda2k11 yes
1:31:35	c0rkmcnortis	Optic comes back to CS with Tarik as a captain

1:33:00	Uwotm08	ESL definitely pays teams to show up for these besides prize money but I'm not sure orgless BnB qualified for that.

1:38:19	praeter15	gordan_jill: thats fair, but valorant is brand new and made by the biggest esports/gaming company right now so for it to not succeed would take a lot of missteps on Riots part. Its popularity is definitely warranted but imagine how huge and hype it would have been if N A regionals had been a lan event you could attend as a viewer. \

1:40:12	gordan_jill	Like i remember when OWL launched and it was popping off so hard in the beginning because they had a live audience at blizzard studios every week like an NBA game. Being there to watch it adds to much to the esports "experience"
1:40:13	HDFlood_	Also Endpoint Pog
1:40:15	slimrick6	I love poizon on the awp
1:40:28	dograt19	@wrxorcist wasnt it forze?
1:40:33	keetnawilson13	yeah it was forze
1:40:38	keetnawilson13	sinners won premier
1:40:41	LowRatedHighlander	yeah of course. crowds will always make a sport better no matter what
1:40:44	WRXorcist	I thought renegades was group B
1:40:44	Uwotm08	@HDFlood_ Nobody. Group C has EG, group D has Liquid and Team oNe.
1:41:03	Uwotm08	@WRXorcist Renegades had to drop out due to travel quarantine requirements.
1:41:04	LowRatedHighlander	yeah no NA for group b
1:41:05	keetnawilson13	and furia's in D as well i believe
1:41:06	gordan_jill	and watching online and seeing the huge crowds you still get a good sense of the pressure and the stakes and it makes the storylines more interesting when everyone in the crowd is repping their team and stuff
1:41:15	saoram	Renegades out
1:41:17	dograt19	they gave up there spot due to AU covid restrictions. so forze took. spot.
1:41:17	Uwotm08	@keetnawilson13 That's correct

1:47:02	YUGNOVY	look at that cute hot dog
1:47:08	slimrick6	@xeevzz yeah but they been good in the online era I think the last lan was their first time on lan
1:47:56	gordan_jill	I wish there was just a clear path on how to revive NA cs, im biased as im from NA but those OG na gods were just so fuckin cool and interesting and just fun to watch.
1:48:19	HDFlood_	@gordan_jill First things first, this world needs to get its shit together
1:48:21	slimrick6	I think NA needs to go back to that aggressive style they were known for
1:48:37	LowRatedHighlander	gordan_jill yeah like i cant argue that these stories would be more appreciated on LAN thats for sure. i think its just a bit harsh to say online holds no weight or can get into stories is all
1:48:52	HDFlood_	C is so fucking stacked
1:48:54	LowRatedHighlander	cant
1:49:05	HDFlood_	Like holy shit
1:49:07	HDFlood_	Good luck EG
1:49:25	LowRatedHighlander	yeah good fuckin luck EG
1:49:26	gordan_jill	kinda feels like a cycle where orgs arent as interested in NA cs which leads to players not being interested in cs (especially with an alternative like valorant) which leads to lack of talent in the scene which loops back around
1:49:29	LowRatedHighlander	that shit is STACKED
