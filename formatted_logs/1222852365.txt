1:40:03	stinkyjaxon	@praeter15 ill look into getting some
1:40:03	c0rkmcnortis	stinkyjaxon he's on 1440
1:40:14	VOpavs	i think there are too many t1 awpers and not enough rifles, just look at astralis: they had double awps and gave them to glave and k0nfig when the awper is meant to be lucky.
1:40:17	MaxicalB	i went afk it was 9-1 lol
1:40:25	Chibers	@c0rkmcnortis I wish my i5-8400 could handle that lol
1:40:26	Cake315	fl0m is liquid winning because the player play out of their mind because they want offers from better teams?
1:40:32	praeter15	he plays on such a high res but his monitor only supports 800x600 so he cant even see it
1:40:35	Kafkii	VOpavs I think you just described the opposite of your point....
1:40:43	Kafkii	glaive and konfig are tier 1 riflers
1:40:48	c0rkmcnortis	VOpavs that's cuz they dont trust lucky, not because there's too many awpers

2:55:11	lonewulf2004	@LowRatedHighlander gotcha
2:55:12	apoodle10	i think it's a really good thing that valve muting kinda normalizes muting people, i think lots of people are kinda hesitant to do so
2:55:13	whatchu_kno	lol you com in pugs? @STatisfacti0n
2:55:16	Krims0n__	every single auto mute player that i unmuted were unbearable

2:57:04	LowRatedHighlander	Valve doesn’t even have recordings of your audio in mm if you’re getting reported so much you’re auto muted then you deserve it most likely

2:57:43	Krims0n__	@LukeryD agreed 100%
2:57:58	STatisfacti0n	@coobrraa ehh, a little common to get Brazilians in our games that don't speak much English
2:58:10	whatchu_kno	fair enough. I always give ppl a chance, just frustrating when the team falls apart bc someone has someone else muted I guess
2:58:15	sloveCS	@Justhoohaa how long until dnillo gets auto muted?
2:58:16	LukeryD	how do you know if you're auto muted?

2:58:58	justiey	id rather have a teammate auto muted than hear gamer words all day
2:59:00	whatchu_kno	lmao that is prob 5/10 the case @Destructoid5858
2:59:02	SpartanJack_	the type of people that get auto muted by the system, more than likely, are unhappy in someway in there lives
2:59:03	sloveCS	if you're actually planning to play i will
