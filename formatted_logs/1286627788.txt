1:00:00	Cbake987	But that’s exactly it though, they want plug-and-play not to develop someone into the role
1:00:05	TrvsF	nip? management issues? couldnt be

1:00:13	tinyelephant__	lol sign device...so you are right @fl0m but we are talking about eseatag being not good enough
1:00:13	Cake315	the player fl0m is terrible
1:00:14	shrekt1994	fl0m dont you think every org has somehow failed esetag? bar astralis? everywhere he goes pundits say hes misused
1:00:16	javo_	ztr lnz looked better than es3tag
1:00:16	bluehipp0	I had 5 years Latin in School, fluent in English and German native speaker... I should have no problems with most European languages, but it still takes time to learn Swedish... Sadge
1:00:18	Aallesklaarr	ztr was the best they had though

1:07:09	shrekt1994	im glad you said that- flamie was a Machine. kids forget who he was
1:07:11	M3n0H	i feel like flamie fell off a cliff
1:07:11	hemo_tox	@fl0m remember that one ramp clip with flamie. Hah, thats a good one
1:07:15	andrewmedaTV	Flamie was inconsistent

1:07:31	v1k_b	do you know anything about their new coach?
1:07:34	Aallesklaarr	flamie is still a top 6 rated player at majors i think so u cant call him bad lol
1:07:35	llamapede	yeah that's true surprised es3tag was still on the roster for nip i thought they would've dropped him
1:07:38	javo_	they need lekr0 back, hes doing good in dig
1:07:41	mamluku	talent wise, flamie was one of the best players ever in csgo history, he couldn't handle it
1:07:42	Noobster	I heard flamie struggled with understanding bigger picture cs iirc from a s1mple interview
1:07:44	tinyelephant__	he was someone who really really worried about being rendered useless
1:07:45	sickofitlol	@fl0m How can you have self-confidence issues with Zeus as your IGL?
1:07:48	RAFyourbro	so you mean elec is better overall?
1:07:50	risingsun2198	People saying he was never good show they didn't watch CS GO early, Flamie saved them in many games.
1:07:53	KevaCS1	you've seen that Draken is back to cs?
1:07:54	NRSDB	@chumbo767 arent the ratings given in 2.0 scale?.. how tf would he be rated 3.......kek

1:07:57	Mentalstatemike	hampus is fucking flying KEKW
1:08:00	inzert15	btw this is not a bad performance from NiP against Navi on nuke imho
1:08:02	ElaD_O	Flamie had a high cieling but a low floor
1:08:09	SavouryLobster	@fl0m do you think 2014-2016 pro CS were the best years?
1:08:10	tinyelephant__	@Noobster they didnt pair well, but s1mple loved flamie and was gonna bring him with him to MIBR
1:08:10	d0ughtyy	I am a new viewer - 2019

1:08:31	aggressive_duck1	dude had games even towards the end where he was dropping 40
1:08:31	Archit47	flamie was the nuke ramp hold
1:08:32	Treefi	Flamie was good on god back in the day
1:08:33	Chumbo767	@NRSDB he got 2.99 he was 39-8
1:08:33	eldrago125	people only watched flaime recently
1:08:34	hemo_tox	Flamie also seems like a super nice dude :D
1:08:38	smackey11	seized was more of a problem than flamie
1:08:39	agammax	i only seen flamie when he was playing poorly
1:08:41	Chumbo767	with 180 adr
1:08:41	nanerpus_	Or just Thorin trying to throw out his hot takes
1:08:44	Morde24	this year is looking like it's gonna be gooood

1:08:52	mamluku	talent wise flamie was probably top 10 all time
1:08:53	td_gg	this year is the most exciting by far
1:08:55	harjo_x	@fl0m yeah i can agree on that, the only times i watched navi aka flamie, was the time he was "shit" so i thought he was shit
1:08:56	tommathen	2018 boston was the best pro cs @fl0m
1:08:56	ChosenDew	flamie just had to deal with a war general type of igl which was not his style
1:08:56	pedeso	2019 was the best year Kreygasm
1:08:56	Morde24	2018-19 was very good
1:08:58	tinyelephant__	@agammax can I dm you a vid from when he was at his peak at the major?

1:09:06	Treefi	@codysiesta big
1:09:09	shrekt1994	@smackey11 man seized was good but got shit because he was forced to IGL
1:09:11	RAFyourbro	elec is better overall? no?
1:09:11	coryg69	the astralis/VP/C9 runs was so fun like 2017-2019?
1:09:12	aoden1	2018 BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE COPIUM

2:05:05	soggychoccy	yeah my husky goes into her cage when she wants to sleep
2:05:06	iTzBlaKeB	@fl0m so you let them inside or they stay outside?
2:05:09	Treefi	3M channel points may be going down the drain lol

2:05:15	flames2802	is danish and swedish similar? how do they comm?
2:05:15	angus799	@fl0m ive got dog kennels at home which we basically use like a bedroom, go in there and go to sleep. cages dont work like that. get a dog bed for indoors
2:05:18	andrewmedaTV	I only use cages because I rent and can't have any damage

2:05:54	11placeholder11	That’s my family’s philosophy, we let the dogs have full roam because we are make sure that they aren’t chewing stuff. But we also have had our dogs every where with us
2:05:56	harjo_x	@flames2802 danish, swedish and norwegian is similar in someway
2:05:57	D00tel	Honestly fl0m we did that with our older dog, he was also named shadow and it worked for us. But now that he passed, we have him in our display and can have him with us still
2:05:58	dweevers	Actually

3:47:28	barrwonder	@pelloo he would be 2nd awper, still early in his career right? so he would be able to learn from device too
3:47:32	pelloo	@pelloo Same! Life must be so easy if you think that
3:47:33	frenchtoasty	@fl0m where’s chris
3:47:41	gkimball86	@fl0m sometimes clock lancet

3:48:20	angus799	@pelloo lets get zywoo and s1mple on the same team and make one of them rifle just because funny. its so 4Head @barrwonder
3:48:22	YouBigDrip	catJAM
3:48:36	pelloo	@barrwonder you are still putting him in a completely new role with completely new positions. Can only end horribly, just like Grim to Liquid.
3:48:46	enesiaj	Do you have one eye open?
3:48:49	messiah666rc	yes
3:48:50	barrwonder	@pelloo lol comparing a rookie to 2 vet awpers

3:50:39	angus799	@pelloo bet his stats are already up compared to his time on lulquid
3:50:55	pelloo	@pelloo wtf do you mean LUL it's a completely different role, 2nd awper just means that if you have money for a second awp, you are the person to do it. He will still have to learn all new positions because he plays dev1ce positions
3:50:59	shushi2k	this game reminds me of that minigame from stardew valley.

4:09:31	CptJamesBeard	@noorthhh well yeah, but its not like im watching on a different screen than i play right now.. did they choose to bump up the saturation for the stream?

4:10:02	smackey11	@fl0m I think people are still stuck on how he was back in G2 and other French teams where he was entry and not IGL
4:10:05	cosmic_sasquatch	CadiaN is crazy animated but his reads are nuts
4:10:05	rmporr	i would like an igl that gets hype after round
4:10:05	Kafkii	why was my man timed out for that statement
4:10:06	50CEMENT	it is impressive how good apex is good as an IGL compared to all the shox and nbk's attempts at the role
4:10:09	Kafkii	We know chat has said worse
4:10:15	Pappy_Pud	just say it, people underestimate him because he malds @fl0m
4:10:16	Terie54	I think his reputation as historically being an entry fragger hurts him because people think its a brainless role

4:11:06	Arrivall	Entry requires so much game knowledge
4:11:14	zzulfiqar	big vs eg = long ever round/ vs astralis = b every round

4:16:38	angus799	@lo33y he was nearly out of contract
4:16:40	Pappy_Pud	@terie54 I feel the same way but have no concrete evidence proving it
4:16:42	Svimen	Astralis shacky, NIP inconsistent, Na’Vi tited, Vitality not ready; it’s FaZe’s time to shine
4:16:44	supra_nightmare	device has turned out to be a bigger flopski than flopski Kappa
4:16:44	Real_Niels	How the fuck do ppl think NIP wants to replace Device
4:16:45	lo33y	@lo33y ahh okay

4:16:47	holesomebigchungus	farlig?
4:16:47	Exedra711	would definitely give nyholm the fattest erection ever
4:16:48	gkimball86	@s1mply_AnT good point, if he's going to awp he needs to get his
4:16:49	agarlicbear	but fl0m he's only the 11th best player in the world
4:16:49	Smj027	5 is all they get
4:16:50	buggzymalones	@frogoree not at all. Thats just the impression ive gotten. What makes you so obsessed with how I feel about something?
4:16:52	samrol__	A Tactics are poor.
