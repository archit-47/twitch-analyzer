0:31:06	Daviejones72	over tuned may be the correct saying @fl0m
0:31:12	Uwotm08	The game is a bit too CT-sided right now IMHO, looking at the stats from IEM Fall.
0:31:12	mayor_RO	i would say make it like 20 bullets' instead of 25 make it like old days @fl0m
0:31:14	BizarreMark	Sadge only if valve would give us option to buy both guns
0:31:16	BuniVerse	fl0m is smart, I love it
0:31:19	SushiGmz	wait loba and docc are in a team Pog
0:31:21	ekstral0ve	dude the m4 has more fire rate, and 5 more bullets
0:31:22	AJtheDJ_747	SeemsGood
0:31:25	BILA_YT	@BuniVerse +1
0:31:26	Haven_R	thats true but the m4a4 is pointless to use at 3100
0:31:29	Puddin_Wing	strong isn't necessarily overpowered
0:31:33	boxxythegoat	@Haven_R yes
0:31:34	UtkarshJr7	@fl0m You missed this stat https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftDeadEchidnaPJSalt-JOv1dUbwe_NspZT8

0:31:43	B4RTholomew	yeah, they should just bring a4 to 2900 as well

0:31:49	Doccy	i mean some people still use the A4 because of the magazine capacity
0:31:49	mrpapajaa	mae
0:31:53	boxxythegoat	the a4 should get a lower price maybe
0:31:56	TheseTerrors	A4 should be 2900, A1 should be 3100
0:32:03	mayor_RO	: i would say make it like 20 bullets' instead of 25 make it like the older version  @fl0m
0:32:06	Haven_R	if they keep the a1s at 2900 they should make the a4 2900 as well

0:32:24	Hokku	ill be the one to say it chat, old economy was better @fl0m
0:32:26	B4RTholomew	both m4 should be 2900 at this state
0:32:26	Chr_Kloster	What do you think about making the A4 3,3K like the AUG, make it have the same slot as AUG (so you choose between those 2 instead) and the A4 damage gets buffed to AUG-lvl @fl0m
0:32:31	nanerpus_	They should just let you choose which one you want to buy in game and that‚Äôs it
0:32:31	pan1cc3	correct me if im wrong m4a1 is an AK that cant insta headshot and has a silencer bcus it has the same firerate and 4 body right @fl0m

4:51:19	DashX239	Prayge C9 come back and save NACS Prayge
4:51:20	yogi_sb	tsm arent in lcq so they can take all the time they need PepeLaugh
4:51:20	gmor_	RUSH Sadge

4:51:23	CornFedBanana	valorant FEelsBadMan
4:51:23	pedeso	no konfig no win
4:51:32	Killer_Panda2k11	I hope rush doesn't change to val. He's still good for CS
4:51:36	Morde24	is hazed gonna be run out of val like he was cs?
4:51:37	TheBlankSkies	speaking of CoL, do you see them making big changes, they are out of top 20 now

6:55:51	dotalegendery	famas does less damage than galil
6:55:53	rileey01	Refresh only one who likes the galil
6:55:59	Thermophobe	can't expect much from a baguette gun. goes on strike when you need it the most
6:56:01	Otschboh	With a famas you can go take a nap between each bullet LUL @fl0m
6:56:01	dankiyy	old burst NODDERS
6:56:03	co1t25	@fl0m what do think are the imrovements needed for a little higher level like mg

6:56:09	SquiDI0	@dotalegendery same damage and firerate
6:56:11	XeeVzz	sometimes people 1v5 with a galil MmmHmm
6:56:13	boxxythegoat	i like the galil I jusut never buy it since the AK is cheap
6:56:13	V1ZzxX	spray goods but fire rate sucks so somthing clinges
6:56:16	venish66	they prob lowered fire rate cause of how fast burst fire is right
6:56:16	literallyaunicorn	LETSGO 9 IS ALL THEY GET
6:56:17	TLsmf	galil is just an slightly inaccurate m4 @fl0m
6:56:18	k1bsTV	@fl0m The 1st bullet accuracy on the famas is just so trash
6:56:19	wildwaffl3r	Sometime I'll buy a famas and it just clicks, but usually it just feels off to me
6:56:19	TacticalAlmonds	do you care about the burst mode?
6:56:21	V1ZzxX	oh god you jinxed me

6:56:29	mansajoe	@rileey01 Tarik was good with it in his time
6:56:31	Floofys	I just really want to improve. I guess I've never gone into CS with a mindset to actually Git Gud
6:56:35	dankiyy	k1bsTV put it on burst and its the highest in the game
6:56:35	quizhat	They need to improve the 3rd burst on the Famas
6:56:41	dotalegendery	maybe the armor pen is different @squidi0
6:56:42	KEK_doubleU	widepeepoBlanket
6:56:43	co1t25	@fl0m what do think are the improvements needed for a little higher level like mg

6:57:00	From_The_Wrath	whats your opions on the famous flash bang bizon fush buy
6:57:01	SquiDI0	@dotalegendery u right, galil has better armor pen
6:57:05	KeepCalmAndPlayGames	good guy tarik
6:57:06	we3bly	tarik is just amazing at CS
6:57:06	rony9	famas is only good if you are using the commemoration skin üòÖ

7:20:58	apoodle10	the fake crowd noise is based on the reaction of people in the stream, i think it's kinda cool and adds at least some form of crowd reaction

7:37:55	LowRatedHighlander	@snipersimon007 I misread I‚Äôm an idiot
7:38:00	SoporificPanda	yes. in pro sports they get fined for wearing nike or whatever instead of adidas
7:38:01	SaintedPIacebo	in the NFL they fine players for not using the official sponsors of the NFL and usually hte sponsors will cover the fines.

7:38:49	Kafkii	"infamous"
7:38:54	LowRatedHighlander	@snipersimon007 I was agreeing and being a Pepega all at the same time it‚Äôs a special talent of mine
7:39:02	fedoralva	@fl0m the event sponsor won't pay as much if they don't get the main advertising. so the event tries to enforce it. Like Cole and the soccer incident
7:39:27	orezcsgo	@fl0m NBA players and their shoes. Pretty sure not every player on a team has to have the same shoe
7:39:55	SaintedPIacebo	Headphones for the NFL, players had to wear specific headphones during warm ups or they would get fined.
7:40:00	goodstream	Is there a way to check how long ive been following someone?

9:36:14	AncientPistoll	understandable, have a nice day
9:36:14	bl4nk_42_	OneOfUs
9:36:17	rickstercs	if you have a 50% win rate then you're at the rank you deserve
9:36:19	k1bsTV	I'm pretty sure Complexity is buying different FAMASes than I can.
9:36:19	LongRodVonHugeDonger	KEKPOINT @sgpamaar
9:36:23	k1bsTV	Mine don't do that.
9:36:25	valtikk4	and that's only if ur in the middle of rank
9:36:29	rickstercs	u shouldnt have 50% win rate and be ranking up
9:36:30	TheBlankSkies	I think newer players get discouraged by ELO Hell in CSGO
9:36:30	LongRodVonHugeDonger	@iBUYPOWER thoughts? https://s1.cs.money/jzGjKvz_ingame_image.jpg

9:36:57	iBUYPOWER	@sylveonkid1 i already said... nothing Kappa
9:36:58	Destructoid5858	At a lower level though you just get hit then with people who immediately abandon once you are down a round or they die once
9:37:03	kylegrhm	that timing LUL
9:37:03	yaJgnizamA	brutal timing
9:37:11	DerXello	being the underdog is fun until one of your random teammates realises that and give up 5 rounds in
9:37:19	abhi007bond	%? OT
9:37:20	Nightbot	Joris says 10%
9:37:24	ShrapTy	Nope
9:37:24	Eastern_daVinci	jokes on you, I lose more than I win
9:37:25	BuurgerMan	i love drawing games in csgo and ranking up makes no sense to me
9:37:29	VOpavs	people r still mad that EG got legends status in RMR
9:37:29	abhi007bond	!1deag
9:37:30	Nightbot	abhi007bond pops a 1deag on gavincs_ 1TAP
9:37:31	rickstercs	yea i agree
9:37:33	AncientPistoll	My MM rank hasnt changed in the last 3 months even though I have had both large win streaks and large loss streaks
9:37:42	AncientPistoll	I think volvo forgot about me
9:37:43	Speedrulez	i just hope to find out that the dude on the iBUYPOWER channel is just a random that fl0m thought was somehow related to his sponsor KEKW
9:37:45	LongRodVonHugeDonger	fl0m i just ignore you when you talk, what was the question
9:37:56	iBUYPOWER	KEKW
9:38:00	kooshyy	@fl0m I last played valo when yoru got added and was so depressing

9:38:07	MagicMarker1	I once won 13 games in a row no rank up
9:38:08	valtikk4	csgo has more complex ranking than "chess" elo. It's also how consistant you're and yes how often you play
9:38:14	Silent_Dude	I'm pretty sure you're right fl0m, I was watching my friend as he was grinding to immortal and it's insane how low gamesense some people in higher ranks can be

9:38:27	BizarreMark	HELLAWICKED sjoerdtheman
9:38:31	rickstercs	also valorant doesnt do anything about smurf accounts
9:38:35	rickstercs	which i guess is the same for csgo
9:38:36	dankiyy	it is possible to lose more than you gain, but unless your winrate is bad you should be scaling
9:38:38	yaJgnizamA	valorant confuses my simple brain with its heroes and their abilities
9:38:40	sjoerdtheman	BizarreMark HELLAWICKED
9:38:41	NebChilly	after 2 or 3 games i usually get shit on
9:38:43	LongRodVonHugeDonger	hey @fl0m theres a FN AWP Gungnir on CS Money rn for only 15k Pog
9:38:44	two_drop	More games = less elo variance in CSGO
9:38:47	SovietChill	make the elo system transparent ffs peepoRiot
9:38:53	IceRenamonGaming	sjoerdtheman HELLAWICKED
9:39:03	sjoerdtheman	IceRenamonGaming HELLAWICKED
9:39:06	two_drop	the sweet spot for CSGO elo is one or two matches per day
9:39:07	Uwotm08	@fl0m The variance in your rank becomes less wide as you play more. So you rank up not as quickly as you otherwise would. I don't think it's a matter of limiting the amount of Elo you get per match (or Glicko2 points) in MM.
9:39:09	SuperdogHa	HELLAWICKED
9:39:11	valtikk4	wait you get punished for playing more? I thouht it was the other way around
9:39:22	GiraffePig	You can have overall +elo for 50% winrate in Val cos they have hard resets in the Acts, cant work for CS
9:39:28	TVWally	@rickstercs faceit does. just report them. I played 3 games of smurfs and they all got banned for smurfing. and it was obv asf
9:39:30	wee_mckee	@rickstercs what exactly can you do about smurfs?
9:39:31	KDG1H	1850+ Wins in MM still SMFC - Buddy has 400 ranks up 3x faster then me ^_-
9:39:33	BizarreMark	WTFF was the push
9:39:34	Uwotm08	It's mathematically impossible for everybody to win more than they lose, too.
9:39:40	LongRodVonHugeDonger	hey @fl0m theres a FN AWP Gungnir on CS Money rn for only 15k Pog
9:39:41	roman_anderson	odds that cs gets a hard rank reset?
9:39:45	dankiyy	yeah the hidden mmr resets at acts
9:39:54	Night_Legion	Its also great when you come back and by default you place lower every time you come back
9:39:57	Night_Legion	love it
9:40:12	rickstercs	@wee_mckee track user hardware or IP, they get that information anyways why not do someting about people playing valorant or cs on 2 or 3 accounts
9:40:14	dankiyy	its scuffed KEKW
9:40:14	curpyx	@fl0m no troll, beard oil just keep the face moisturized? when i mean beard, i mean real beard

9:40:41	Uwotm08	I've not seen the distribution, no, but I wonder how they got their stats.
9:40:48	KDG1H	@Night_Legion Right? I was SMFC had some life stuff go on. LEFT CSGO for 18 months. Came back got a W to rank back up. Ended up being DMG .... like huh?
9:41:01	larry_the_cable_guy72	this is so sad I cant watch the stream today I have to touch grass
9:41:03	AncientPistoll	One thing I think is they should make global more exclusive. The highest MM rank doesn't have much meaning or clout
9:41:08	PapaUdds	hahaah ffs
9:41:09	Hoagie214	90% golds and silvers in valortant i think. Riot doesnt like that
9:41:10	BizarreMark	Sadge

9:43:40	FrostedxFlames	Rifling always feels better on 128 imo
9:43:42	Alwayspinchy	I notice it if I've played each tkr on the same day
9:43:47	k1bsTV	@fl0m I can only real feel the difference in a spray or sometimes in a peek.

9:43:49	Krud	@PapaUdds they did a decent blindtest with random people. you could play dm for 15 minutes on a server, that didN#t tell you at what tick it was running. most of them couldn't tell the difference

9:45:25	Alwayspinchy	there's only 128 tick smoked anyway

9:45:28	adry0211	i know smokes only on mirage kek
9:45:29	yaJgnizamA	i learned vertigo smoke from watching stream :)

9:45:45	dinnerparty	i learned all my smokes in MM but they dont hit there either, thoughts?
9:45:50	LW88	i struggle to play 64 tick because sprays and shots just dont land, but i also suck on 128 tick, it just feels better to suck on
9:45:50	LongRodVonHugeDonger	CoL would be winning more if it was 128 tick fl0m
9:45:56	AncientPistoll	Whether people can tell 128 tick is not a good metric IMO. If people cant tell about bad water quality they might still get sick from it.

9:46:35	M2wits	128 tick with something new with the ranking system that people can grind for instead of faceit/esea and such
9:46:38	batsbanaan_	that would be nice
9:46:42	M2wits	that's a sick idea
9:46:42	IamBagel	I think that's a good argument for not doing higher tickrate. CSGO has done well without it, why spend more money

9:47:26	LW88	@IamBagel actually the argument valve likely uses internally
9:47:31	Aderu__	what does valve put their money into? like, does all go to fkin dota cause it feels that cs aint gettin shit
9:47:44	k1bsTV	@fl0m That's EVERY company's approach to a lot of things, to be fair.
9:47:49	Shimshammie	I thought we weren't doing Econ 101?
9:47:50	TheBlankSkies	CSGO has to have the worst revenue to update ratio lol
9:47:55	BizarreMark	YEP if ain't broken, don't fix

9:48:01	itsklaushd	hi!!!!
9:48:10	uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh	CS community doesn't like changes KEKW

9:48:24	k1bsTV	@fl0m Especially in NA, I think people are just CLAMORING for shit to get excited about. I agree totally
9:48:24	AncientPistoll	If valve releases an empty case people will probably still open it KEKW
9:48:32	IamBagel	I personally agree with that, valve could make more money by spending even a teeny bit of money.

9:48:43	Uwotm08	@Morde24 While Valve have no obligation to do well for its customers, the customers will quickly stop playing Valve games if they neglect them. CS:GO has way more players than TF2, for example.
9:48:49	theBaboda	sleeeeppyyyy respectable NODDERS
9:48:49	Alwayspinchy	@ancientpistoll they already do that
9:48:49	Xtrememan	512 tick?

12:26:59	Doccy	ahhh okay, wanted to make sure it wasn't my player messing up
12:27:01	Puddin_Wing	well that was one of the better cutscenes i've seen in a farcry game
12:27:22	Doccy	most likely becuase fl0m is streaming at 60 and this game cutscenes are at 30
12:27:24	mekhmdfh	@doccy do scrims start always at 2 PM?

12:31:37	lotsachickens	@shakezla it's a fun game, but nothing new or revolutionary
12:31:43	Dynamo_Dave	he said he was coming in. but he didn't tell him he was coming in through the windshield
12:31:54	macbookfps	fl0m are we sure you passed your driver's test IRL? like this is some abysmal driving
12:31:59	Puddin_Wing	it's a far cry game. If you enjoy your far cry games, you'll enjoy this game I'd wager.
12:32:07	Puddin_Wing	They don't reinvent the wheel
12:32:19	lotsachickens	^what he said, it's just like last far cry just diff environment, story and some additions
12:32:19	shakezla	@lotsachickens Bet, thanks dude. thats why I stopped playing farcry games. they seemed to just be the same game after 3
12:32:42	Puddin_Wing	I enjoy the gameplay loop every now and then. It takes me a while to finish a far cry game because they get a little samey
12:32:44	Puddin_Wing	but they're well made games
12:32:50	lotsachickens	ye but just like every far cry it's very enjoyable just shooting and exploding things

12:34:54	shakezla	@Puddin_Wing I was just about say that, the villain in 3 was genuinely well thought out
12:34:58	JillyKing	@shakezla The thing is, they‚Äôre not changing anything. There‚Äôs a model that people like (not me personally, too repetitive) so why should they change it? The base is the same, they just keep adding new things as well as better graphics. Not to mention the giant maps
12:35:00	Doccy	far cry 3 is great, i didn't play 4 but heard it was more 3. far cry 5 was fairly different, and i enjoyed parts of it. and new dawn was ehh

12:35:37	Gearslayer360	i think you have to get on the ship
12:35:41	Doccy	ya know i forgot about primal
12:35:49	Puddin_Wing	throwing the spear in primal was the most satisfying far cry weapon imo
12:35:53	JillyKing	@puddin_wing You‚Äôre a caveman like flom too
12:36:00	Puddin_Wing	you're not wrong
12:36:04	shakezla	farcry primal was just turok. cant change my mind
12:36:15	ShallowSloth	feeny actually had sex with a cave man once
12:36:15	Puddin_Wing	not nearly enough raptors to be turok
12:36:18	Puddin_Wing	the fuck are you on about
12:36:37	lotsachickens	watch flom fall down
12:36:43	Doccy	the only criticism of far cry 3 i have is the main baddie is kinda uninteresting

12:56:04	JillyKing	@deaths_reaper1233 As a first language English speaker I 100% agree

12:58:59	JillyKing	When I studied Old English, it‚Äôs so hilarious. Basically, it‚Äôs a mish mash fuck up of a load of different languages that formed to create a language that doesn‚Äôt make sense, and has very little consistent rules that most other languages have @deaths_reaper1233
