1:51:01	Darkagespawn	SeemsGood
1:51:03	im2meta4u	fl0m are we gonna watch NIP-Gambit or Astralis-Vitality?
1:51:04	ragin_irishmann	NA
1:51:04	Tor2gamuz	@huskyking6 both promotion and elimination takes place at same time
1:51:06	zitelzTV	thank you @Bolly, for the longest time I was sure it was "Road to Rio" PepeLaugh
1:51:06	ZORO1800	anyone else think Ancient is really boring to watch?
1:51:09	TROPIIX_	@torp3d0_ oh nice thank you :)
1:51:16	DeoMors	Astralis Vitality for elimination is a watch for sure
1:51:20	sh1f0	nip gambit is a banker
1:51:20	future_jason	This is why we need C9, Liquid gives us hope before taking it away and then C9 gets that crazy tournament run before going quiet. Right now we’re just getting Liquid making us sad
1:51:25	ChosenDew	Astralis Vitality happens first
1:51:30	mrpapajaa	Liquid needs an ancient
1:51:30	ragin_irishmann	I am sorry that your american team has been eliminated.
1:51:34	Slasher	if liquid dont make top 3 at blast would you make roster changes, or is it inevitable at this point anyway
1:51:55	lavavex	Ancient not real map
1:51:55	whitechocolate64	@fl0m The astralis vitality game starts 30 minutes earlier than nip gambit anyways
1:51:56	curpyx	@slasher i would kiss u
1:52:02	vso11	Hey look at the bright side. At least we don’t have to wake up early to watch liquid lose anymore!

1:52:38	ketchup_l8r	i think fallen is going to leave for complexity
1:52:41	XeeVzz	bro furia are actually making playoffs wtf
1:52:44	E_x3CuTioN3R	What seems to be the problem with Liquid?
1:52:44	vchair23	yeah but how flom, nobody lines up to fallen, and replacing stew doesn't seem right

1:52:49	Madfish2021	-grim -stewie
1:52:50	hyperstef	first Perkz leaving C9, now Liquid making changes Sadge
1:52:55	shmoobs_	@fl0m c9 jack tweet
1:52:57	ScoutPack151	I am scared for Liquid man. I love this current roster so much, I just think they need to change something outside of the game to fix some consistency issues.
1:52:59	torp3d0_	but who do you swap on liquid? stew is the glue,
1:52:59	future_jason	Time for a Blast run or losing to Astralis
1:53:01	ragin_irishmann	Fallen from South America, other are from north america, that is an issue.
1:53:02	xisplo	lets hope fallen gets dropped
1:53:02	peat_shack	a blast run would be the exception at this point

1:53:23	Madfish2021	He’s too inexperienced tho
1:53:25	Plebcake_	do you think they need a more upbeat IGL? Their demeanor is always negative or quiet, even if winning.
1:53:29	shrekt1994	i like this roster, but who do see changing?
1:53:32	Woehey	They need to let grim more loose

1:53:33	sealer9	bro elige said fallen wants to play one way and other people a different. there is an obvious disconnect
1:53:35	ScoutPack151	Twistzz is so underrated
1:53:39	Fillmeupbois	Maybe -grim + jks?
1:53:41	XeeVzz	twistzz is such a talent idc , he is my favorite NA player
1:53:47	Ronnie143	what if NA combined the best players of TL and EG together? @flom imagine seeing brehze with NAF?
1:53:47	future_jason	Someone pay Valve to just let nitr0 be in a call with Liquid when they play, shit maybe that’ll do something for them

2:05:57	Slasher	the big question is if ESL, Blast, DH return to running those events next year (ESL Chicago/NY/Anaheim, Blast LA/Miami) or if like many event organizers see how expendable some of them were and decide to ditch them
2:05:57	torp3d0_	@fl0m the owners with the most imports were the ones trying to get rid of that rule KEKW

2:11:14	hyperstef	@sevengaming_tv same brother Sadge
2:11:17	vaderhasasthma	What teams would be involved in an NA roster shuffle? Could we see some of the Extra Salt players and a handful of the online era NA talents make their way onto one of the big orgs?
2:11:17	kachows	Chat is it confirmed olof retires after this year ?
2:11:18	hyperstef	@Izeta233 no real coach
2:11:20	jesusy666	@Trashbait Imo that makes it all the worse. They have the potential but they haven't met it in a long time

4:51:13	dorfenklus	Hobbit brings so much experience too
4:51:13	McBubba03	@sleeeeppyyyy if I want NA to win I gotta go for FaZe now, I believe Twistzz is the last NA player in the major if I'm not mistaken.

6:18:21	Killer_Panda2k11	I think the only team that has a hell's chance in beating NAVI is Gambit
6:18:23	brotherman2222	gambit has the best shot, they usually beat navi especially outside of finals
6:18:23	jzderf	NiP destroyedAstralis because Ast had 0 to offer. They were read round after round

6:18:35	OGWerp	OKAY CHAT, hear me out! Last team to win a major was Cloud9, Furia qualified through the NA RMR, junior is still contracted Furia win confirmed

6:18:42	yaJgnizamA	NiP vs NaVi final
6:18:42	bl1pblap	are magisk and dupreeh too established for this lackluster showing to drop their stock with the contracts expiring?
