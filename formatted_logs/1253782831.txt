1:36:40	Puddin_Wing	Like there are shirt companies where I'm a large and some where I'm a xxl

1:36:51	dolanmolan_	@bangbang300 you can probably search that on the internet and get a good answer
1:36:55	bluehipp0	I think in EU they changed the M/L sizes a long time ago and made them bigger?

6:03:24	grno	okay got it
6:03:34	crustydumper_	Nevada relies heavily on revenue from high sales taxes on everything from groceries to clothes, sin taxes on alcohol and gambling, and taxes on casinos and hotels.18 This results in an overall state imposed tax burden of 8.23% of personal income for Nevadans. It is the second-highest-ranking overall tax burden of the states on this list, but still a very respectable 22 out of 50 when compared to all states.4
