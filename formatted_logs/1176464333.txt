1:57:51	NebChilly	@NebChilly yea they always look good but when it comes to game 7 against the top teams in the league they never capitalize tbh
1:57:52	sloveCS	WHOA
1:57:54	devanb97	@amutantcookie true, I don‚Äôt disagree Id love more teams in Canada but business wise you‚Äôll always have the canadian fans, growing a US market like Seattle or Houston makes a lot more sense business wise

I've been playing csgo for quite a while and I'm feeling like boosting some girl gamers (preferably ones that look kinda good, I'd appreciate if you could send a picture before beginning.) and this because often when I talk to girls otherwise they don't take my csgo-skill in to consideration. Many girls through the years did friendzone me and I'm really tired of all douchebags taking the girls who deserve better.

3:59:44	priiide_	elige more consistent
3:59:49	RyanGDS	twist may pop off more, but elige is the god of consistency
3:59:53	lvlonedvlone	Elige spray is undoubtedly one of the best worldwide
3:59:56	dolev801	elige has a really cute dog @fl0m
3:59:57	devanb97	You and tucker going to do another silver cast? @fl0m
3:59:58	zefixlikescsgo	@priiide_ aw hell nah
3:59:59	dcn1ghtwing	you can argue that liquid is the most skilled team in the entire game. their problem has always been mental. they tilt silently and dont forget bad rounds

4:09:13	TheBlankSkies	Im disgusted that Liquid doesnt scout the NA scene for AWP talent. They are not giving back to the NA community that made them. The literal #7 team in NA according to HLTV has an AWP player that can IGL and they pass on him.
4:09:14	LucidR9	I could see oSee on liquid

4:09:58	kelen2003	Liquid the problem was emotional because when they lose and they got mental down they play like trash but when they winning they playing out of mind
4:09:59	darkioul	awper is too important to take huge risk
4:10:00	5Rule_	WHEN ADREN DIDNT EXIST
4:10:00	jebby__	i know karrigan has said he sometimes doesnt mind entrying for that reason
4:10:02	IshnuKal	arT basically
4:10:03	D1srvpts	I know a washed streamer who is an igl awper they could sign PauseFish
4:10:05	LowRatedHighlander	And if he does he mostly uses the neutral knives
4:10:06	terryfiedman	Karrigan is the best example imo, dies first a lot
4:10:08	dankiyy	its the gla1ve way
4:10:10	Destructoid5858	Fl0m is preparing JoJo to take over for Fallen.
