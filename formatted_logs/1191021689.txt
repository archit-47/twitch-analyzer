2:02:39	EZClapEZClapped	@fl0m I think Valve needs to take the F1/FIA approach to things. F1 teams/drivers are GOING to push the limit ALL the time. It's the job of the FIA to enforce the rules and keep teams in check. Valve is doing the same thing. It sucks for teams/coaches, but you need to keep your sport's integrity.

5:01:15	mrpapajaa	Tarik should do iron cast
5:01:18	NextDoorGuy	@marcus7445, hard disagree, its super easy to scam credit cards and whitewash the money through nft's, you dont need millions like irl art
5:01:26	cranidos_11	BatChest Omg money laundering
5:01:28	LucidR9	look at that red suit fl0mGasm
5:01:39	jbirdblue	@marcus7445 Its not the actual art that drives the price of art it is the scarcity. NFTs have zero scarcity because actual consumption isn't limited
5:01:40	M3n0H	i love slasher KEKW
5:01:47	fireblazz_phoenix	BlameF thrown out of Coomplexity...into Astralis then?

5:02:07	LucidR9	jbirdblue awful comparison - I can paint one line on a canvas and call it art
5:02:13	bendoverson99	the device haircut
5:02:18	LucidR9	and if someone wants to launder money - they can do it too
5:02:24	kappameister777	not being personal to heroic but do you think they single handedly fuck the CS scene with the coaching scandals @fl0m
5:02:24	jbirdblue	@LucidR9 Why is Banksy or Picasso famous?

5:02:30	Suhlad_	chat i need to sleep when is liquids next game????
5:02:35	marcus7445	@nextdoorguy Think you misunderstood what i was trying to say. Ofc you can launder money through NFT’s, but you can do the same with art. And it might be easier, or for other purposes
5:02:38	LucidR9	jbirdblue bruh - I didnt say that famous artists were like NFTs
5:02:46	Bolly	@Suhlad_ we won't know schedule until round 1 is over

5:04:44	jbirdblue	@marcus7445 WHen i am googling a digital art piece and consuming it digitally there is no alteration to its consumption. When i google mona lisa it is digital consumption of a physical piece which isn't perfect replication. Scale, etc. all differ
5:04:45	TDL3	don't get political
5:04:47	marcus7445	@nextdoorguy Totally agree, but I think the people who launder money, do it for such large amounts that the bottumline doesnt matter
5:04:51	macbookfps	dnillo ah gotcha, that's cool!

7:54:21	LowRatedHighlander	Gacho oh im not saying theyre good. im just saying like players that are seeing successful transfers into the valorant scene showed good current form in cs before then. so to think it makes sense to essentially stop trying in cs because youre going to valorant but dont have a contract (which we would probably see rumors of if they did have them lined up ) is just dumb
7:54:22	friendlymackerel	grim is gonna hypercarry
7:54:26	Gacho	@LowRatedHighlander i mean look at players like scream and hiko. when were they last good at cs:go. and they got high level chances because of their histroy

Minimum is prob 60% if lucky but these skins dont circulate a lot so 60% is also unlikely imo. Either way it's a borrowed skin from a skin collector.
