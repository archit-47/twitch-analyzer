0:21:38	k1p_csgo	Legend Status is given to all players that make it out of group stage at a major. If 3 or more of these players stay together then they get invited to the next major. If a player leaves the team then they lose legend status. If less then 3 players stay together then an extra spot at the qualifier is added

2:07:16	Jay_rb	WTF bro 15 ads FUCKFL0M
2:07:20	SoporificPanda	the internet really do be wild. it is like IRL before workers discovered organized labor
2:07:25	rastava98	@Dameey_  good question
2:07:25	silviu_cs	We LOVE ads here
2:07:26	TheLastHydr4	While Twitch can certainly improve in some areas, its still up to the streamer to do do what they can
2:07:35	LowRatedHighlander	WTF fl0m I got 69 ads fl0mSlam
2:07:37	Cacemen	@fl0m put a channel point reward to make you play ads.
2:07:50	zombl3r	A lot of the focus always gets directed towards the negative shit twitch does, but that's just human nature. It's a lot easier to focus on the negative.
2:07:51	kannar_tv	@LowRatedHighlander EZ nice

2:08:05	curpyx	hi fl0m

2:09:04	ajaxhelios	@yobtih Man couldnt hit a shot KEKW his inner simp couldnt aim
2:09:04	2020numbers	fl0m if you dont have a contract does twitch just decide when to run ads on a channel or what?
2:09:13	Dameey_	i've seen tarik on stream, obviously a joke to an extent, say if he was having a bad game he'd just try to get brehze fragging

2:09:38	zombl3r	I think a lot of the shit they do affects the content creators more than us viewers so I really don't have anything to complain about
2:09:42	6dawn	why would tarik come back to cs when he's making more streaming rn
2:09:42	omareloff	What up dood long time
2:09:47	ImFreedoom	best igl of all time in you opinion? like not the most succesful but the one you know could walk in a team and make a difference?

3:41:29	SquaredG	@fl0m heap cant get a break this map
3:41:32	m_adar_a1	Is it because Rito is busy with Worlds? and thus the negligence for Valorant? They should have different teams for both right?
3:41:32	Nightbot	Latest video: How Practice in a CS:GO Team REALLY Works! - https://youtu.be/GHhpqhjTpf8

3:55:22	supra_nightmare	@fl0m  does it not click with anyone at all that little kids are basically running these orgs? most of these players are still kids with little to no life experience! this is why I've said this from the beginning everybody in CS go needs to have an approved agent.
3:55:26	odiebtw	and he "only" cheated twice

3:55:33	Nightbot	Joris says 49%
3:55:35	kenichidc	HUNDEN said TeSeS knew about it and taught him how to better use it
3:55:35	Raithorn	@bigfani how has the new aim trainer been?
3:55:38	MigBryan	were they the best team back when the couches were cheating???
3:55:40	capprobott	its just good gamesense kekw
3:55:40	Dodgers0n	@LowRatedHighlander ty. So they just completely forgot a region?
3:55:41	odiebtw	Like two good choices
3:55:44	XeeVzz	@fl0m you forgot the part where hunden shared a private heroic file to other competitor KEKW
3:55:46	kenichidc	ALLEDEDLY*
3:55:47	ibunnydude2	Coach said stack b, they came b. Wow coach actually cheating Kappa LUL LUL
3:55:49	bluehipp0	I swear, Joris is just looking at the score...
3:55:49	jackx14	i just cant imagine why the coach wouldnt say anything tho
3:55:50	bigfani	Raithorn pepeLaughing i havent played it bigfan1Angel
3:55:52	LowRatedHighlander	@dodgers0n like actually forgot about them
3:55:57	highdrati0n	sounds like he told them and threw then under the bus when he hits busted
3:55:59	LowRatedHighlander	Didn’t book or plan for them at all
3:56:00	jackoire	I think cadian is clean. he would not cheat
3:56:00	lolypop98	cant other people in the room see the coach's screen?
3:56:03	dankiyy	its not like finding a streamsniper LUL
3:56:11	LowRatedHighlander	So they just didn’t get to participate in the last chance qualifier
3:56:16	abhi007bond	gg go next

3:56:32	highdrati0n	fl0mLurk
3:56:33	bluehipp0	it's like baseball players saying: There's such a thing as *STEROIDS*?!!

3:56:36	moosE3knucklE	Dig lookin so good

3:56:59	rony9	2 matches :)
3:56:59	LowRatedHighlander	Holy shit I blinked and dig took the lead
3:57:01	supra_nightmare	esports suffers from a ginormous lack of professionalism overall as an industry
3:57:05	MigBryan	Kappa
3:57:05	Speedrulez	dweevers speedr25Hey
3:57:06	Cacemen	the fact that they lost still don't matter he still used it

3:57:08	jackx14	theres no way at least one of them didnt know IMO
3:57:09	jockst3r	ok but then the fact that they did lose one of the match it makes it more believable that hunden did try to hide it from the players
3:57:09	Raithorn	I thought it was some 30 matches?
3:57:11	yourducky	spud
3:57:12	LowRatedHighlander	Yeah only 2 Kappa

3:57:28	petah1993	that was sick
3:57:28	n0r13k	This Dignitas team look fantastic, great to see young Swedish talent cut through. This f0rest guy looks great, plays like a veteran but with the aim of a 17 year old, Hallzerk could be a great AWPer, and friberg knows how to hold down a site as an anchor pretty god damn well.
3:57:29	snik1e	that was disgusting

6:04:02	Nightbot	hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
6:04:03	AndyJlol	m4a1s is to good

6:04:11	Typ1calTV	a1 meta?!

6:04:12	Archit47	I would rather get a self drive rental in India than take a cab anywhere
6:04:14	jockst3r	the pro's still using the A4 is like the pro's refusing to use AUG and SG back before the nerf of them

6:05:55	jockst3r	@fl0m the pro's still using the A4 is like the pro's refusing to use AUG and SG back before the nerf of them
6:05:58	Dankner	Maybe because he plays B he wants the extra bullets only thing i can think of

6:11:16	cloutburstgg	i really am starting to doubt blameF as an IGL. I feel he would be better as a pure entry and complexity get another IGL, but i could be wrong

6:13:53	bigdaddydave1	man, when they first got that lineup with obo, rush, poizon, konfig, and blamef was just on a different level. if that roster would have stayed, I really think that col could have stayed consistently top 5
6:13:55	need_a_name__	16-0
6:13:59	Piethrouer	complexity needs another NA player, only thing that can bring them back
6:14:03	dankiyy	leaving the same night you mentioned you were going home after playoffs is kinda pepeSus

6:32:27	Killer_Panda2k11	@co1t25 64 tick is MM, 128 is Faceit/ESEA
6:32:29	kannar_tv	The_Ganznoob only love peepoHuggers
6:32:32	BuurgerMan	Sad OG arent in the major couldve been a serious dark horse
6:32:33	Ravager72	cold joins and they get 16-0'd twice. Coincidence? I don't think so... monkaW @fl0m
6:32:36	LowRatedHighlander	@co1t25 jump throws are dependent on the server. A jump throw lineup on 64 tick won’t work on 128 tick
6:32:38	r_udra	It goes further on 128 tick EZ

7:50:31	Deaths_Reaper1233	@Falcon_12 I don't have that big of a head, so I can't attest to fit, but as for functionality, it's a fantastic headset. Had mine for 3 years and still works great

7:50:52	Nomad182	it felt like they were trying to tread water until a roster stuck and you've had obo situation/poizon injury/k0nfig injury all somewhat stringing together into a clusterfuck. Rainge
7:50:53	Falcon_12	@luckyyeven I know it's wireless. I was confirming that it was the artctis pro.
7:50:56	BizarreMark	monkaHmm maybe they knew konfig was gonna leave
7:50:57	rygaardhansen	I think BlameF calling have been an issue
