4:05:27	Thugs_Bunny268	@fl0m I highly watch some form of the last match of the furia vs liquid in on ur down time
4:05:30	justiey	liquid came back on the last map fromlike 15 to 11
4:05:31	LowRatedHighlander	i think its mostly because of their t side
4:05:39	vchair23	fl0m why do you think they swapped elige/stew on mirage? elige been playing cat/b stew conn
4:05:40	itz_shippy	I'm just gonna say it, Guerri did not look like some coach out there, he played pretty well considering the circumstances
4:05:44	LowRatedHighlander	like their t side inferno is so explosive

4:05:51	TheRenegadeRonin	Eliige Stew and NAF love inferno, and fallen does too when he's hot, so its a good map for them

4:07:31	LucidR9	he was #18?
4:07:31	mcWoodst3r	SPUNJ/Machine is top shelf, b-stream and the rest are fine
4:07:32	bobson300101	HARRY and HUGO supremacy
4:07:33	huronvalley21	no I agree 100 @LucidR9
4:07:38	LucidR9	jesus he's gonna fly up
4:07:46	LucidR9	harry and hugo is the cutest bromance
4:07:48	justiey	@LucidR9 yeah i agree. you can tell they are def less experienced casters, but i still enjoy it
4:08:02	TheRenegadeRonin	B stream did good, they just need a little more game knowledge to feel a little less like spectators and more like comentators
4:08:02	Thugs_Bunny268	i love spungj but hugo and harry >>
4:08:04	acey_j	the casters were hyped and that's really all you need from esports casters. Machine is elite, you can't expect anyone to be at his level for play by play
