6:49:21	RyanL707	@007deman the fact that he has made clutch moments and plays is great. his only clutch moment during that series saved the game. If electronic and s1mple were not there to save his ass half of that series they would not have won colonge. There is no debating that. His in game IQ is out of this world, his decision making at times is questionable. Not once did i say CS is all about KD. As a whole he is the weakest link on Navi.

7:28:54	LucidR9	liverpool are a dark horse this season - every liverpool fan ever - plays against a 10 man chelsea for an entire half, cannot score
7:28:55	FishandFri	the items show up on turrest too visually, atleast it used too
7:29:02	Speedrulez	we should still have won @lucidr9 but the general consensus is that chelsea parking the bus made winning for either party less likely, which is huge testimony to their defence
7:29:08	GFYMeowMix	the red card didn't change their formation
7:29:13	GFYMeowMix	it just had them turtle in harder
7:29:24	LucidR9	de wed cawd didnt change de fowmashun

7:37:02	Killer_Panda2k11	@GFYMeowMix I feel like those are the superficial fans that jumped on at the peak of the teams. As soon as things go slightly bad, they want the team to revamp
7:37:08	Zeyzo_	SukksGaming No idea
7:37:09	LucidR9	salah and mane feel they both need to individually CARRY liverpool, because they're down right now, when liverpool are performing, you'll be hard pressed to find a better winger pairing with better chem

8:12:29	Nightbot	Joris says 33%
8:12:31	praeter15	you can make the game go forever or every 5 stages you can choose to fight the "final" boss and end the run
8:12:34	venish66	@praeter15 ok cause i always thought it was endless
8:12:43	praeter15	theres a couple ways to end a run
8:13:10	praeter15	fl0m stage 8 you can go thru a portal and end the run there
8:13:24	praeter15	going to stage 8 is easier than fighting mithrix tho peepoSit

8:13:36	sleeeeppyyyy	!!deag
8:13:39	ChemicalScum	@venish66 you can loop stages forever, difficulty always goes up
8:13:48	LowRatedHighlander	fl0m i dont recommend looping if youre trying to fight mythrix. if you want to obliterate or keep looping thats a different story

8:13:50	Nightbot	sleeeeppyyyy pops a 1deag on ile9000 1TAP
8:14:01	LowRatedHighlander	but when fighting mythrix is best that you do it on the first loop
8:14:02	420Enigma	fighting mythrix with stage 10 items is definitely tougher
8:14:07	TheBanano	risk it to get the biscuit
8:14:38	LowRatedHighlander	and praeter15 i dont see that stat on the profile stats page so no clue

8:16:41	Lawsn_	;)
8:16:42	420Enigma	@ praeter15 my fastest is probably somewhere around ~45min. There's a challenge for somebody for an under 30 minute run isn't there?

8:17:07	Lawsn_	You look like a dad in it, 3 kids minimum, but you'd still make a great dad
8:17:10	praeter15	if there is i just did drizzle and rushed to obliterate
8:17:16	Lawsn_	The dad everyone wants
8:17:55	420Enigma	still a pretty fast rush through drizzle, gotta get to stage 8
8:19:37	siiiif	opens a portal
8:19:40	LowRatedHighlander	i looked through the run history and i have an artificer run at 44:17 praeter15
8:19:45	praeter15	nice
8:19:55	praeter15	i forgot run history was a thing
8:20:02	LowRatedHighlander	fl0m if you take the gold portal after buying it. has to be bought before you start the tp
8:20:05	LowRatedHighlander	welp
8:20:13	The_Ganznoob	KEKWiggle
8:20:21	LowRatedHighlander	yeah but it doesnt have all my runs praeter15 so idk if thats the fastest
8:20:25	420Enigma	gold alter takes you to an alternate stage, time is paused on this stage so as long as you can complete it it's (free) items
8:20:56	Papa_Reesty	KEKWiggle
8:21:44	The_Ganznoob	pepeSus
8:21:55	LowRatedHighlander	fl0m if you want to do the gold alter. you have to buy it before you start the tp event. it spawns a gold portal similar to the blue one. takes you to a place where you fight a giant gold stone titan. the fight is a little much to describe over twitch chat
8:22:07	LowRatedHighlander	it involves you buying alters to be able to damage the boss
8:22:28	praeter15	Aurelonite isnt really worth to get other than getting the logbook entry
