0:04:34	froster5226	had*
0:04:43	Archit47	ye but they lose #1 if they did
0:04:48	LowRatedHighlander	they should have pitted the first safety car for sure

0:05:42	froster5226	@TheDraxxman what's the change you're talking about im relatively new - is it that they only let some of the cars unlap themselves?

0:05:47	TheDraxxman	yea
0:05:50	BonBonVal	here fpr the music
0:05:56	TheDraxxman	all lapped cars usually unlap themselves
0:06:02	TheDraxxman	and that takes more laps to complete
0:06:06	froster5226	but they cut it short so there would be 1 lap
0:06:08	froster5226	got it
0:06:09	TheDraxxman	so they let the ones in the middle go
0:06:09	Archit47	they have rose water
