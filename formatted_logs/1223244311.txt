0:59:41	LongRodVonHugeDonger	The blockchain doesn’t lie. Even if you try to save it, it’s my property. You’re just angry that you couldn’t afford this priceless masterpiece. Even if you could, your fingers couldn’t even click fast enough to get one of the 10000 NFTs sold. You’re just mad you don’t own what I own. So, delete that screenshot, or I swear, you’ll be hearing from my lawyers.

1:53:46	F1niteCS	CuddlyCroissant that's a personality issue. If you're playing a team-based tactical FPS where information and communication are king, you can't have guys who have shit coms.
