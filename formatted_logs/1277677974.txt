4:44:06	jhoule9082	I’m sem when I que with my nova 2 buddy I feel like im in fpl
4:44:23	sentrox46	what i find annoying is i was gold 4 in mm, i took months off, came back rankless, played one game and lost and they put me in silver
4:44:26	ToothlessTacoFPS	funny number KEKPOINT
4:44:26	Gour204	^^ agreed @jhoule9082
4:44:27	Stogie6	nrwgn It's weird, my MM games lately I haven't seen much for smurfs or cheaters unless they hide it really well. It's been REALLY weird. MM has been a decent experience for me
4:44:28	ptrayz	nice comeback
4:44:30	ItsAho	I'm faceit lvl 5 but sem ranks are fucked
4:44:37	Chukenthe3rd	MM is indeed plagued with cheaters @fl0m

4:45:02	soccerdude178	Whats the video called?
4:45:07	Curticuss	is there a link to that video? it seems interesting and im bored lol
4:45:10	s1mply_AnT	I haven't seen a blatant cheater in MM for probably 6 months or so
4:45:21	YorkshireTerrorist	I've been MG2 and Silver4 (and every one in between) ... i don't feel so mystified anymore xD
4:45:22	scribblesper	leetify csgo rank distribution
4:45:37	Madfish2021	EU MM works but once you hit DMG-LE you never know whos cheating and whos legit
4:45:39	sentrox46	i dont get why they do that @DixensCider  like i said, i wasnt even close to silver, neiother is supreme, take a long time off, come back lose your first game then silver, so dumb\
4:45:40	iVex	@s1mply_AnT hadn't seen one in a while... Then I got 2 in 3 games.

4:48:10	Gour204	the ranking system is ruining the game to be honest. it needs a full over haul, like i lose nothing if it resets. im Silver Elite with 10k hours in the game
4:48:14	iVex	@DixensCider You paid for prime now.
4:48:20	origamilover01	@sentrox46 the most common thing i've heard is that people have more fun cheating than not cheating. which does raise the question, why not just play a game you have fun at without cheating? i dunno really, it's definitely strange
