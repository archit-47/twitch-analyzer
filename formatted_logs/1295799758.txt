0:26:01	jonnypondwater	wtf is he pressing J im lost
0:26:05	Puddin_Wing	yup. You have to sync your mouse strafes with alternating A and D, if you don't you lose speed instead of gaining it @xKimper

3:23:11	user_name_pass_word_	i was trying to explain the giant tins of popcorn that materialize around the holidays to a non-american, they didn't understand why the tins were so big and why we would buy them if they go stale before you can finish it
3:23:13	Morde24	also fancy popcorn is OP but too calorie dense to enjoy consistently
3:23:14	zoofuu_	Garetts popcorn in Chicago

3:24:06	skyeCS_	@skyeCS_ I'd rather play all the maps than the regular safe bets D2, mirage that people seem to pick over the other maps... can be frustrating to say the least
