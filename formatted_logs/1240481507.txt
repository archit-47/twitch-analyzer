4:59:35	LowRatedHighlander	hey @fl0m, back in 2014 I was super depressed and I remember coming to your stream on new years and your vibes and stuff helped me get through a really bad time. I just heard a song that you played that night, and it reminded me of how far I came and how that small night helped me so much. Thanks a bunch, buddy.

5:13:49	SiestaKing_	So I'm an old guy learning PCs, what is tick rate?
5:14:11	LowRatedHighlander	tick rate is like the refresh rate of the server right?
5:14:17	z0roGG	@SiestaKing_ PROBABLY WRONG BUT ITS THE RATE AT WHICH THE SERVER RESPONDS
5:14:20	LowRatedHighlander	idk thats a bush question i feel like
5:14:21	TheRenegadeRonin	@SiestaKing_ the rate at which the server checks for changes in the game, like shots or key presses
5:14:28	Dynamo_Dave	how many times per sec the server updates
5:14:29	random_factz	@SiestaKing_ it's the thing I blame when I play bad
5:14:30	Floofys	In online games, a tick is an update between the server and the connected computers. Tick rate refers to how many times information is updated a second, usually measured in hertz. A 64-tick server will update info 64 times a second.

8:43:59	yobtih	This game is so fun actually
8:44:03	KamJam	man pubg so boring for real
8:44:06	Mazvydas	@Dynamo_Dave personally, not knowing anything, i'd go 500gb and faster, but just today I recommended the same wd green and a kingston a400 1tb xD for my grandma i slapped in a faster kingston 240gb its more than enough and squeezed a bunch of life out of an old laptop
8:44:07	DevWubb	fl0m you think my 2002 honda civic of a PC can run this?

8:44:25	yobtih	I think most PCs can run this
8:44:32	Bipolarbear_TV	its fun but I wish it didn't have that p2w shit in it
8:44:43	yobtih	It doesn‚Äôt have p2w
8:44:50	GFYMeowMix	@dweevers peepoGiggles trying to even remember why there was so much but i guess it was about right. couple short injury stoppages, goals and subs.
8:44:50	yobtih	The coins are in game currency you earn
8:44:52	Bolly	@Dynamo_Dave there's plenty of good 1TB SSD's around $100 (without sales)
8:44:55	apoodle10	pubg just felt like it was running on 4 tick servers
8:45:09	Bipolarbear_TV	I don't think i could earn them fast enough to play the characters I want to play
8:45:15	yobtih	Yes you can
8:45:16	you_ha_	streams rode PUBG ofr the views, more than they enjoyed it
8:45:18	KamJam	the looting in pubg too not a fan
8:45:21	Mazvydas	@Dynamo_Dave ya ya those models we're talking about are in the $100 range
8:45:35	KamJam	change stream key
8:45:38	Bipolarbear_TV	I also didn't get into the armory and other menus but it certainly reeked of p2w
8:45:51	yobtih	it‚Äôs not p2w at all
8:45:52	Dynamo_Dave	@mazvydas there's only the 1 m.2 slot available unfortunately. but I'll have a look at the 500gb ones and see if it works better for his laptop
8:46:00	KamJam	pubg was the h1z1 killer
