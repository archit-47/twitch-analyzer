4:32:40	yobtih	the pieces don't fit together, it will take them a year to make a dent into the top 15 and most new teams don't make it past the 1 year mark anyway so they will bomb

4:34:33	LowRatedHighlander	@thor_q np beautiful peepoPat
4:34:37	westnilekyle50	whats the command for thor???
4:34:55	Neo1010	size doesnt matter pog
4:34:58	westnilekyle50	@Thor_Q theres a command i just dont know it
4:35:09	Thor_Q	@westnilekyle50 someone already posted it for me
4:35:13	advanced510	xantares left the stability of what would be like Apple and went to a new start up, probably has the most to lose from this move
4:35:13	LowRatedHighlander	@westnilekyle50 if stream is skipping low latency can help
4:35:24	BH_Lithium	donations are like tips in the service industry

4:35:31	nigentaum	BOP
4:35:38	microbic__	@memory942 imo 500$ is a straight 500$ if its through streamlabs. Gifted subs takes 50%. so in straight money def 500, but in terms of community gifted subs
4:35:42	Thor_Q	@fl0m your mod LowRatedHighlander is S tier btw
4:35:46	westnilekyle50	@LowRatedHighlander i just couldnt remember the command to bring it up for him KEKW
4:35:54	Thor_Q	ty again chat <3
4:35:55	BH_Lithium	@microbic__ wrong, streamlabs takes a cut

4:36:07	microbic__	@BH_Lithium but not as much as twitch i assume
4:36:07	BH_Lithium	from 20‚Ç¨ donation, 18.80 goes through. calc from there
4:36:13	LowRatedHighlander	@westnilekyle50 I gotcha boo
4:36:15	prius_tv	@memory942 subs get more eyes on your channel though.  A dono is just one person.  100 gifted gets 100 potential people to see your channel
4:36:23	microbic__	@BH_Lithium thats way less than 50%
4:36:27	BH_Lithium	@microbic__ with twitch bits, the one donating pays the fee. With streamlabs, the streamer pays the fee
4:36:47	microbic__	@BH_Lithium true ig
4:37:27	Thor_Q	I could never live with myself if I took a tip I already gave back lol
4:37:35	westnilekyle50	@LowRatedHighlander again highratedHighlander bb Kissahomie
4:37:52	LowRatedHighlander	@westnilekyle50 thank you beautiful Kissahomie
4:37:57	BH_Lithium	twitch does offer slightly better fees compared to paypal
4:37:59	ekstral0ve	@Thor_Q some people can and you cant change them
4:38:00	sevinn	@fl0m its 180 days now :(

4:38:22	Terminat0r44	why the hell would someone do that peepoAngy
4:38:24	Gittawat_	what kind of ppl make you do that WTF
4:38:25	Matomoto	fees are 25 cents + 2% right
4:38:33	aetherealphoenix	shitty people @Gittawat_
4:38:43	JakeHart	i guess people just do that because they want to have their streamer love them and give them attention even though they dont want to actually spend the money?
4:38:51	BH_Lithium	2.9% and $0.30
4:38:54	DullaTPG	wait the new turkish team starts in advanced and scales up?
4:38:55	dataquest	yerr
4:38:57	yobtih	I don't understand how you can call this a super team where every person is past their prime and the only person who wasn't dropped from a T1 org was xantarees
4:38:57	SlickZkilleR	they recently updated paypal fees for smaller transactions but its negligible on bigger donos

4:39:15	td_gg	can you turn off donos and just take bits?
4:39:18	SoporificPanda	that is why i only ever donate in $2 increments. i'm going to accumulate enough $2 donos that when i charge them all back fl0m has no choice but to reinstall the closet
4:39:39	The_Ganznoob	Panda KEKPOINT
4:39:42	devanb97	Genuine question for somebody in chat/Fl0m, just got a new PC and for some reason my CSGO runs at 30fps now, Any ideas how to fix this? Vsync isn‚Äôt on, there‚Äôs no frame cap set, I‚Äôve uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothings working
4:39:44	SlickZkilleR	so bits are better PepoG
4:39:46	ShrapTy	@yobtih there will be hype around it if you call it a super team. Thats all that matters
4:39:48	advanced510	you should know by now that any new team that is called  "superteam" is just for hype LUL cmon now

4:40:06	aetherealphoenix	what about your gpu hardware settings? @devanb97
4:40:08	devanb97	@bh_lithium they‚Äôre up to date
4:40:11	advanced510	unless you brand new KEKW
4:40:13	kagiiiii	@devanb97 like a steady 30 fps?
4:40:29	dataquest	fl0mG
4:40:33	aetherealphoenix	take a look in your graphics card control panel @devanb97
4:40:43	devanb97	@kagiiiii yeah it just sits at 30, I have a 3050RTX and it‚Äôs only CS every other game runs perfectly fine
4:40:43	amutantcookie	the online era of cs doesn't count
4:40:44	LowRatedHighlander	Yeah idk about woxic he didn‚Äôt really drop from a T1 org
4:40:45	yobtih	is he going to move?
4:40:48	advanced510	woxic had a top tier contract too
4:40:51	ekstral0ve	calyx was individually decent wihtin envy
4:40:55	BH_Lithium	@devanb97 fullscreen gaming, not having potato cpu
4:40:57	yobtih	are they going to be in turkey? cause that will still be a problem
4:41:10	ekstral0ve	imorr is a beast of an aimer
4:41:13	kagiiiii	@devanb97 check the nvidia control panel, maybe it's forcing a 30 fps cap through there?
4:41:22	amutantcookie	Both teams in valorant dc'd from a VCT match earlier in turkey KEKW
4:41:26	pz1k4	!headset
4:41:27	Nightbot	fl0m's peripherals and other gear are here: https://pastebin.com/rBv4ck0G
4:41:31	devanb97	@kagiiiii I‚Äôm at work rn so I can‚Äôt but when I looked before nothing was capped even through the control panel
4:41:41	ekstral0ve	issaa had similar problems as woxic I think
4:42:08	darkxlord21	tarik not in turkish superteam feelsadman
4:42:09	keetnawilson13	how long until they qualify for a studio event?
4:42:12	keetnawilson13	few years?
4:42:15	kagiiiii	@devanb97 That's really bizarre, I'd check again just to be sure but sorry I can't help more man. Make sure the fps cap and vsync are both off
4:42:15	devanb97	I can play literally everything else perfectly fine it‚Äôs only CS which makes no sense to me, I‚Äôve dropped the settings as low as they can go and it‚Äôs still sitting at 30 just to see if that was the issue for whatever reason
4:42:18	ShrapTy	is turkey just in a bad spot geographically for good internet to other countries?
4:42:30	aetherealphoenix	i mean only other thing i can think of is cpu multithreading maybe @devanb97
4:42:37	amutantcookie	No just far from western europe ShrapTy
4:42:47	ShrapTy	@amutantcookie ahhh that makes sense
4:42:54	waterbottle749	Vac
4:43:01	ekstral0ve	an asian team recently moved to Turkey for a year to compete in EU tourneys. the team is D13
4:43:06	advanced510	that's just cause the roster for c9 wasn't truly thought out KEKW

4:43:36	yobtih	I'd love to be wrong but my analysis is a bomb out about a year in
4:43:51	yobtih	or a shuffle of different players
4:43:52	ShrapTy	@westnilekyle50 wait what
4:43:58	amutantcookie	wym devanb97
4:43:58	devanb97	@radgamer07 no I‚Äôve only kept it at native, usually play in 4:3 but idk why the native res would have me running at that FPS
4:44:02	keetnawilson13	i would agree with hitboy
4:44:09	keetnawilson13	the scene is too oversaturated rn
4:44:14	ShrapTy	@westnilekyle50 did they make roster changes?
4:44:15	cloutburstgg	VAC
4:44:16	ekstral0ve	@yobtih imagine they win a major and the team falls apart after..your analysis would still stand true
4:44:17	amutantcookie	I can't wait to see the big UK Boiz on Fnatic
4:44:21	westnilekyle50	@ShrapTy someone in chat said c9 picked up vanity

4:45:34	amutantcookie	I hope someone signs Smooya before he switches. Guys had no luck with teams PepeHands
4:45:44	DullaTPG	devanb97 i had a similiar problem with my rx570 which now has 200 fps used to get 40~, i dont remember everything i did was the sv_maxrate command, whih i remember helped
4:45:45	westnilekyle50	@ShrapTy whispered you ana rticle
4:45:47	chickenuggetz2	im so not caught up with this team drama
4:45:56	rdodge84	can you plz ask ur hot doge to stop staring into my soul @fl0m
4:45:58	cloutburstgg	@amutantcookie lots of people say his toxicity is an issue but im pretty sure he has a grip on it now
4:46:02	ekstral0ve	I think the problem for them would be mostly regarding player ego and the space they require.
4:46:05	cloutburstgg	he's a fantastic awper to watch
4:46:22	amutantcookie	cloutburstgg that's what I've heard too. Literal clutch master and nasty with an awp or pistol
