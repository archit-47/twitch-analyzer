2:01:31	ShreddedCheeks	Hey guys, Had a tough day on CSGO. Four losses in a row because of toxic team mates, queued one last time and was happy to see that fl0m was on my team. With it being Vertigo, I was happy to have a good awper on my team - and having followed him for so many years it was gonna be great to play with him. When the game started he immediately disconnected, and we got pounded. Ended up abandoning after 7 rounds and I deranked. Is this normal?
