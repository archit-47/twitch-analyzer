0:36:19	FideleirAA	gaulesBr

0:36:22	hynzx_	Stewir demon mode
0:36:28	xohl	fair point

0:48:50	smmuny	same
0:49:00	Bobbytux1	They get paid to stagnate nowadays its sad.
0:49:02	slb_	@doccy more like Bobby being spicy
0:49:11	IslamMakachev	Valorant isn't a good spectator sport imho

0:52:32	TestTubeBaba	@bobbytux1 Pro cs has always been with the least amount of changes, mostly community run. Valve barely interferes in anything
0:52:35	IslamMakachev	What do you think Shox provides to Liquid? I think his fragging is too low

1:22:18	0ShadowRaze	People will always find a way to hate on someone. I thought the part with Grim was kinda harsh, but again I don't know the behind the scenes problems, so I don't judge. I just know changes are inevitable and I just hope TL can bounce back in the next year. Being a Liquid fan is hard :(

1:22:31	csgomunchin	Yeah buddy that’s true
1:22:48	nareshkatra	many people are blaming stew cause he bottom frags in many games , is it justified and if not what else does he bring to the team @fl0m
1:22:48	vchair23	no different then the c9 salary stuff, people want to know, but they don't want to know directly because then it alters their thinking

1:23:15	Wirth18	@vchair23 +++
1:23:15	Bobbytux1	stew has always been picked on.
1:23:44	le_petit_phrog	Stew should just switch to valorant NRG and let his career die along with s0m

1:23:54	Flounder3345	he gave grim tons of credit, even
1:23:57	Komodochainz	if you see team liquid's vlog, stew's calls and utilities plays a big part
1:23:58	justiey	stew even gave him his respect in the article so idk what pple are talking about
1:23:58	TestTubeBaba	@le_petit_phrog ruthless xD
1:24:02	so4pybox	people hating on stew but he said it how it is and really thats all he could do it will be helpful in the future for everyone in liquid especially grim
1:24:06	b0btheman_	yo fl0m how are you

1:24:10	Speedrulez	workrate is the most important trait in professional careers. that is why i took that away fl0m
1:24:13	apoodle10	stew is one of those guys that shoulders a lot of responsibility and is willing to do so; and that generally leads to more people finding some sort of issue with him
1:24:15	dj0nk	to be fair though he did grim kind of dirty by saying grim doesnt work hard enough
1:24:16	akZei	elige cant agree with anyone
1:24:17	eppsy99	Stew was picked on for stating valid facts and inside information
1:24:18	apoodle10	at least that's my impression
1:24:28	V1ZzxX	what about naf
1:24:29	le_petit_phrog	@smmuny on what, my c0ck?

1:24:42	Justhoohaa	Stewie didn't trash him. he basically said he had to learn all new roles because grim and elige have similar roles . at least that's what I got from it
1:24:43	vchair23	naf is the most interesting piece of the entire deal , the least clear
1:24:54	nanerpus_	Maybe Grim doesnt work hard enough?
1:24:54	justiey	@Justhoohaa facts hoohoo
1:25:06	jgrasp_	@v1zzxx we all know NAF is chill and will do whatever the team needs him to
1:25:08	y0banana	Mr Papa Salami, the smartest man alive
1:25:10	tirooler	@dj0nk If you feel that way that's not doing him dirty, honesty is the best policy in these cases always I think
1:25:14	harryparadise	did they just pick maps they could just pug play KEKW
1:25:14	greenteasake	IMO, Liquid would have benefitted from a team counselor or psychologist like NAVI has. I read that article and was more concerned with their mental health.

1:25:26	AnnoyinMercenary	@fl0m people keep twisting the language but it's very important, he said he could've worked harder, not that he didn't work hard enough, there's a difference

1:25:37	skylo_y	@greenteasake they do have one
1:25:39	yalebgg	I think the only thing stew said that could even slightly be taken offensive to gr1m is calling him a slow learner

1:27:20	1Zhhzh	i just dont feel grim has much to do with the situation
1:27:35	hyperstef	grim is just collateral damage Sadge
1:27:36	Madfish2021	with what people have said about Elige maybe he is the underlying problem?
1:27:40	hobrev	he also said that Grim joined at a very bad timing

1:27:42	tirooler	he also says he feels Grim was put in an unfair position cause he was thrust into a struggling team and taking over roles he never played

3:49:51	LucidR9	YogJr you can go the other way
3:49:53	FLiGHTcs	that push alone makes sense at a higher level. many times you can catch out underpass guy from conn and leave through the smoke
3:49:53	walli_cs	olof just got his head ripped off every round on short it was unlucky
3:49:55	toastisalie	fl0m do you gamble a lot in vegas?

3:51:48	Mentalstatemike	wall stuck
3:52:03	LucidR9	Mentalstatemike you shut your cute ass mouth
3:52:12	guzszsz	too risky in round 30 in my opinion
3:52:20	hobrev	good play, bad luck on this particular round
3:52:26	Mentalstatemike	@lucidr9 okee MmmHmm
3:52:32	LucidR9	Mentalstatemike I SAID SHUT

3:52:44	elemzee_	its rain flash that blinds olof that kills the round
3:52:45	lurei3107	did you expect heroic to win mirage flom?
3:52:46	trikzjumper_	it was abit aggressive peek for clearing it rather do it more safe and play top co
3:52:51	crocswsocks	Mentalstatemike i've always been curious about your name. there a story behind it?

3:52:56	LucidR9	THe future pros in twitch chat are going wild
3:52:56	silver_eyes_tempest9	How long has mirage been out and they still haven’t smoothed out the wall hit boxes
3:53:01	tzinga7	i think getting stuck was unlucky
3:53:01	marshan307	the moment he decided play infront of the molly.. I feel he had to commit to a play.. like pushed stavn maybe..
3:53:12	dbleday	I love Faze calling but they don't always technically follow threw on skills in the moment
3:53:15	lurei3107	who do you think gonna win nuke next flom? faze or heroic?

3:53:24	elemzee_	olof is short and gets team flashed as they cross

3:54:05	trikzjumper_	might not have to clear it.. i know he wanted some information but going somewhere alone in last round without anyone able to trade.. high risk gamble
3:54:06	LucidR9	it's happening
3:54:10	Uh_Kevin	I will accept not slander in chat about the beautiful man named Olof.
3:54:15	kachows	@fl0m If Faze would replace rain and olof who would genuine upgrades be?

3:54:38	two_drop	Focus less on Twistzz play and more on how well Heroic executed. They forced a decision.
3:54:39	nams39	TL sucks
3:54:45	random_factz	Actually you should stay if dealer has 7, 8, 9
3:54:46	ninetyfivemonkeys	@toastisalie legally, yes

4:55:12	matty_phresh	It’s been long time since faze clan played good. Karrigan is not smart, I thought he smart but he ain’t. Just throwing like champ, rain can only get eco kills and some deagle shots. Broky is the only good player, Olof good player but old, now play bad is normal, nothing to complain about it. Twistzz is also good but getting not good day by day.
4:55:13	TheLeviathong	Faze with Ropz is definitely stacked, but it feels like the set up to once again bench Karrigan because his stats will be bad LUL
4:55:13	m0FFFFF	what a unit that man

5:32:29	MyNameisKIP	@kabiraspeakingg its situational the one tap headshot is still stupid good with the ak but the m4 is less punishing if you have worse aim
5:32:31	SupraUK_	nice shot SeemsGood
5:32:32	cloutburstgg	but dont u think liquid's success in 2019 was more because of their individual skill and stewie's entry fragging rather than nitr0's IGL abilities? @fl0m

5:38:32	GreenPhoenix044	When will 128 tick be normal tho? Cuz it would be way better for everyone
5:38:39	5Rule_	@andrewmedaTV sooo does that mean naf, stew, fallen will be a part of a new roster?
5:38:42	NEOX99	Get_right's streams are great, but I prefer to watch him on the server ngl
5:38:42	vrajio	@fl0m why would liquid be dropping naf i thought he was decent as per hltv report
5:38:45	BooKasper	My biggest issue with CS is that its almost a decade old. Gets harder to attract newer people/viewers over time. That and basic quality of life things that are standard now in most games
5:38:47	lonewulf2004	@andrewmedaTV got you bud
5:38:49	two_drop	what ever happened to the twitch boosting thing? is that still gonna happen?
5:38:49	Gearslayer360	@fl0m yea mm is balls if you dont use faceit
5:38:51	OGfeb	@rushil_20 keep hearing about this source 2 for years now. Wtf is it
5:39:03	crypt1ci_i	dude electronic hasnt died still @fl0m
5:39:04	sanchit47	what do you think about naf to FaZe @fl0m

5:39:25	hokieboy01	monkaW staff
5:39:26	rushil_20	@OGfeb honestly dota was coded years ago i don't get how cs isn't ported to source 2 yet
5:39:26	rrroverrr	It is fine in EU
5:39:26	quantarel1	The fact that we have to use 3rd party mm just to enjoy casual s is rlly bad
5:39:27	loldia1337	i only play mm and i enjoy the f outta it xd
5:39:28	easternexamination	As an eSport, Counter Strike works really well. I play Valorant but it's just not fun to watch Valorant matches.
5:39:32	jrsprinks	as someone who is just getting into cs it is really difficult to get into from a user interface, matchmaking, and ease of use standpoint
5:39:34	a732v	the short match update really improved the casual experience imo

5:39:39	salmonknight2	GabeN shame?
5:39:42	Judze	@fl0m have you seen rumours that Nitr0 to Liquid is close to a done deal?
5:39:44	BuSheeZy	the casual casual players are fucked. they are trying to queue gun game/flying scoutsman on MM and the whole server is filled with cheaters/bots, lol

5:40:19	Kurintoi	what is they doing?
5:40:22	slb_	@OGfeb at one point they said that its easier to just make another cs than to port cs to source 2 because of the doodoo coding

5:40:57	Huwaidee	@fl0m if you were valve would you introduce csgo 2 or would you slowly integrate source 2 to the game ?
5:40:58	jrsprinks	I agree completely
5:41:00	shmoked_meat	Americano is gangster.
5:41:04	arureus	electronic hasn't died yet?

5:41:58	Nightbot	No, Shut up.
5:41:58	crypt1ci_i	an updated engine maybe @fl0m

5:42:04	shmoked_meat	There’s no business case for a new game
5:42:04	TyphloMusic	yea i can see like 5 more years of CSGO, maybe 10, every game rips off valve

5:42:20	BooKasper	From a dev perspective, it might be worth it to just release a new one on their new engine, since maintaining the existing game and modernizing it is too much work
5:42:21	priiide_	apex is lit
5:42:22	mr0afish	TRUE
5:42:24	SoporificPanda	thecountdooku csgo pretty big in denmark. maybe a little bit odd, but probably small advertising spend for a company like maersk. i don't think lego would sponsor this because of the game content

5:42:56	Off1ine__	any game thats been out for 10 years with constant updates is going to be spaghetti code
5:42:58	mataza94	i just think they can redo the spaghetti code so it is easier to maintain/update
5:42:59	two_drop	CS needs a FaceIt level base anticheat (not Valorant level) and some lifestyle updates. Don't need to flip the whole script.

5:43:40	goodvibesoldier	11 is all they get
5:43:44	BooKasper	Isn't it two different probs to solve though? One issue is the gameplay/QoL, and the other issue is attracting new viewers? Both are big issues imo.
5:43:46	andrewmedaTV	@lonewulf2004 there is very little chance Kenny stays on this team. And is M0nesy joins, he takes Amanek's spot as AWP. I think they should also be looking at a replacment for Jackz, which I believe they are. Not sure who yet
5:43:48	priiide_	B OOOO MBL

5:44:58	thecountdooku	@SoporificPanda Got it. I think I find it odd since it would be the equivalent of seeing CGM sponsoring a French CSGO tournament or COSCO Shipping for a Chinese tournament. Then again, I am talking about Maersk so I guess their sponsorship is working?

5:58:30	Prodigy_bc	do u see autimatic coming back?
5:58:32	so4pybox	Do you think Liquid would ever drop EliGE or would they wait until he is done with them until they let him go
5:58:33	YogJr	Sryson can’t use a rifle but at least he can use a scout

5:58:46	uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh	I'm the answer :)
5:58:46	Diaz1	Feels like big needs to make at least 2 changes
5:58:48	samson36000	i think the best thing liquid could do is remove fallen and grim and get shox and nitr0
5:58:49	Thermophobe	gade should focus on being a fortnite streamer as he used to be
5:58:50	TheLeviathong	BIG won the last time they played btw
5:58:50	kabiraspeakingg	@TestTubeBaba PepeLaugh PepeLaugh PepeLaugh
5:58:50	rushil_20	when do we see na orgs entering cs back probably 6 months @fl0m
5:58:53	masterjohn2	shox is fine on liquid, but VINI? seriously bro. not the answer
5:59:06	slb_	sprout has the interesting players tied to like 5 year contracts
5:59:08	0nze0	Is there a future for ChrisJ?
5:59:11	V1ZzxX	@masterjohn2 i dont even see shox in liquid
5:59:14	ShaawAU	him and stew are also good friends, they probably want to stick together
5:59:15	Thermophobe	the odds rn sheeeesh
5:59:16	sevegonzo	These odds are POGGERS
5:59:20	TestTubeBaba	Big Faven would have been so good
5:59:23	d0ughtyy	Why do teams keep letting Navi play nuke
5:59:27	V1ZzxX	shox role will clash with grim's wont it
5:59:32	Volrin9	Do you think C9 will pick up C Flames?
5:59:33	nifonz	i feel like a big reason cis is so good is cause they all speak russian
5:59:33	nanerpus_	I mean, the common thread in people leaving liquid over the years has been Elige. Its possible NAF doesnt want to play with him
5:59:38	TheLeviathong	So liquid will be Elige, Nitro, Shox, ?, ?
5:59:39	sarvmiester	@fl0m hltv just put on their insta about nitro joining LIQUID again
5:59:41	Uwotm08	@d0ughtyy you can't ban them all during map-picking phase
5:59:43	quantarel1	I never agreed that they could replace xantares's firepower
5:59:46	so4pybox	I dont think shox on liquid is a good idea
5:59:53	Iram38	FL0m did you see the nitr0 article on hltv?
5:59:53	vzylexy	Force them to play Vertigo
5:59:55	Prodigy_bc	do u see autimatic coming back?

6:00:00	PimentacoCS	Season
6:00:00	tan_clips	i feel like not nuke
6:00:04	Gearslayer360	overpass? maybe your best shot
6:00:05	coneboy01	If more orgs come back to CS, do some of the pros that went to Valorant potentially move back?
6:00:06	21jayj	nitr0 shox and vini, the firepower will be a big issue for lliquid to break into top 10
6:00:07	ValdemarY	Vertigo Pog
6:00:07	legoooooo_	dust 2 was a bad pick against navi literally one of their best maps

6:04:46	Speedrulez	dweevers my mundo and kaisa were also very very important, but that early cho man... it is just too good
6:04:49	DashX239	I think the shox move is bait honestly
6:04:49	slb_	i dont think osee would even leave es
6:04:52	cosmic_sasquatch	maybe -shox +obo?
6:04:52	dweevers	supra_nightmare sadgeBusinessTime most of the day for me :(
6:04:53	vinciCS	JayMehta29 Stew probably wanted to leave moreso than Liquid removing him
6:04:53	GreenPhoenix044	KennyS to liquid maybe then?
6:04:54	Mentalstatemike	shox is the main op-er now
6:04:55	AMutantCookie	Junior would be POGGERS
6:04:57	YogJr	Nitro was awping in pugs
6:04:58	KNAPKINAT0R	I think shot is stew replacement as the team hype
6:05:00	maybemystic	CerQ
6:05:00	Madfish2021	@JayMehta29 they arent removing him he is leaving
6:05:02	LowRatedHighlander	I don’t like the shox pick ether Sadge
6:05:03	SoporificPanda	the thing that i do like about this roster is that liquid will continue to lose a lot of matches, in that way it will feel very comfortable for me as a liquid fan
6:05:04	dweevers	Speedrulez did you make a range 2 cho again? KEKW
6:05:04	JayMehta29	@vinciCS oooh :(

6:05:53	Speedrulez	dweevers no KEKW didnt get any bows. i gave him one defensive item, an item that allowed to crit his magical attacks and an item that healed him for 33% of magic attacks
6:05:53	rushil_20	honestly if they are getting shox why not just try getting bubzski @fl0m
6:05:59	kingkwaku_	what do you think of Kenny subbing I'm or nexa
6:06:01	Thugs_Bunny268	double poney?
6:06:04	silver_eyes_tempest9	Would they say awper for nitr0 i mean he is an awper but wouldn’t they say another IGL for nitr0
6:06:05	Zorik13	this team looks uninspired
6:06:12	dweevers	Speedrulez that seems broken
6:06:13	tirooler	if shox takes a break now, he'd be done I think
6:06:14	LowRatedHighlander	KennyS has a huge contract that’s a massive commitment
6:06:19	DashX239	I feel like shox's english might not be solid enough
6:06:22	Speedrulez	dweevers so he didnt took that much damage, and every ult healed him for a ton
6:06:22	LowRatedHighlander	Gotta buy that out
6:06:23	dev1ce_56	@fl0m awper for liquid ????
6:06:23	blackburn786786	he need to back in his form like old days

6:06:49	GreenPhoenix044	Ill give shox 4 months on liquid

6:06:54	Huwaidee	@jhsgod washed tbh
6:06:57	Speedrulez	and a casual kaisa 1 that did like 10k damage dweevers ...
6:07:03	a732v	pwn > Shox
6:07:06	Phi0_	They've placed second twice
6:07:06	LowRatedHighlander	@madfish2021 I’m not sure but I assume it’s still a big amount of money, I could be wrong though.
6:07:08	Semiproshark7	all because faze threw
6:07:11	BobiHouzmeister	KEKW
6:07:11	ritzii_	i just hope liquid doesn't turn into another c9 where they cycle through past their prime european players ad nauseum
6:07:11	nanerpus_	That team just sounds not great
6:07:14	mukulhayaran	based
6:07:14	Speedrulez	that unit with some stacked items is utterly broken dweevers
6:07:16	V1ZzxX	as a team i think stew and naf shouldn't leave
6:07:20	buzzy_daddy	they could be
6:07:23	JayMehta29	@JayMehta29 but the only way he gets experience is if he stays in TL, he has been performing no doubt
6:07:24	madmedo2	fl0m to liquid
6:07:25	jockst3r	i mean sure but there is a first time for everything, for a long time you could say the same about NA

6:07:38	LowRatedHighlander	@madfish2021 from how fl0m has talked about it with Kenny and stuff it sounds like a large amount
6:07:40	mukulhayaran	%? 69
6:07:40	Nightbot	Joris says 32%
6:07:40	V1ZzxX	liquid should remove fallen and grim

6:07:55	a732v	Adren player-coach
6:07:59	gt_mango	for shox cmon
6:08:00	Speedrulez	i think it is so good, that whatever comp you are building, if you see a kaisa, you change your comp to build around that unit dweevers
6:08:02	Zorik13	i think naf is leaving
6:08:03	bolottekid	@fl0m or shox goes to NA to lift the scene and carry us on his back COPIUM
6:08:03	gt_mango	why
6:08:03	blackburn786786	the better the roster looks the worse it performs
6:08:04	V1ZzxX	and what about that fallen and cold brazillian superteam
6:08:04	h0ax_7419	why DROP stewie2k?

6:08:42	0atneil	@fl0m wot happened with liquid ?
6:08:45	Madfish2021	@LowRatedHighlander yea good point it would be a big risk
6:08:45	DashX239	Maybe naf and tarik OpTic rerun??
6:08:46	Kraken_Lord	@utkarshjr7 naf faze?
6:08:46	ShaawAU	NAF wants to stick with stew i reckon
6:08:48	JaYaJ	HE WANTS TO LEAVE TO PLAY WITH STEW
6:08:49	Dinger111	Wasnt there rumors of Naf wanting to link up with the EG guys a year or so ago. Something about them being close
6:08:49	stockus	Wonder if it's mostly because they never got to build the team how they wanted. Stew's interview re: grim seemed to indicate with grim and fallen they weren't getting the team they wanted.
6:08:50	JaYaJ	FFS
6:08:51	LowRatedHighlander	@kian_dn refresh gamba is still up
6:08:52	kian_dn	modCheck
6:08:54	Zorik13	@UtkarshJr7 he moves to eg. how is that make sense?
6:08:56	dreamshadow0	who was it that was having role clash in liquid @fl0m ?
6:08:56	joey06lol	what happened to stew and fallen?
6:08:57	cosmic_sasquatch	tarik aint coming back imo
6:09:01	JayMehta29	@fl0m whats the new vitality roster looking like? like whos in there?
6:09:02	jwoolymammoth	@fl0m is stew really a problem for liquid?

6:09:04	Thugs_Bunny268	one of these questionable moves is going to succed
6:09:05	sarvmiester	Fk it just get the big guns tell pasha to come to NA @fl0m
6:09:05	maybemystic	what time tomorrow?
6:09:06	Mentalstatemike	im rooting for where ever stew goes
6:09:08	McBubba03	BIG COPIUM
6:09:10	greenteasake	NAF: 1385  Days in current team  3, basically 4 years
6:09:11	apoodle10	when it comes to ping etc, routing is more important than up / down speeds, you should be fine beertjhe1234
6:09:14	JuiceW4H	I`ll talk to fl0m after I`ll get him to join navi. Navi had been knocking on fl0m`s door for a while now.
6:09:15	TheDojoe	EG roster intriguing now stew and NAF :)
6:09:19	Fofandi	I have been thinking about this for a minute and I get that elite has a lot of say but they need to drop him. Like I love the guy but even if you take things back to the earlier days, the problems some of the times revolved around him not getting along with other people. I feel like the current roster with dropping elige and bringing in a new talent would work well
6:09:24	rushil_20	honestly if they are getting shox why not just try getting bubzski @fl0m
6:09:28	CarrotHair_TV	Who do you think replaces VINNI ON FURIA
6:09:32	UtkarshJr7	@Zorik13 Naf to EG NOPERS It makes no sense
6:09:33	McBubba03	KEKW
6:09:33	TheLeviathong	Only Astralis, Gambit, Vitality and G2 (with awper) are capable of challenging Navi atm I think
6:09:34	apoodle10	since you can't really influence the routing of your internet service provider beertjhe1234
6:09:36	mukulhayaran	KEKW
6:09:40	kallek	put tape on headset, this is not the same :(

6:09:55	BigWit12	ENVY/Optic takes their gigabag from the  Valorant Champions skin and reenters CS?
6:09:56	pedeso	were they not happy with liquid?
6:09:57	sir_atlas10	elige is the best player in that team man. pretty sure he isn't the problem.
6:09:57	TestTubeBaba	LUL
6:09:58	mukulhayaran	BOOBA SeriousSloth
6:10:02	JayMehta29	@fl0m whos in the new vitality roster?
6:10:02	McBubba03	@LowRatedHighlander it's gonna fucking suck if he actually leaves Sadge
6:10:04	the_scrash	stew and naf probably had the best relationship on that roster, so im guessing naf wants to play with him
6:10:07	Speedrulez	BOOBA
6:10:12	TestTubeBaba	@fl0m NAF and flusha together Pog Kappa
6:10:15	rushil_20	@Speedrulez well with the astralis liquid beef they probably also will oversell
6:10:18	LowRatedHighlander	According to stews reports it’s a conflict of ideals between stew elige and fallen
6:10:18	abhi007bond	BOOBA
6:10:19	kallek	tape on headset is the new shoe on head
6:10:23	JuiceW4H	Letting go of Dupreeh is bad for astralis dup was carrying them through games.

7:38:32	blacktron1x	"Your aim is insane." BlameF said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Konfig's pants and smirked. "Are you trying to spray me?" protests Konfig, as BlameF blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Konfig. "Weak ass eco play, BlameF." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Konfig dropped his StatTrak™ AWP | Asiimov (Field-Tested) into BlameF's open bombsite

9:42:11	sacmann	I can't believe that there was a team with K0nfig, Valde, and MSL and they never won anything.
9:42:18	LowRatedHighlander	Astralis left mirage up because they knew they were gonna 2-0 peepoFoil

9:42:27	jayes843	@fl0m maybe they are trying rifle lucky?
9:42:27	CrovvCSGO	Do you think Acor would fit. he has a decently aggro awping style i think would fit the new roster
9:42:28	Aqueilas_tv	Who do you replace Lucky with then? Best Danish players are already on other teams. Copenhagen flames player?
9:42:28	Cuddle_Dickins	he will prob enrty

9:43:46	td_gg	Acor is way too volatile of an awper
9:43:54	CrovvCSGO	@fl0m I agree.
9:43:57	kallek	they brought him up too fast
