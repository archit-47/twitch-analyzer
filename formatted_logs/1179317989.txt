2:12:27	cyanideaddict_	this a wrap it seems
2:12:28	Dameey_	do you think there's an argument for really good aimers, who play lots of anchor positions, to use the a4? b1t for example, extra bullets and 70% of his kills are hs anyway ie faster with a4
2:12:29	hobrev	dont forget the part where Riot simply forgot to arrange the trips and hotels for AU participants
2:12:30	johnny_legless	G'Day Fl0m, how ya doing chat?

2:13:55	dr_theory	PUBG pros are happy with 70fps KEKW
2:13:56	tedfa	*cries into my shitty gpu*
2:13:57	hobrev	it would be like showing up to a lan event with 60hz monitors
2:14:06	Tank_Melts	@fl0m do you think it’s worth getting a 360 hz monitor since I get 399+ for in cs or should I just stay with a 240hz
2:14:08	ElaD_O	my PC gets 180 on valorant with 1440 and it's nothing special, what kind of pcs did they use?
