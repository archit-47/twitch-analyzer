0:52:47	SupraUK_	yeah the image processing on new phones is insane
0:52:48	BSODslayer	It's adaptive 120hz, when it's needed, then all the way down to i think, 10 or 15 when image is static to save battery... Pretty clever, whatever the apple haters say... ^^

0:53:25	andrewmedaTV	!936p @Audrix13
0:53:25	Nightbot	936p provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown; however, it was causing issues with fl0m's resolution, so he switched to 1080p.
0:53:26	Not_Grahm	What's your res for streaming? I thought it was 960x50
0:53:26	ChaoticRenny	more steelseries product shots @fl0m ?
0:53:27	brazzerschris	good morning fl OMEGALUL m <3
0:53:34	Not_Grahm	oh
0:53:35	steelarm77	!encoder
0:53:35	Not_Grahm	nvm
0:53:35	Nightbot	H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)

1:36:23	tirooler	@Mangoyusi yeah if you talk about the most valuable player for his team you're right, it's just not how MVPs are given out historically
1:36:24	LowRatedHighlander	It would be so weird if they gave it to a losing team although I agree niko would have deserved it

1:37:47	oTTV_BTW	I feel like safely this is the new norm
1:37:51	RegentZoran	@fl0m Do you think some kind of a league could reinvigorate the NA (maybe +SA) region? Something like in afk sports, weekly round-robin system, with playoffs, like in NBA? With sponsors, casters, pre and postmatch interviews, commercials and everything? Or is CSGO fading in NA?

2:02:19	siDDziy	How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a "bomb"? Instead of abilities they have "nades mollies and smokes". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this

4:13:34	sevengaming_tv	How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a "bomb"? Instead of abilities they have "nades mollies and smokes". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this

Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this

4:43:34	Yatse	@fl0m IMO yes but it takes bit to have a bad day
4:43:35	siiiif	whitecoffeegaming peepoIQ Clap

4:43:37	elblanco744	NOPERS
4:43:37	cutebatmann	liquid beat navi
4:43:37	PerhapsItsPeach	if liquid can beat navi any top 700 team can beat navi
4:43:38	sevengaming_tv	who is navi? modCheck
4:43:38	kachows	N OMEGALUL
4:43:41	guckmalnachhinten_	NAVI is not close to what Astralis were tbh
4:43:41	Jam1eXT	not likely ngl
4:43:44	sealxteam6	the new version doesn't either lol
4:43:46	huronvalley21	The way NaVi looked yes they will beat them
4:43:48	mellerby604	Who’s map pick?
4:43:49	andrejkee20101	NOPERS
4:43:49	warrior__ftw	no only current liquid
4:43:51	s1mply_ant	G2 and maybe liquid now, in a few months its a diff story
4:43:51	Yatse	god no
4:43:53	FlameyKumori	@FlameyKumori just cause they do shotguns good doesn't mean they do everything else good.
4:43:53	coaboof	chat silly
4:43:55	uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh	They need me :)
4:43:56	sevengaming_tv	KEKPOINT navi
4:44:01	stockus	Does Navi stay on form too. But not a good bet to make for your roster
4:44:03	TheLeviathong	Maybe with -Kyojin though, and satying French
4:44:03	MANIKcc	I don't think so, but at the same time I don't think you can say it gave it enough time given how much they have improved.
4:44:05	whitecoffeegaming	yeah Im trash ok
4:44:06	lategamer3	But can Navi beat Goku?
4:44:08	SukksGaming	@johnny_legless stairs by ct spawn, just outside hell is called zywoo

4:44:19	johnny_legless	@SukksGaming Awesome, thank you!
4:44:20	Yatse	but going international is not going to fix it tho
4:44:21	raisinbranistasty	You know who does beat the navi roster? Liquid.
4:44:24	steelarm77	@FlameyKumori but shotguns in val, esp judge are so good bordering on broken
4:44:25	yourducky	council HmmCouncil
4:44:30	l3ordon	Vitality should just get s1mple and niko, its honestly pretty easy
4:44:30	guscantsleep	Neither does adding dupreeh who is washed and magisk and then having to comm in English
4:44:30	s1mply_ant	The only team that can beat NaVi is NaVi themselves
4:44:32	andrejkee20101	@lategamer3 Na`Vi vs Goku Pog
4:44:32	LowRatedHighlander	HmmCouncil
4:44:33	yourducky	I call another meeting HmmCouncil
4:44:34	DavieWhy	@lategamer3 Find out next week!
4:44:36	rygaardhansen	Magisk is a clear upgrade for kyojin
4:44:40	yourducky	HmmCouncil https://7tv.app/emotes/60f5cf1ae57bec02160bde10
4:44:41	Jam1eXT	FAKE DISBAND???
4:44:42	RhinoIsSus	HmmCouncil
4:44:44	l3ordon	@s1mply_ant And liquid
4:44:45	ohmissyme	I agree @guscantsleep
4:44:47	gamer9627	tbh I dont think turning to eng comms is the answer to beat Navi
4:44:47	lategamer3	@lategamer3 on the next episode...
4:44:47	topperonthetop	Imagine saying Dupreeh is washed
4:44:48	SupraUK_	HmmCouncil
4:44:52	Jam1eXT	DISBANDING GIVE XTRA POWER
4:44:52	AnnoyinMercenary	If you play better after you learn your team is "dead" then they definitely need changes, cus they weren't reaching their potential
4:44:56	2020numbers	NOPERS HmmCouncil
4:44:57	LowRatedHighlander	HmmCouncil disapproves
4:44:58	ohmissyme	Or saying washed, but the language problem is for real
4:45:02	RhinoIsSus	D:
4:45:03	guckmalnachhinten_	to me NAVI is overrated af compared to Astralis
4:45:03	Yatse	I think Kyojin can be just like how misutaa is now
4:45:04	ohmissyme	Not saying ****
4:45:04	SupraUK_	that will get lost in the resize imo
4:45:05	alexis809s	bring back Le tank Sadge
4:45:06	siiiif	NOPERS
4:45:06	MANIKcc	in the long-run developing someone like kyojin may pan out better than acquiring someone new, it's undoubtedly a knee-jerk reaction move
4:45:09	siDDziy	imo getting reeh and magisk would be wrong
4:45:09	PattarTheMastar	I was really hoping that vitality would pick up amanek or some dblponey guys
4:45:10	yourducky	I have one more council HmmCouncil
4:45:12	destinction13	fl0m do you think Apex and Zonic will be Pinky and The Brain of CS?
4:45:17	LowRatedHighlander	HmmCouncil
4:45:18	rygaardhansen	And I think it is going to be fun to see Apex and Dupreeh entry together
4:45:20	l3ordon	I think vitality just picks up s1mple and niko and theyll be fine, its a pretty easy solution actually @fl0m
4:45:20	RhinoIsSus	HmmCouncil
4:45:21	whitecoffeegaming	When I grow up to own microsoft (Dont argue chat) I will just use way more money than anyone else and get all the best players in the world by far

5:29:38	supra_nightmare	if i was lucky, i would ask to leave honestly. its an insult at this point
5:29:40	audio_noodle	@fl0m i didn't mean that lol, i was just wondering why they are running a double awp, when clearly the players using awps don't look comfortable with them
5:29:40	OwlBoHoe	yeah then lucky should awp
5:29:42	s1mply_ant	I just wish we had some transparency about why lucky isnt awping lol
5:29:56	kooshyy	@fl0m u watching the new spiderman?
5:29:58	hobrev	k0nfig can awp but his awp is like prime happy awping. he is so much better as a rifler there really is no reason to go to his awp regularly
5:29:59	supra_nightmare	if i was lucky, i would ask to leave honestly. its an insult at this point.
5:30:07	Twist__CS	%? will astralis comeback ?

5:30:57	RhinoIsSus	Just drop him yk
5:30:58	nmllr	Did BlameF know the core was leaving when he joined Astralis? I know he had said he doesn't want to IGL anymore when he joined.
5:30:58	n0r13k	i feel for him a lot, he's still so young Sadge
5:30:58	froux01	@slimrick6 Hahaha
5:31:00	christicall	@froux01 imagine not even lucky 3rd awp
5:31:01	K_Baarts	@fl0m bro?
5:31:01	s1mply_ant	or make him 6th man
5:31:07	hobrev	he lost confidence, its Jugi or koosta all over again
5:31:09	s1mply_ant	just seems so odd
5:31:10	STatisfacti0n	@nmllr glaive is still IGL
5:31:13	future_jason	just hearing a single interview from astralis and the first thought that comes to my mind is "cap"
5:31:15	Azaa97z	do you think he can change his name to unlucky ?
5:31:15	RhinoIsSus	like he did well at Blast showdown but still @fl0m
5:31:16	yourducky	borpaLick MLADY0
5:31:19	ThunderVikiing	could it be a confidence thing for lucky? maybe he feels like his awp is not good enough?
5:31:20	STatisfacti0n	@nmllr I'm sure blameF makes some mid round calls though
5:31:21	tehgin	LOL
5:31:23	macusjenner	i think lucky is too young and too shy to not just say, "fuck u guys, give me the awp and show u how its done"
5:31:23	silviu_cs	Well cadiaN said if he doesn't feel confident he asks someone else to AWP so I can see Lucky doing that

5:31:43	elblanco744	that are dancing KEKW
5:31:43	elfengradient	i think there was an interview and Lucky mentioned that he would like to try rifle sometimes.
5:31:45	audio_noodle	@fl0m like i get, that awping needs massive confidence, but like that isn't on lucky, it's an issue across the whole team
5:31:46	hobrev	shox playing that so confidently :D
5:31:46	amg_seuseo	Liquid SHox BTW
5:31:47	future_jason	Damn, Liquid shox hits those
5:31:49	nmllr	@STatisfacti0n Isn't the core going to Vitality though? So that would only be temporary.. unless I'm wrong on that.
5:31:49	BizarreMark	RADICAL MLADY0
5:31:49	Roya1tyCS	shox played that so bad lol
5:31:50	RhinoIsSus	Still got no money Astralis
5:31:50	s1mply_ant	NT shox that was a tough fight
5:31:51	Rei_J4	nt shox
5:31:56	Morde24	holy shit that 1v1 was a skirmish
5:31:58	yourducky	wtf monkaW
5:31:59	XeeVzz	liquid shox wins that
5:31:59	mjones	their money is trash
5:32:03	n0r13k	i like how shox still plays like a CSS player, as if the movement speed is the same
5:32:04	iizarian	i hope they win so we can get a map 3
5:32:05	oak_type	ASURORLIS COME BACK
5:32:09	RhinoIsSus	They still have no money Sadge
5:32:13	STatisfacti0n	@nmllr no dupreeh and magisk left astralis and are going to vitality with zonic as well
5:32:14	AFskillz	this is why glaive is main awp xD
5:32:18	reredakted	fl0mHeart
5:32:21	blackcat64	xyp9x should just awp hes the goat
5:32:23	future_synthwave	if he was just gonna rifle then why wouldnt they use bubzkij
5:32:25	macusjenner	yea but they arent giving it to him, and thats where the insecurity comes in i think
5:32:26	dotalegendery2	stat MLADY
5:32:30	STatisfacti0n	hey MLADY
5:32:33	BizarreMark	PepeLaugh imagine losing to a ded team

5:32:59	slimrick6	Period*
5:32:59	s1mply_ant	If they dont like his as an AWPer they can move him to 6th man or cut him and figure it out from there. They must just want him to rifle even if he want to AWP. its just not how business is done in CS
5:32:59	hobrev	the movement in csgo is much closer to source then 1.6

5:49:55	sharkey3322	Navi was being cocky imo
5:49:56	nero9833	@fl0m navi is the ultimate team vibe check
5:49:56	elfengradient	it could be vitality vs team liquid for grand finals
5:49:57	evilvillain	navi gonna go hard after the liquid loss
5:49:59	s1mply_ant	Gla1ve is a fantastic rifler and not having that in addition to the calling is a detriment to the team.
5:49:59	DrGehirn	2 months navi era POGGERS
5:50:00	1nduni	What was the score of the first map?
5:50:01	Diaz1	peepoW
5:50:03	evilvillain	s1mple gonna be on a war path
5:50:08	hobrev	this team looks completely different when kyojin and misutaa can play without pressure
5:50:09	itsPoZr	I feel bad for Lucky. It seems like every time Astralis lose the blame always goes to Lucky. @fl0m
5:50:09	silviu_cs	16-4 @1nduni
5:50:11	kooshyy	@fl0m navi clear winning grand slam then blast then pgl major
5:50:12	whitechocolate64	borpaChef this cum soufflé is turning out beautifully
5:50:13	audio_noodle	@fl0m i think vitality would get demolished, they don't have the same finesse at least so far

5:50:15	froux01	I think Vitality is just reaching new heights now
5:50:15	praeter15	Astralis doesnt have Dev1ce
5:50:16	1nduni	Holy shit
5:50:17	LeadOsprey58	Navi definitely gonna win against heroic, heroic looked worse against gambit than navi
5:50:17	stonejinxer	navi lost because they chose the m4 instead of a1s PeepoM
5:50:18	STatisfacti0n	s1mple losing to elige yesterday and his old team means he's gonna pop the fuck off from now on
5:50:19	slimrick6	I mean Navi kinda deserved to lose for saying they’re looking at TL as “practice”

7:08:38	iBUYPOWER	@yourducky oh i dont have a link KEKW
7:08:38	gedzz	ive been playing a little valorant recently and honestly you have to play with a different brain than your cs brain
7:08:40	ShootFarken	BabyRage stop saying bad things about my game
7:08:42	iBUYPOWER	i thought you were making it LUL
7:08:45	Treefi	They only get 15
7:08:49	yourducky	intern
7:08:52	yobtih	it’s a whole thing. I enjoy both. I would play both but I don’t have time
7:08:53	gedzz	you end up dying a lot deaths doing plays that might be good if it were cs but its simply not
7:08:54	tr3y919	resident sleeper
7:08:54	Expanses__	Valorant not for me man, mechanically the game's skill ceiling is way too low
7:08:55	yourducky	do I look llike I can draw
7:08:56	mamluku	is s1 waiting for this?
7:08:57	alexis809s	comeback incoming OOOO

7:09:01	hmminator	@fl0m how do you think a top csgo pro would perform in valo?
7:09:04	Morde24	@freakshow_sb 1. who the fuck cares. 2. I assume he eats the same and he is older so his metabolism regressed
7:09:09	Cake315	heroics pick
7:09:14	DavidGavin55	the abilities on valorant is a huge reason why I don't play that game. smokes, flashes, molo, and grenades are enough for me
7:09:16	piboy417	how didd  the Astralis  game go?
7:09:18	tavez_	@hmminator just watch when S1mple plays KEKW
7:09:19	jelbert_uwu	@gedzz I agree
7:09:20	Tvjuli	Valorant scratches the same "itch" for me than cs but the difference is that I already know and love cs
7:09:21	Kafkii	fl0m Crungo

7:09:52	SoporificPanda	these guys are all 20k hour playing same game old men playing with strategy because they have no genetics for gaming but tenz is much better he has talent and quick reactions and flicks if tenz played csgo s1mple would work in mcdonalds
7:09:57	mukulhayaran	these guys are all 20k hour playing same game old men playing with strategy because they have no genetics for gaming but tenz is much better he has talent and quick reactions and flicks if tenz played csgo s1mple would work in mcdonalds
7:10:01	l3ordon	DO you think CS players going to valorant is easier, or the other way around? @fl0m
7:10:01	tavez_	@slimrick6 definitely not, but the "best" is always changing rn
7:10:02	mamluku	and navi got ct mirage

7:10:19	whitechocolate64	HmmCouncil understood
7:10:20	rushil_20	@slimrick6 no he fell of massively after the iceland tourney he has been average for quite some time
7:10:20	waferthinmint	Valorant and CSGO have the same relationship as TF2 and overwatch imo. Both the disney channel version with freebee abilities instead of player controlled actions
7:10:22	yourducky	lowrated stat supra HmmCouncil
7:10:24	1volla	do you still think NaVi win it all?

10:54:42	TikToxin	the gameplay is faster which is nice and lot of that seems to play better
10:54:58	TikToxin	makes me want to play. I miss pubg but its so slow
10:55:00	officialviz	It's definitely PUBG but with abilities. The looting menu is quite similar, they added gun skins but the sounds are similar, the scopes are basically copied
10:55:09	officialviz	It's still a phenomenal A+ game

10:59:43	Doccy	idk if they fixed the hacker bug ]
10:59:52	Doccy	TF2 is also good
11:00:00	sevengaming_tv	I have only played one game of titanfall 2 multiplayer
11:00:06	frogoree	I prefer TF2 over TF2
11:00:06	McBubba03	Doccy no they haven't
11:00:06	Doccy	i mean if you want to play Titan Fall 2
11:00:11	sevengaming_tv	but the campaign was one of the most fun I ever played
11:00:20	McBubba03	TF2 is the best game ever don't @ me but no the bot issue isn't fixed
11:00:28	Doccy	block network access through the firewall
11:00:30	McBubba03	Most of us veteran players moved over to community servers
11:01:05	imnormalkorean	if apex got rid of sbmm is casual, I would play it so much more. Apex feels like ranked in almost any way you play it if you're a decent player
11:01:06	sevengaming_tv	when I got the movement course achievement in the titanfall 2 campaign I almost Kreygasm
