1:07:43	Generalannoyance13	they need to sponsor Mythic League

1:07:49	mozahzah	i think with more people watching CS now, more sponsorships and corporate funding will increase
1:07:51	hantrax1	a compendeium would be great
1:07:51	hobrev	there was a team in the second tier of the DPC going on that had to retire from the tournament because one of their players had a second job as a professional football player and he couldnt participate in matches

1:08:08	ayaz555	fl0m thoughts on what role the potential 5th player on EG needs to fill in
1:08:09	MunchingKitten	that's basically a Mythic Cup though fl0mSwole
1:08:09	NebChilly	valve should put a % of case money into crowd funds
1:08:11	hemo_tox	@Generalannoyance13 VALVE LETSGOMYTHIC  SPONSOR MYTHIC LETSGOMYTHIC
1:08:12	davaddacarry	or have a building pool for something like the grand slam
1:08:23	Cacemen	I feel like what should happen in CS is the major should be given a better spotlight. I feel like nowadays the major is only really exciting for someone who has been watching CS for a while.
1:08:24	c0rkmcnortis	fl0m do you think CS's popularity as a spectator sport has grown?
1:08:24	Just_Melo	Halo has crowd funding but not CSGO... SMH valve NotLikeThis

1:09:18	Humb1edore	it really is the best/easiest esports to watch and understand
1:09:25	haliyax	that being said , Riot Games should have a bigger prize than Dota INT if they crowd fund it via Skins like Dota does
1:09:26	Togepi_007	how do you see CS 5 years from now? will it be bigger than what it is now with covid?
1:09:27	c0rkmcnortis	do you think Valorant had something to do with that? seems like a lot of people are getting their first exposure to this kind of game from Val streamers
1:09:27	Humb1edore	big thanks to the casters

1:09:48	roguenighthawk	What did Arden get for winning the grand slam as a coach? Do you know @fl0m
1:09:50	HappyCow9	I never play CS anymore, but still love watching it rooNom
1:09:51	ItsAho	Shroud also loves to shit on cs
1:10:00	V1ZzxX	valve does the opposite and if they had their rule they would have taken the cut from prize pool as well
1:10:10	ccuurrttiiss	anecdotally i feel like the older player base doesnt play as much as they used to, but still gets a lot of joy out of watching tournaments/csgo content. at least thats how it is for me
1:10:11	mukulhayaran	%? 69
1:10:11	Cacemen	fl0m you once said something about launching a case for the major that helps found it. I think that would be really cool
1:10:11	Nightbot	Joris says 94%
1:10:14	oscarrock	How do you feel about the lack of a half-time break in this tournament?
1:10:15	TohsakaSX	I dont play cs much anymore and took a break from watching from 2019-late 2021. But ive come back to watching you and tournaments, cause theres still enjoyment in it for me
1:10:16	c0rkmcnortis	@ItsAho im convinced Shroud has single-handedly turned the zoomers off of CS
1:10:18	darthballz45	ill be honest I don't really play CS (playing the "other game") but I absolutely watching high level CS over any esport. the major was amazing and reinforced how great competitive CSGO is
1:10:21	AussieNate	@happycow9 I‚Äôm in the same boat

1:46:41	SaintedPIacebo	It used to be at like 106k iirc. But i dont think its the largest anymore.
1:46:46	its_spectrums_fault	yea its still the biggest
1:46:47	Generalannoyance13	100,000+ capacity I think
1:46:47	entea	I drive by that stadium every day and their cock is still firmly laid on the ground as biggest
1:46:48	Rick76	‚ùåichigan

1:47:15	lo33y	@lo33y Nah trust me the rugby game at Twickenham is massive
1:47:15	SoporificPanda	i think it is because newer stadiums are nicer with chair backs and more boxes so less capacity
1:47:16	zThrice	Its funny how most of the CFB records are because someone racked up crazy stats in like 1950
1:47:16	icemanyayo	@fl0m its the 3rd biggest stadium in the entire world LUL

2:12:55	ChosenDew	fortnite is huge on the switch and consoles
2:12:58	Vexcell_TV	Games like CS and Fortnite will never die
2:12:59	ItsPatch1	@ItsPatch1 it's different right, but in terms of satisfaction on kills and shots and stuff it's nowhere close. Val is like moving through gum almost
2:13:03	rony9	will source 2 change the gunplay of csgo??
2:13:05	daltonf9	once the planes came into fortnite it ruined the game for me
2:13:06	Phavurs	fl0mS fl0mS fl0mS fl0mS
2:13:11	shakezla	@mosiahs71 agreed, I love both games but for some reason when I click heads in val its more satisfying
2:13:12	iijonesyy	nah it was just bad
2:13:13	Hektic2	Aim assist to PC? KEKW
2:13:16	BeauxGnar	It was on the original Xbox
2:13:16	V1ZzxX	fortnight was good now they made updates boring
2:13:18	irlvntkevin	i got real into cs for xbox for real
2:13:18	dibnah1	aim assist LUL
2:13:18	StochasticDiscount	There's definitely an expectation of updates, but I don't know if it's necessarily related to Fortnite. That's been a general trend for the last decade with service games (including CSGO)
2:13:19	GeorgeLincolnRockweII	Source 2 will never happen
2:13:23	silviu_cs	CS will come to Steam Deck tho
2:13:23	Nightbot	Counter-Strike
2:13:25	d0zerCS	They should replace this overlay with the Silvercast overlay NODDERS
2:13:26	MANIKcc	kind of like new world without character creation Kapp

2:13:31	ChosenDew	@BeauxGnar it was 360
2:13:31	Cacemen	with the updates times that fortnite as I feel like if they decide to slow things down that can go really wrong
2:13:31	Madfish2021	source for the original xbox was crazy wtf LUL
2:13:32	sen_sh1	I thought CS was dying when they changed Cobble
2:13:33	atasm77	Imagine you build in banana lol
2:13:34	c0rkmcnortis	xyp9x cheater
2:13:35	apoodle_	now that microsoft has bought activions-blizzard, cs might actually see a revival on playstation
2:13:39	black_lorax	they added some setting to make it "better" for the steamdeck but it doesnt do enough still
2:13:41	AlfredoInVR	My problem is the core gameplay loop of CS (join matchmaking, play first to 16, rank change) is super bland imo
2:13:43	entea	cross-play really divides the community in the competitive sense

2:13:43	wtc__11	but if they add too much to fast like siege that could really kill the game

2:14:03	florusRL	because, microsoft
2:14:05	BeauxGnar	@ChosenDew They may have been backwards compatible, but I had it on the Original Xbox
2:14:05	s1mply_AnT	yup
2:14:07	c0rkmcnortis	@AlfredoInVR there is infinite depth to it though
2:14:08	StochasticDiscount	Gyro aiming is a real thing though
2:14:09	MemeDealer95	i hope CS doesn't have crossplay on steamdeck
2:14:09	AFugy	peepoTalk  vp
2:14:10	emeraldore_	Yup
2:14:11	Thermophobe	laughs in apex legends
2:14:13	BudDiesel	the right amount of aim assist is none lol
2:14:14	en7oo	crossplay only works for games like Rocket League that doesn't really give you a advantage on one particular console or pc
2:14:16	rahatrumi132	Ohh my God g1ave!!
2:14:22	Hektic2	Imagine Csgo aim assist on pc
2:14:22	dibnah1	console is like stabilisers on a bike

2:14:46	rony9	@hektic2 no need to imagine
2:14:47	jrsprinks	it's so frustrating when your friends refuse to be pc gamers. cross play is my only solace
2:14:47	rapid3yemovem3nt	Aim assist in competitive scenes takes so much away skill wise. If they did it in a way where it wasn't literally cheating it would be okay.
2:14:49	feynze_	@Hektic2 thats just aim assist/aimbot
2:14:52	V1ZzxX	blame has 0 kills lol

2:14:56	en7oo	@iijonesyy point is more bc most people use a controller even on console tbh
2:14:56	rootbeard88	@fl0m how many people in valve MM do you think are using soft aim assist? some people i encounter in MM vs faceit is crazy tbh
2:14:57	ayaz555	why consoles not have mouse and keyboard support, ps5 and xbox now has great specs, cross play shouldnt be an issue there
2:14:57	iijonesyy	@en7oo the performance alone improves ppls ability on pc compared to console
2:14:59	dbz1h	Just give everyone aim assist and walls.

2:15:13	yuzuki007	yeah, you should see fortnite comp controller is forever op
2:15:13	mosiahs71	@ItsPatch1 idk what u mean, but what I can tell you Val gunplay is defo more satisfying than cs. its not really a debate cus Val designed their gunplay to be like that. The satisfaction comes from when you tap heads, its highly rewarded unlike cs. again im not saying Val is better or worse
2:15:17	yuzuki007	literally insta kills people
2:15:21	Memory_ggs	i play on keyboard and im the second best rank
2:15:26	Thermophobe	csgo crossplatform for non competitive modes would still slap

2:16:32	torp3d0_	@ItsPatch1 Honestly I feel the other way around, since Valor is more "random" with a lot more of run and gun, what makes valo more satisfying I guess it's the sounds that the game makes when you kill / tap heads

Val is not a game where u mesmorise spray patterns and smoke lineups, the gunplay is more about 1taps-short sprays. if u dont get a hs, the kill doesnt really feel good. spraying in val feels terrible
