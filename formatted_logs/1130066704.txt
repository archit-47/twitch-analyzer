1:34:13	siiiif	From a shape language theory perspective, cocks are more attractive. They have a natural curve, a natural line of motion, and the cock head has naturally contrasting shapes, the shaft being a curved rectangle and the head being more triangular. The penis has a square and triangle shape, which communicates trustability but the triangle presents an edge, so perhaps the penis is not all it seems, which interests people.
