0:45:05	LucidR9	Yo, I killed sheriff in that last game and I just wanted to let you know that he tasted real good, like all stream-snipers do. I ate his flesh after fucking destroying his ass in a left eye peek situation, with disadvantageous ping. It was possibly one of the greatest counterstrike moments to ever happen.
