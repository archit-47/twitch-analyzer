3:00:38	praeter15	The main difference between a burrito and a taco is the shell size. Tacos are generally a lighter snack or meal, while a larger burrito is a hearty, full meal. For a taco, it can either be a soft or hard corn shell, while a burrito is generally a larger flour tortilla, as corn tortillas tend to fall apart more easily

3:50:39	STatisfacti0n	I think custom keebs are really cool, but they're also a $200+ investment that I don't need to make because I'm more than happy with the keyboard I have LUL
3:50:41	gotzilla12	True I've had a razer and it just broke on me used it less than a year
