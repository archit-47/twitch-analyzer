2:46:42	bolottekid	SorrowInRain so the tiebreaker should be around the map difference between them, which makes strife the lowest

2:47:14	SorrowInRain	bolottekid so the mini-league is like this: mythic 0-2 onetap, onetap 1-2 strife, strife 1-2 mythic. so by map diff, mythic should be in the bottom. but, onetap should be on the top by this rule.

4:53:54	LowRatedHighlander	@hobrev no it only gives it camo vision if the monkeys he’s leaching vision off of has it
4:54:05	Saint_Helix	boozeelive buckeyes143 thanks sadge
4:54:11	PHUTARE	Random question but why does your Bloons look so bright and vibrant?
4:54:18	LowRatedHighlander	So it’ll have camo vision when attacking off the ninja but not anything else
4:54:21	Buckeyes143	sadgeBusinessTime
4:54:23	hobrev	no no I dont mean the level 2, I mean the submerged sub
4:54:32	hobrev	level 4 or higher
4:54:39	LowRatedHighlander	@hobrev it reveals same as the necro monkey
4:54:39	Bipolarbear_TV	@hobrev sort of, it strips camo off of bloons that enter its reange
4:54:39	Saint_Helix	sadgeBusinessTime indeed
4:54:42	Bipolarbear_TV	*range
4:55:04	LowRatedHighlander	But it has the same problem except in my opinion a bit worse because the blips that reveal feel slower than the necro monkey
4:55:05	hobrev	is it just that for the whole build?

4:55:54	LowRatedHighlander	Although it may be quicker if you get the next path where it does damage submerged
4:55:56	Mentalstatemike	i know of some really good mental asylums in your area NODDERS
4:56:09	LowRatedHighlander	I haven’t gotten to mess with it too much
4:56:10	praeter15	top path ninja is the best path Peepo
4:56:19	hobrev	level 5 buccaneer middle path is also good money farm
4:56:22	LowRatedHighlander	@praeter15 is right Peepo
4:56:27	bolottekid	make sense
4:56:31	Saint_Helix	mentalstatemike yeah? Free food and a bed, I'm down.
4:56:33	bolottekid	Prayge

4:58:50	LowRatedHighlander	Yeah exactly
4:58:58	Mentalstatemike	yeah exactly
4:59:11	hobrev	0-4-2 is a good safety to start, because it makes your biggest dps dealer be able to hit camo
