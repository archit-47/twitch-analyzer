0:22:46	1amdaredevil	but if they make MM 128 tick and have better AC, what will I blame when I lose?
0:22:51	SupraUK_	!eu
0:22:51	Nightbot	EU MM is easier because it works as intended. NA MM is more difficult because there's a higher proportion of cheaters and rank disparities make games difficult due to a smaller player base.

0:23:53	ImDippinIn	i play mm with my girl in mid silver and i never even thought of cheaters simply cuz i don't care. sucks for new players because they can't exactly play faceit, they'd get stomped. its a headache

3:37:01	GFYMeowMix	But I would’ve expected a different strategy had that rule not been scrapped
3:37:07	Goosh3D	Or he saw you first maybe
3:37:08	supra_nightmare	they are trying to stop chelsea from doing chelsea things with the rule. score one goal and sit 9 defenders its boring to watch
