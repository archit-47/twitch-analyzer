1:15:08	pelloo	@pelloo No I am not, devve is 100% the better player between him and phzy but he is not a star carry like Niko or S1mple. He works amazingly if the system around him is stable and good, but it isn't, and devve won't fix the problems that NIP have

3:56:21	Ficii	It was between rush and jks, and they weren't going to admit signing jks was a mistake
3:56:23	Ta1yo_Kun	How well did Rush do in Valorant? didn't really hear much about him
3:56:23	Saleh_ma	ASTRALIS is a dead team unfortunately :(
3:56:24	CrovvCSGO	I will say that EG has some issues, but Rush is not the largest one.

3:58:16	EINacho	@Sun__House getting near instantly headshot
3:58:17	iVex	gachiBASS
3:58:18	flames2802	nitro took some serious shots at NA valorant
3:58:18	imnoahh	@CrovvCSGO an instantly regrettable situation lol
3:58:19	paracetamolhelps	@fl0m like astral are playing the simplest tactical maps tooo mirage and d2 like this is so bad
3:58:19	BooomerNinja	@Pappy_Pud I hate stat people with a passion NODDERS
3:58:20	avacraft_fps	this is not looking good for Astralis
3:58:20	strafeeow	astralis is actually embarrassing to watch, its so sad
3:58:21	notkodha	@spencerayy not to be that person but haven't valorant only pros been saying this like every month KEKW
3:58:22	vexnstylezz	this is the last game today right
3:58:23	JohnWicksPupper	@benchmaker18 thanks :D
3:58:24	mannensson_	Feel sorry for Lucky, he isnt ready for top tier CS. He seems so unaware and misses to many shots..
3:58:25	balboflow	fuck dust 2
3:58:27	thegunarse	GG
3:58:32	balboflow	hi flom how are you??
3:58:41	ezio_desmondmiles	who thinks lucky is going to be benched soon if he keeps whiffing like this ?
3:58:51	cosmic_sasquatch	omg astralis is getting destroyed
3:58:52	siDDziy	Where is bub?
3:58:59	flames2802	does astralis go international if this doesnt work?
3:59:00	peeplomS	new coach?
3:59:00	sarge10	Do you think theyre giving Blame these roles in anticipation of a new player coming in? Cause otherwise this teams dead already
3:59:01	LowRatedHighlander	siDDziy he got released
3:59:03	Ficii	@ezio_desmondmiles nobody, astralis will say he's great and people will believe it
3:59:03	benchmaker18	@ezio_desmondmiles Who are they going to replace him with?
3:59:06	andrew5932	he baits tho
3:59:19	CrovvCSGO	@imnoahh I just remember that he wasnt even in the lobby and I get s1mple wasnt the same person back then. But holy moly the dude was... yeah
3:59:22	benchmaker18	@siDDziy bub left Astralis
3:59:25	Pappy_Pud	fl0m hates denmark so he probably wants astralis stock to plummet
3:59:27	flames2802	oh wow
3:59:27	cosmic_sasquatch	they should have benched xyp, and got in bub imo. bub would be more motivated to improve
3:59:27	Ta1yo_Kun	@spencerayy there is legit zero reasoning behind that conclusion. guy must be on some dangerous shit
3:59:28	Rei_J4	Konfig started strong on Astralis but has certainly dropped off since then
3:59:28	sunny1854	Astralis should have a different standard as 4x Major Winners
3:59:33	paracetamolhelps	@fl0m what im saying is k0nfig looks like k0nfig after RUSH left col like so out of it
3:59:34	AsSaSsInJ0HN	time to buy shorts monkaW
3:59:36	weebspegetti	hot take on nip, they should either become a t2 team and act as a developmental step for swe cs or they should go for all of scandinavia and start comming in english because, unless brollan comes to nip, sweden just doesnt seem to have enough firepower for a tier 1 team
3:59:36	DeSiReKzLoL	big is a dust 2 team why did astrals not ban it smh
3:59:36	vfxCaL	@ezio_desmondmiles why would they bench him over xyp? atleast lucky has been clutching up
3:59:37	VirtualEnv	@flames2802 it's not like NA cs doing good. NA overall in shambles Sadge
3:59:38	rygaardhansen	K0nfig is really good, but too hot and cold for my taste

4:20:42	YuutsuUK	FIGURED IT
4:20:43	f0rmie	@fl0m so true hahahahahahahahahahahah
4:20:43	DerXello	BIG knew what they wanted to do with Faven, astralis seems clueless about the team composition
4:20:45	sanmitra	Cumback PauseFish ?
4:20:45	cyanideaddict_	KEKW
4:20:46	Kado_CS	@RioShimada i mean he probably should've tried to hide the awp but when your down man advantage against an eco having an awp can be kinda shit
4:20:48	TestTubeBaba	LUL
4:20:50	dcn1ghtwing	they need to drop xyp and lucky and bring in valde and farlig
4:20:53	dustY_Fries	@fl0m who you got for the Superb Owl? I know it's off topic, but we know this game is over
4:21:00	don_10killer	%? CUMBACK

4:21:14	kamelski	seems like astralis has too many leaders still.. they need to harmonize stuff
4:21:18	dieandgopls	Let k0nfig be the 2nd guy in always
4:21:18	typhl0sion	yo
4:21:19	Tafty11	Blamef needs to get that baiting on control.
4:21:19	1KERY	but then konfig goes as trade/sup behind blameF
4:21:19	mannensson_	Can you answer why players that save his gun when the team dont have money trade the gun to the hot player in the team? Like xyp should give ak to blame int his case? I almost never see that in pro cs @fl0m
4:21:22	Priyansh205	stafford might retire after that
4:21:23	Locke547	what is the super bowl?
4:21:23	AsteL999	blamef played a bit entry near the end of that col roster and it worked pretty well
4:21:23	Pappy_Pud	Joe BRR gonna crush those hopes, sorry bud
4:21:27	Chazzy14	Konfig just there for the vibes tbh
4:21:28	Jnieco	I want stafford and Von to win but I dont want the rams to win ):

4:21:40	nafoxara	When's the super bowl again?
4:21:41	Silkjackel222	@fl0m ask tarik who wins superbowl.. imean he got bengals in somehow
4:21:46	kamelski	faven sees 0 action at long lol
4:21:47	RioShimada	@RioShimada I mean ofc awp is shit against Eco. But a 4v5. Against an eco still. You cant just throw away money without properly hiding it. It was a free gift
4:21:50	IceRenamonGaming	Sadge
4:21:50	Priyansh205	AD is just gonna kill burrow
