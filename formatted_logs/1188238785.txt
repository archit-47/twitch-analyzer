4:47:08	random_factz	Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, which happened to bring a laugh or a smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. @yobtih is probably a mod in here and he is the one that banned me. Anyway, I'm glad to be back

5:01:47	random_factz	Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, which happened to bring a laugh or a smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. ChidaZ1CoM is probably a mod in here and he is the one that banned me. Anyway, I'm glad to be back Peepo

7:57:33	Madfish2021	@flxingflea33337 there are no drops man you have to buy tokens and redeem them
7:57:43	nanerpus_	PGL is really fucking this whole partnered streamer thing up
7:57:48	jebby__	Grim seems like another one of those players that excels in MDL and the tier 2 NA scene who then does better by being surrounded by better players. Probably a dozen other players like that who you could replace him with right now.
7:57:50	nanerpus_	!drio
7:57:54	nanerpus_	!drop

8:02:21	kbags87K	he was struggling a bit
8:02:23	NebChilly	i think Tarik is the only arguable solid choice to replace Grim. Grim imo is a far better player at this point though

8:51:01	Killer_Panda2k11	I saw Jame at the gas station, he was arguing with the cashier about his expired coupons, telling her that he just wanted to save 50 cents on his redbull. He argued with her for 15 minutes until Sanji just pulled out his credit card and just paid for his whole order.
8:51:01	praeter15	Grand final time: it's Faze vs Astralis. The astralis boys are trembling with great fear, but once they walk out onto the stage for map 1 they shock the world. They rip their stellar jerseys off to reveal: CLOUD 9 JERSEYS, astralis has been cloud 9 this whole time after Henry G bought country of Denmark. Faze smirk. Rain steps forward and says "we have plenty of clay now"
