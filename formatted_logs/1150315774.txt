0:33:48	Nightbot	936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.
0:33:54	elhubanov	obo has a better mic, but somehow his mic also retains this cam mic quality
0:33:55	Booooooolin	siiiif OOOO
0:33:55	abhi007bond	!936p
0:33:56	Nightbot	936p provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown; however, it was causing issues with fl0m's resolution, so he switched to 1080p.
