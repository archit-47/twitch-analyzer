5:14:54	THEnetplayWARRIOR	they actually cost less taking inflation into account
5:14:59	PapaUdds	100 bucks for the new back 4 blood with the DLC. Its been years since ive bought a new title
5:14:59	STatisfacti0n	^
5:15:01	LowRatedHighlander	Video games haven’t changed price in forever
5:15:03	cardboardtoast	they dont really go down in ptice it feels like though
5:15:08	STatisfacti0n	video games have largely been $60 for years now
5:15:10	LtNotzoClutch	peepoFAT nice!
5:15:19	two_drop	This is why @fl0m is #139 in the world chat. Dude never takes lunch breaks.
5:15:23	crypt1ci_i	what kind of curry my fav is masomon
5:15:25	PapaUdds	80 bucks min for me to get a new game I wish it was 60 haha
5:15:25	STatisfacti0n	that said, the market for video games has also grown exponentially
5:15:26	LowRatedHighlander	Yeah if you’re including dlc and stuff that’s different
5:15:33	Kafkii	Video games these days cost less than they did like 20-30 years ago NODDERS
5:15:34	TheMinnesotaGamer	put in steam wishlist, wait for sale, buy. EZ

5:16:00	LowRatedHighlander	It’s kinda weird how they’ve been 60 for so long and never grew with inflation
5:16:02	lowtierbean	@cardboardtoast if were talking about Nintendo games true but all the other games go down after about a month
5:16:04	Puddin_Wing	20 years ago you actually got the entire game when you bought it @Kafkii
5:16:06	abhi007bond	1TAP
5:16:10	crypt1ci_i	@fl0m what kind of curry?  my wife and i love yellow
5:16:17	STatisfacti0n	@fl0m but you could stay with GTR Sadge
5:16:18	Kafkii	Puddin_Wing well blame EA and Activision for that
5:16:34	Kafkii	Puddin_Wing Also feeny, whats your favorite type of lychee MmmHmm
5:16:35	cardboardtoast	@lowtierbean I was looking at dark souls recently, 3 is still $60
5:16:38	abhi007bond	%? duckDance
5:16:38	crypt1ci_i	could be masomon or pangang
5:16:38	Nightbot	Joris says 7%
5:16:41	lowtierbean	@Puddin_Wing games are also a lot bigger than they were 20 years ago
5:16:42	TheMinnesotaGamer	@Puddin_Wing but if was broke they didnt update.
5:16:43	GFYMeowMix	@Puddin_Wing KEKWait A COMPLETED GAME?!?! monkaW

5:16:52	astrononymous	steph curry is pretty sick
5:16:55	Puddin_Wing	Idk it's some candy they sell at the vietnamese grocery i go to @Kafkii
5:16:56	UtkarshJr7	@fl0m Are you going to watch the first game tomorrow? PepeLaugh
5:16:58	crypt1ci_i	so it depends on the spice used in it
5:17:03	hunter6925	yellow curry pattern index 661 (red gem)
5:17:06	Piesso	boof, there it is
5:17:15	Kafkii	you ever try rambutan?
5:17:17	Kafkii	MmmHmm
5:17:21	Puddin_Wing	genuinely not sure
5:17:30	lowtierbean	@cardboardtoast idk i got it a few years back for $20 plus you can wait on sales and if its for consoles get it used for like 10
5:17:32	BizarreMark	Pog far cry 6
5:17:33	LtNotzoClutch	Just picked up some smoked fish from a Russian market
5:17:34	Kafkii	its SUPER good
5:17:34	apoodle10	I'd argue that the effective profit margin on games has increased, since distribution has gotten cheaper and has a wider range than it used to have; that somewhat compensates for the price remaining at 60 bucks
5:17:40	literallyaunicorn	Pog far cry 6
5:17:44	THEnetplayWARRIOR	far cry 6 was ResidentSleeper
5:17:50	LowRatedHighlander	POGGIES WE GOT PRACCY

5:18:37	macbookfps	@Kafkii i love rambutan

5:55:04	peach_vs_mango	Hey @fl0m does your sub income depend on from which region the sub is coming from? coz subs in asia are dirt cheap
5:55:16	Puddin_Wing	I agree, habanero is right at the line for me. I don't need anything hotter really @GFYMeowMix

5:56:24	Puddin_Wing	so i make sure to visit and scoop some when i can
5:56:26	PHUTARE	Its cheaper in other regions?
5:56:37	cardboardtoast	@PHUTARE yes
5:56:38	MisterDoomHimslf	yeah its cheaper for me
5:56:38	LowRatedHighlander	Some regions yes
5:56:42	peach_vs_mango	@PHUTARE Yes, I have head in india it's 4x cheap
5:56:47	GFYMeowMix	made a yucatan habanero salsa a couple years back PogTasty
5:56:49	revfalse	I doubt it will increase the amount of subs, like ask yourself why do people sub?
5:56:50	BryansGames	there's regions outside the US? KEKW
5:56:54	revfalse	not because the cost
5:56:54	senorvac02	they should release twitch prime in india
5:56:59	PHUTARE	Thats interesting.. wonder why
5:57:00	revfalse	because the streamer they like
5:57:03	GFYMeowMix	PogTasty 🔥 PogTasty
5:57:03	sevengaming_tv	we eat habanero jelly w/ cream cheese on toast or crackers and it is incredible Puddin_Wing

5:57:20	Puddin_Wing	yeah that's the fuckin move @sevengaming_tv
5:57:20	UtkarshJr7	How much is it in US?
5:57:31	LowRatedHighlander	5 bucks
5:57:33	aeboK	sevengaming_tv PogTasty
5:57:38	GFYMeowMix	you can also thinly slice the habaneros with thinly sliced onions in some like juice and use that as topping of sorts
5:57:45	UtkarshJr7	Its 1.46usd here
5:57:47	cardboardtoast	@PHUTARE general wealth differences of people in other countries I would guess
5:57:52	sevengaming_tv	my family is on a wave when it comes to food, I didnt get this body by chance peepoGiggles
5:57:58	peach_vs_mango	Hey @fl0m why not you give me mone I setup sub flux from asia LUL
5:58:00	Puddin_Wing	I honestly will just like snack on one while I use others to prepare stuff
5:58:09	cardboardtoast	@UtkarshJr7 $4.99 for tier 1 in the US
5:58:20	Puddin_Wing	but gettin free jars of them lets me be a little loose with em like that

5:59:07	revfalse	agree
5:59:08	senorvac02	why not release twitch prime rather than lower sub prices
5:59:22	priiide_	@senorvac02 twitch prime doesnt make twitch money

5:59:59	supra_nightmare	then there are people like me who gift subs every month but i never sub myself. doesnt mean i dont love fl0m's beautiful face :)
6:00:01	peach_vs_mango	@senorvac02 People don't even know twitch prime exists. It's hella expensive too
6:00:03	cardboardtoast	they need to incentivize tier 3 subs to make up the loss it seems like
6:00:18	Chezpuf	they should do the same thing for subs

6:02:03	ttMidnight	Im from Trinidad and Tobago and I'd love to be able to sub to my favourite streamers. However foreign exchange (USD) is really hard to get here right now as well as our local debit cards dont work with online purchases. Only way to sub is with a credit card which most people dont have access to..
6:02:05	Puddin_Wing	Did you genuinely just compare me to the english fl0m
6:02:10	senorvac02	is it true if u have adblock ur demographics dont get counted? like the location widget? @fl0m

6:03:17	jamejacobs	you can change the cost of a sub by vpn monkaW
6:03:18	Chachslayer1	@fl0m did you just assume my socioeconomic class?

6:55:40	Xargling	@fl0m AC is why I refuse to download Valorant. Faceit AC and ESEA I am okay with but giving 10c more access to my computer is scary becuase of their location.
6:55:49	gobbybraves	with the amount of AI technology out there, in the amount of data that I know valve collects, I've been a server side bell to this point?

6:58:57	Xargling	What they need instead of an invasive AC is something like ClamAV that scans everything that is hooking the process when it starts, and looks for certain signatures that they would have to keep a database of signatures and keep it up to date and hire people to search for and create signatures of all the cheats as tehy come out.

7:01:22	Xargling	@Gearslayer360 everything is old school just with AI/ML over top of it. But if you leave that to just let AI/ML take care of you will get som many FP's. You would need something that is still reviewed by a person prior saying this is a valid sig.

7:04:03	GFYMeowMix	@dd2331d SHRUGGERS i used to not get any confirmation and XP for "correct" ones on spin botters marking all as clearly cheating until i marked the opposite for "griefing" section. even though to me it is griefing.
7:04:03	Sinthetix	@Gearslayer360 I miss those days, was so fun
7:04:04	CroaTV	@dd2331d feels dutch man

7:05:05	RyMcGillis	i don't normally get a chance to catch a full stream. chances we open cases today?
7:05:12	CroaTV	@dd2331d honestly lost so much cs hype since the new laws :(

7:05:38	GFYMeowMix	@dd2331d ya it has to be based on what they write in the description for reasoning. sometimes you gotta unmark the third option too if it's only aim/walls and not scripting or autofire.

7:07:54	gobbybraves	@fl0m , I also don't understand why valve would stop it right? you have more people creating accounts and getting cases, then buying a key and opening that... That's their business model isn't it? like if you Google the number of cases opened... it's legitimately like a billion dollars worth of cases right? so why deter cheaters as a company? It doesn't make any sense why they would from a business perspective right?

8:20:03	LowRatedHighlander	yeah its just gonna take some balancing thats all. hes gonna have to learn that side stuff can mean a lot to the rest of the players and the rest of the players have to learn that the main story is also important. thats like the hardest part of being a dm is balancing everyones expectations
