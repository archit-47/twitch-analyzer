2:55:42	SandwichSundays	Testicular cancer is highly treatable especially if caught early. Most of the time a lump or swelling on the testicle is the first symptom. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves or their partner, very few are found by a physician. So it’s recommend that all men examine their testicles monthly.

2:59:18	BooomerNinja	According to world population studies, approximately 108 billion people have lived on this planet. Assuming that the average lifespan of all these people was 25, there has been around 2.7 trillion years of life, if we multiply this by the number of days in a year (365), there is a total of 985,500,000,000,000 days of life (985.5 trillion days). Not once in any of those days did anybody ask.

3:00:40	BooomerNinja	What if somebody did ask, huh, what then? I'm sure they were quite satisfied with the answer. But you, no, you cannot for the life of you find a way to somehow think about what someone else thinks or feels. When you imply that nobody asked, you're talking solely about yourself. The world doesn't revolve around you. Try to find the simple joys of life instead of wasting perhaps the best years of your life away, sitting in your shit smeared, cheeto dust covered, cum ergonomic office chair

3:15:26	praeter15	From a shape language theory perspective, cocks are more attractive. They have a natural curve, a natural line of motion, and the cock head has naturally contrasting shapes, the shaft being a curved rectangle and the head being more triangular. The penis has a square and triangle shape, which communicates trustability but the triangle presents an edge, so perhaps the penis is not all it seems, which interests people. Of course that's entirely from a purely shape language theory perspective lol.
