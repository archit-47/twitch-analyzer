0:17:55	TestTubeBaba	shox to Liquid now is better than flusha to C9 in 2018 xD
0:17:56	andrewmedaTV	@apoodle10 if Nitro comes back then you have at least the IGL part. Shox can take over for NAF since I think NAF is gonna head wherever stew goes. But i'm also having a bit of peepoFoil with that thought

0:31:05	kopiiite	also wasnt that during the kreig meta
0:31:08	GeorgeTAshes	@Brodosaur don't get me wrong I wanna see the guy win but I my faith is wilting the more teams he goes to with no results

0:31:38	andrewmedaTV	@DavidGavin55 I'd assume so if they can't find another IGL. Though he may want to just be a hybrid/awper player now

0:32:26	someth11n	they kinda overperformed
0:32:31	apoodle10	you can't practice to win anything like they did
0:32:49	chinolinguino	its the classic focusing on the wrong things when u play well
0:32:51	andrewmedaTV	@DavidGavin55 they still need to get one. We don't know who is staying yet so they may have more room opening up

0:33:28	Kraken_Lord	RIP twiszzt
0:33:28	cmohrtv	I still feel like nitr0 isnt skilled enough if they do picked him up they need to get a sick awper to make up for it
0:33:28	xaler_cs	not sure elige and stew can be on the same team without nitro
0:33:33	DavidGavin55	@andrewmedaTV ah yea thats true

0:33:51	chinolinguino	are elige and stew at odds with each other?
0:33:52	Piethrouer	so what you're saying is they need someone cool calm and collected like m0e
0:34:06	Dankner	@Piethrouer lmao

0:35:07	senorvac02	do u think s1mple will be on Navi for his entire career
0:35:09	andrewmedaTV	@chinolinguino Richard Lewis kinda talked about it on BTN because Elige has a view on how to react and play situations and Stew is more of a feel in the moment type of person
0:35:09	GeorgeTAshes	@Piethrouer Also that NRG roster fucks and needs to return
0:35:22	apoodle10	what liquid needs right now is basically north american boombl4 + a decent awper
0:35:26	equisdexde	nitr0 come back to cs pls
0:35:35	hobrev	nitr0 adren combo would be so sick to get back
0:35:40	Brodosaur	@Piethrouer you shitpost everywhere without remorse thats respect +1
0:35:48	Kraken_Lord	@apoodle10 so if stewie sticks in liquid and refines being an igl

0:35:49	Piethrouer	it's what i do
0:35:52	Piethrouer	im shit
0:35:53	Dankner	they should do n1tro,naf,elige,twistzz and stew

0:47:22	Hameau08	As a Swede I have a hard time to understand
0:47:23	speciality_	They aren’t close, Norwegians can understand more of both than either
0:47:25	SupraUK_	i know right, i need chris to go online so i can send a resub message
0:47:26	bluehipp0	as a German I can sometimes understand Swedish or Norwegian, but never Danish
0:47:26	tjsumm	similar but any language is always tricky to speak
0:47:28	jakeovic	From a danish man: Its not that close
0:47:29	dooboodles	fl0m new coach of g2

0:47:37	SoporificPanda	it is partially mutually intelliglbe language but you can't just pick up and go without issue
0:47:39	Hameau08	Danish understand us but we can’t really understand them if they speak fast @fl0m
0:47:39	nutty_bud	danish is hard to understand at first cuz the way they say thing u just need to ghet use to it
0:47:40	mcWoodst3r	no they are not. Danish can understan swedish, but sedes have trouble with danish. Especially if your from Sthlm / north of sweden. It will be hard at first to understand coms in danish
0:47:41	skwiddd	I mean does device speak swedish?

5:06:35	GFYMeowMix	badco2 was legiiiit
5:07:05	sjoerdtheman	c0rkmcnortis i think splitgate does something unique and inplements it in a good way, this just looks like another halo game
5:07:22	c0rkmcnortis	It doesn’t even feel like a good halo game :(
5:07:40	c0rkmcnortis	halo on mouse just feels… not satisfying

5:19:53	STatisfacti0n	but no, that guy was pretty adamant that his opinion was fact and halo is a waste of time because it's not as good
5:20:03	Doccy	@atinymaneater69 he is using the BR not the dmr
5:20:14	we3bly	switch to controller yet?
5:20:15	STatisfacti0n	that's the BR

5:20:30	atinymaneater69	sorry lmao
5:20:33	STatisfacti0n	BR = 3 round burst
5:20:36	STatisfacti0n	AR = Auto
5:20:45	STatisfacti0n	this is the battle rifle
5:20:45	heybojo	is the aim assist that good on controller?
5:20:46	dweevers	GFYMeowMix draw keeps us though!
