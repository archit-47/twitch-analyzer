1:23:12	i_AWP	Early faceit was brutal for me, but it balances the teams and gives you some level 5-8 players usually - watch what they do. You should always try to learn something every game - in silver mm it’s just nonsense gameplay @bluehipp0

7:51:05	kingvikingstein	I mean won't you have to wind up making two groups of friends though to some extent, as you'll have your faction friends you can actually clear world content with, and then raid cotent with both your faction and friends
7:51:06	bohan_	theyre just blurring everything together. no class has its own identity anymore
7:51:17	EscaIate	my interpretation was that it was for alleviating finding groups for content

7:51:46	hobrev	I think in terms of active players FF is bigger
7:51:47	Floofys	Does WoW have good player owned housing like Star Wars Galaxies yet?
7:51:48	LowRatedHighlander	so it might have overtaken them
7:51:51	Mr_Motumbo	Never heard of either of those games, all I know is Runescape ;)

7:52:40	BozzyRL	is the match not on HLTV? Cant find anything about ESEA Advanced on there
7:52:58	chianti96	FF is huge here in Italy rn Kappa
7:53:01	kingvikingstein	Oh yeah entirely different between classic and modern, my favourite recent expac was MoP for how much the classes felt distinct
7:53:08	hobrev	everyone can do pretty much everything
7:53:08	devourerplz	@chianti96 KEKW
7:53:10	praeter15	borpaSpin
7:53:11	bohan_	remember when half the classes couldnt.. like.. heal...
7:53:16	KhollMS	Can just use drums in classic kekw
7:53:17	PaladinXyzz	Yea that's why only playing tbc classic atm
7:53:18	kingvikingstein	and then I remember MoP is a decade old
7:53:30	gobbybraves	nailed it. now it just feels like some sort of phone mobile video game where you just buy up your skills.
7:53:42	hobrev	monks being able to do literally everything was just the beginning :D
7:54:07	pigawn	they replaced those with the 5% buffs that certain classes give (mage,priest,monk,dh,warrior)
7:54:11	Kurintoi	it broadens the character you're but it feels your arent unique
