0:43:16	Ravi3ate	In astrology, Gemini is often regarded as a sign that's two-faced and duplicitous, flighty and indecisive. But that oversimplification and, honestly, unfair categorization doesn't tell the whole story of Gemini personality traits. If you're an all-star Gemini, you already know this, though.

To have a more accurate sign reading look up sidereal astrology. Finding your ascending/rising sign is more personal than your Sun and Moon since it takes your time and location of birth into account.
