1:02:56	GeorgeLincolnRockweII	Niko IGL LUL
1:02:58	gabagoolx	feel like aleksi's current team to g2 would such a substantial difference. aleksi was super hand holdy and micromanaging in OG
1:02:58	arielenriko	@mbie1sa i dont think olof is much plopski, which means you would rather prefer to keep plopski than picking up olof
1:03:00	john17650	cant do that with niko for sure

1:03:13	kingkwaku_	Aleksi has proved nothing I don’t get why they want to bring him in so overrated
1:03:13	ItWentRome	"they will do good until they wont" LUL
1:03:18	dcn1ghtwing	personally i think aleksi is overrated as an igl. he relies too heavily on gimmicks and gambles on ct side
1:03:21	Trojan_SK	KodaRG POGGIES
1:03:29	Mr_Gatler	alexi puts himself in quite a few star roles doesn't he? it's gonna be hard with niko monesy and hunter there lmao

1:08:11	jdmf98	@fl0m what about expectations from m0nesy in G2?
1:08:11	JFizzlestein	Stew to Astralis cause he wants to kiss k0nfig Kreygasm
1:08:11	k1ngse7en	Complexity can reform the old 100Thieve/Renegades (jks/jkaem/lias
1:08:13	bigfani	ASTREwastaken yeah
1:08:14	Catts	i hope things go well for auti and rush, they deserve it
1:08:16	caraigggg	@fl0m who's going to be IGL on EG if that happens
1:08:17	Stogie6	No way this man is worth $35 million and he drinks from a damn solo cup KEKW
1:08:18	sjoerdtheman	macien124 you just saw the thescore vid didnt you?
1:08:21	007deman	Who's going to sign the Chococheck roster
1:08:22	LowRatedHighlander	@astrewastaken yes
1:08:23	andrewmedaTV	@kingkwaku_ Mantuu, an unproven "top 10" awper. flamez, and unproven tier 2 player brought into a tier 1 team. Valde, very much a good player. The players may be good on their own but not in Aleksi's system. It happens sometimes. Just isn't the right fit and should in no way take way from Aleksi as an igl...certainly a step up from Nexa
1:08:26	ASTREwastaken	shit is there a clip or something?
1:08:27	BuSheeZy	@ASTREwastaken he just talked about it for like an hour, yeah
1:08:31	priiide_	i thought naf resigned
1:08:33	gLH_TV	@fl0m and VINI he might join an international roster
1:08:35	ASTREwastaken	damn just missed it
1:08:35	s1mply_ant	Imagine a Cold furia move if Vini leaves

Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant

3:33:24	BeauxGnar	mac10 strats
3:33:25	NibletTide	@LowRatedHighlander I agree with that, but in terms of TTK (if you hit all shots), they're identical
3:33:30	Madfish2021	Choo Chooo HypeHands2
3:33:30	l3ordon	Valorant is a complex video game of skill, talent, intelligence, and accuracy. it just HAPPENS to also be animated. CSGO is simply just inferior.
3:33:31	apoodle10	didn't this guy dodge a game on multiple occasions already? i don't understand how teams keep picking someone with that kind of history TacticalAlmonds
3:33:36	splitzky__	should I play csgo or pokemon go fl0m? monkaHmm
