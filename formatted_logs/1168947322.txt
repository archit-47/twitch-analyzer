0:32:59	Archit47	A vignette creates a subtle frame around your subject, helping to place more focus on the important part of the scene. Vignetting can work particularly well if there are distracting or unimportant elements around the edges of the frame. The vignette draws the viewer's attention away from these areas of the image.

2:35:54	AFugy	About 2 years ago my family went to visit my sister in LA. One day while we were there I got roped into watching my niece in a hair salon while my sister got her hair done. So I'm sitting in the salon lobby, bored as fuck, watching my niece and who walks in but EliGE from Liquid. At first I was kind nervous and freaked out, I'd just kinda glance at him every now and then, trying not to freak him out. But then my fucking niece starts crying and fidgeting and shit and won't shut up. So I'm trying

2:36:47	curpyx	So I'm trying to keep my niece quiet and not bother EliGE, when oops, too late, he gets up and walks over to us. He just smiled and stroked her hair, and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn't know. Then he looked at me with those penetrating blue eyes and simply said in that soothing voice "She seems like she's hungry." Then he lifted up his shirt and breastfed my niece right there in the salon lobby. Really nice guy.

4:24:58	npcACTUAL	damn just got here it looks like everything is being passed through a blue filter LUL
4:25:06	Zeyzo_	pepeSus my beta says its running but its really not
4:25:12	LowRatedHighlander	@justninth everyone‚Äôs passwords are compromised
4:25:15	LowRatedHighlander	So yes
4:25:18	phatassdog	@zthrice ah gotcha that makes me a little concerned but ima probably buy this game still
4:25:25	LowRatedHighlander	A little bit of a big deal.
4:25:28	MisonS2	just make sure you have 2FA and change your password
4:25:33	curpyx	The big deal is that ERob's viewership really be hating him and his payout show that smh Sadge
4:25:35	MattMeeko	SSNs could have been stolen
4:25:37	zThrice	phatassdog whats concerning about it? I think it adds a cool element to gameplay
4:25:42	nanerpus_	also remember, this leak was just titled "Part 1"
4:25:43	dd2331d	Some people just want to see the twitch burn
4:25:46	npcACTUAL	yeah, just changed password and added 2FA. y'all should do so as soon as you can
4:25:51	Archit47	twitch has a lot of proprietary software for streaming that is a bigger loss
4:25:53	LowRatedHighlander	The earnings is stupid and shouldn‚Äôt even be a surprise
4:26:01	zThrice	yeah now we will all see that fl0m makes less than a Costco Employee
4:26:08	BinaryHorizon	Yeah I like being a shitter and no one knowing who I am
4:26:10	Dsharper	@fl0m but now some people will be able to look up your last name erik Kappa
4:26:10	BinaryHorizon	LUL
4:26:16	FenceTTV	@LowRatedHighlander and thats after twitch takes 50%
4:26:16	thegreatfoo	@zThrice ooof
4:26:23	dd2331d	What'd you change it to? we need to make sure it's safe Kappa
4:26:26	bolottekid	HACKERMANS
4:26:26	billballbowl	It's okay, we all knew you weren't in the top 100
4:26:27	Archit47	enable 2FA
4:26:27	invisibor	I‚Äôm a teacher.  My salary is public record.
4:26:30	ste3lhead	you're a top 100 earner in my heart @fl0m

4:26:43	dbz1h	i have mixed feelings about anonymity on the interwebs
4:26:46	CosmicQc	Is this COD? lol
4:26:51	Qvingvi1	Is this a new game?
4:26:52	avorix_	Wow that death camera looks really gross
4:26:55	FenceTTV	did anyone else expect it to be more or just me
4:26:56	LowRatedHighlander	Aight maybe my boomer came out a bit
4:26:58	npcACTUAL	Avg Twitch viewer: BabyRage Oldest Juicer: BabyRage
4:27:07	bolottekid	BabyRage
4:27:12	crocswsocks	boomer
4:27:13	Nightbot	hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
4:27:38	curpyx	I MEAN BUT EIGHT MILL
4:27:57	crocswsocks	8 mil was over 2 years though
4:27:59	cdm_	yeah...whats the net benefit for amazon
4:28:00	npcACTUAL	juiceman gets at least the same amount in donos tho, and thats not including sponsorz
4:28:03	BinaryHorizon	8 mil over years
4:28:08	cdm_	they making more than the individual
4:28:10	bolottekid	yeah like imagine singer performing infront of thousands of ppl, while fl0m do that shit everyday
4:28:11	curpyx	Yeah I get what you mean but thats expected cause his viewers are like 11
4:28:16	apoodle10	yeah, i hope not a lot of people end up getting doxed over this leak
4:28:18	dd2331d	8 million from twitch, not counting sponsors and all the other income sources @fl0m
4:28:18	nanerpus_	and doesnt include donations
4:28:18	dbz1h	agreed but a lot of the "people that suck" on the web are hiding behind that anonymity
4:28:22	CharlieElm	That's more than people make in an entire lifetime
4:28:27	JustNinth	I changed my pw and enabled two factor authenticator. As soon as i asked you about twitch @fl0m  some random account followed me. Spooky shit
4:28:28	FenceTTV	thats why streamers take ads and stuff. they pay well
4:28:31	redsox4evur	but how much did he get in donations? monkaHmm
4:28:33	billballbowl	I mean if someone offered me just 80k per year to play video games all day I would quit my job right now
4:28:34	AFugy	that 8 mil doesn't cover all the money he is making tho
4:28:36	crocswsocks	CharlieElm life ain't fair
4:28:37	Moobot	Fl0m is now sponsored by Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs. Yes he really gets paid to eat hotdogs. Use the link below to find Nathans's Famous Hot Dogs in a store near you! bit.ly/GlizzyFl0m

4:28:44	T8_Legend	@fl0m whats your fps? Is this running well? I was getting 80-90 w/ a 3090 =[
4:28:49	curpyx	Whats actually nuts is the gambling sponsor payout leaks, I knew they paid fat but I did not think it was THATTTT fat
4:28:50	EthanAtor95	weird to imagine that is the peak of the profession. I always imagined it would be way moree than that
4:28:52	LowRatedHighlander	Where is sleepy
4:28:53	swatd3ath	Thats why Everybody is leaving twitch because People aren‚Äôt making the money they deserve
4:28:55	StatusLive	@AFugy not just playing video games all day
4:28:58	npcACTUAL	Shooting at nameplates not players KEKW

4:30:03	About40Midgetz	Feels like hardline
4:30:06	WookiePotamus	@fl0m what you are experiencing is actually the Anti cheat doing its job. since you have Name Lock active the server isn't making your bullets hit and causing you to die if you toggle off the game will improve smileW
4:30:07	bolottekid	1TAP
4:30:09	sphhax	oh yeah this server is scuffed my game was fine before this
4:30:11	yobtih	Crungo

4:30:21	bolottekid	@fl0m what you are experiencing is actually the Anti cheat doing its job. since you have Name Lock active the server isn't making your bullets hit and causing you to die if you toggle off the game will improve smileW
4:30:23	Zekkenn_	I dont know if its the server or what but the time to kill in this game seems really high
4:30:39	redsox4evur	@fl0m what you are experiencing is actually the Anti cheat doing its job. since you have Name Lock active the server isn't making your bullets hit and causing you to die if you toggle off the game will improve smileW
