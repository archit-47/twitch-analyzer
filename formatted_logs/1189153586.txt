1:50:45	Nightbot	@Doccy -> The command "!delay" has been edited successfully.
1:50:50	spiddLEz	@M3n0H it wont make them play better just more awake and alert... they will just miss faster
1:50:54	hobrev	it really sucks for michu, he always joins a team either after they have dropped off or when they are already self-destructing
1:50:58	Ra1n1ngDeath	optimistic and delusional are 2 different words @fl0m

2:53:04	PerhapsItsPeach	i've not played in a while, did they buff the fire rate of the m4a1?
2:53:13	Hearte_	If they're worried about bullet count they should try the negev :)
2:53:14	Znowleopard	i still play with the a4, only because i have nice ass skins, then again im not playing the major looool
2:53:14	lavavex	!fedoratip
2:53:15	Jasper2K2K	Are they gonna nerf the a1s or are they gonna try to buff the a4 to balance it out?
2:53:16	Nightbot	NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
2:53:21	Fample	its magixx's a4

2:53:24	djimpopo	no tracers etc
2:53:24	lavavex	Can i get silenced?
2:53:27	splitsky_	pickem in shambles
2:53:29	Rocketgamer102	@PerhapsItsPeach They buffed the damage to 38
2:53:32	bendoverson99	i hate the reload animation on the a1s
2:53:33	lolypop98	and way easier recoil
2:53:34	Spazzocopter	@PerhapsItsPeach better damage, 4 shot to kill at any range
2:53:34	PerhapsItsPeach	Rocketgamer102 i see
2:53:34	Duveranomous	shhhhh @fl0m before they nerf it again
2:53:40	TH0R_95	omg, Heroic are suffering baaaddddd
2:53:44	Fample	chopper just picked it up

2:54:24	bendoverson99	queeekert
2:54:29	numb3r_cs	so that's whats valve gonna do then Doccy
2:54:30	SupraUK_	well that's a rip
2:54:32	Chexsum	tracers are every 3rd bullet so you can still tap into smokes with most rifles
2:54:36	Doccy	the a1 buff actually makes the ct economy and side better
2:54:37	lavavex	Valve needs to buff the Drop rates for cases
2:54:40	Jasper2K2K	Like after the major valve have to nerf the a1 or buff the a4 I feel like because there is no reason not to use the a1 right now
2:54:42	Doccy	i mean
2:54:45	AverageMauo	Heroic trolling
2:54:50	Doccy	we don't need to have the a4 beviable
2:54:54	nirubi_	I got that clip
2:54:56	sjoerdtheman	yeah he shat on them
2:55:01	Doccy	not every gun is supposed to be viable

2:56:11	lavavex	Tech timeout? did someone throw their mouse and keyboard cross room?
2:56:14	mayor_RO	i want heroic to play good at least stavn i trust stavn
2:56:19	Doccy	if we want to go down this path of having both be useful
2:56:22	SupraUK_	so if astralis v heroic play and VP win, my pickems are saved
2:56:22	Ra1n1ngDeath	@Justhoohaa no you are a beautiful motherf*ker
2:56:26	spiddLEz	@chexsum so everyone loads their clip with a “yellow bullet” every 3rd bullet? Is this what you’re telling me? Valve really is dumb
2:56:33	Jasper2K2K	what nerf could they even do to the a1? just revert it back to being normal? i feel like that's boring. just buff the a4 rof to be even more lol ez balance
2:56:36	Doccy	we need to make the a1 and a4 useful in the exact opposite situations

4:35:40	V1ZzxX	why people like mirage
4:35:45	Shotgun_Chef	@fl0m why not just add new maps to the pool at the major :)
4:35:46	themayorfromjaws	poolday when
4:35:46	virajsh98	@sjoerdtheman yeah they should but with the new collection for that one, they won't let go of the cashflow
4:35:47	LowRatedHighlander	Remove mirage and sauceboy is in shambles PepeHands
4:35:56	yobtih	what are your thoughts on keeping maps cause casual players only play them? Mirage/Dust2? Most casual players (not the game mode the player type) just spam Mirage cause they know it
4:35:57	yaJgnizamA	peepoGiggles
4:35:57	sealer9	i hate when events have show matches like the did with cache and tuscan but then nothing comes out of it. stop fucking giving me blue balls

4:37:38	BoftinRowswell	Unpopular opinion, I kinda like basalt I think with a few reworks it could be viable competitively
4:37:42	Aux_Bus	i like the idea of pro teams playing maps they dont have completely dialed in

4:37:50	freddie_from_mercury	Or Bring back de_Season
4:37:52	sjoerdtheman	having a map out of rotation wouldnt have any effect to the casual playerbase tho
4:37:52	Rocketgamer102	Bring Back Biome
4:37:57	haprd	teams could have 2 perma bans
4:37:58	LowRatedHighlander	Basalt is definitely interesting
4:38:00	Rocketgamer102	or de_season
4:38:02	heyitstiesey	monkaHmm
4:38:07	sjoerdtheman	as long as its still playable in MM
4:38:07	LowRatedHighlander	Def needs work still but I like the base concept
4:38:09	Shotgun_Chef	@fl0m why not just change the pro level map pool and keep d2 mirage for MM?
4:38:11	artmuller	9 maps and every game is a Bo5, gg
4:38:13	yobtih	I'd be curious to see what the devs think about when adding a map. Do they look at everything all the way down to queue times for MM or are the focused purely on playablility
4:38:14	TheJayLatte	i miss zoo
4:38:15	ananas197	or on a rotation
4:38:18	blankdeck31	@fl0m make the games amp pool 9 but the active tournament pool 7 of 9
4:38:21	Jaseto88	Fl0m I have a revolutionary idea, a map with 3 bomb sites, and another map with a zip line fl0mBOOBA
4:38:21	freddie_from_mercury	@LowRatedHighlander I actually really been enjoying basalt
4:38:28	krane151	LUL
4:38:29	V1ZzxX	ikr
4:38:29	philsl3ury	What about removing one of the three pillar maps and one ancillary map during each one? that way we always have 2 of the 3 pillars in the format?
4:38:30	V1ZzxX	same
4:38:30	virajsh98	let both teams ban 2 maps before picking one for a bo3
4:38:45	LowRatedHighlander	@freddie_from_mercury it can be fun sometimes but def needs some work here and there

5:46:05	SupraUK_	!eu
5:46:05	Nightbot	EU MM is easier because it works as intended. NA MM is more difficult because there's a higher proportion of cheaters and rank disparities make games difficult due to a smaller player base.

5:51:28	Nightbot	There is no delay between us and fl0m. Between fl0m and the stream he is watching is a 2 minute delay. He does it this way so he can interact with us and abide by the guidelines
5:51:29	DavieWhy	what a riot
5:51:31	nanerpus_	My mm elo got super fucked at one point too years ago. At DMG I won 23 games in a row at one point, all even or positive, and didn’t rank up
5:51:35	yobtih	Riot is like the controlling girlfriend who is super fucking hot but like please let me hang out with theboys
5:51:38	n0r13k	I think people have also gotten a lot better at the game. I played EDL in 1.6 and wasn't ever a struggler, but I recently found a demo and the game has a lot more depth than it used to. You play against GN4s that know how to execute both sites. It's wild.
5:51:40	sjoerdtheman	its_gelly i paid money for that shit tho monkaHmm

5:52:27	SternXP	look at League of legends soloqueue it's even worse than an fps mm system cause you get a bunch of people hold your games hostage. no way Val would be any different

5:55:27	chezblaze	Franchising may hurt Val?
5:55:28	yobtih	Valorant has to preform, Riot can't waste the time/money on it cause they only have 2 games
5:55:29	hobrev	they will be very different as games too, knowing how likely it is that the heroes and abilities become more powerful as the game gets older and they run out of basic hero archetypes

8:04:39	muddychor	is there a curse in csgo like 9-3 curse in valo
8:04:40	KonShika	i feel like there should a threshold to use the feature
8:04:42	frogoree	literally only the biggest streamers benefit from this...
8:04:42	ShadeAndBade	@fl0m if Mouz and Astralis both win Astralis will play Spirit and Mouz will play BIG. If Pain wins then Mouz will play spirit upon a win and if Renegades wins then Astralis will play BIG upon a win. And if neither Mouz or Astralis win Heroic plays RNG, Spirit play Movistar, and Pain plays BIG.
8:04:43	Jaseto88	Bigger streamers can use alt accounts and pay for their own boost
8:04:44	gg_leuke	NebChilly what is an instagram influencer then
8:04:46	dbleday	@fl0m it's just spreading cheeks instead of clapping them feels sadge
8:04:51	Chexsum	theyre basically legitimising this
8:05:00	Widepw	@fl0m lets look on a bright side, trolls will now not only call streamers washed up, they will also call them boosted
8:05:04	ShockWeasel	according to the page about boosting on twitch it'll use channel points not money
8:05:06	daba_roux	twitch just wants more money for themselves
8:05:06	basedjumper	They might see short term results but that won't last and they'll buy more like the addicts they are. Example A- fl0m
8:05:12	naMas000	fl0m's beard cost chat 5$ a stream.. COME ON CHAT.... do it ! :D
8:05:15	Killer_Panda2k11	Basically Twitch is trying to get as much money as they can to keep sending Bezos to space
8:05:17	Huddlesworth	a threshold or a limit?
8:05:19	dr_p_za	makes sense tho, you can advertize your buisness, right>
8:05:22	NebChilly	@gg_leuke im talking bout twitch insta is a different cest pool
8:05:24	xSimjw	wtf is mouz's logo...
8:05:25	yavin04	big streamers usually alredy say dont give me money so i dont think they would ask viewers to pay for them
8:05:26	Huddlesworth	why not limit it to smaller channels only
8:05:26	jokkerbo	credit score
8:05:27	bigbubbadave	recommendations in general promote usually do that. Recommendations are partly based on general popularity.

9:22:30	Ta_Lor	chargers left their fanbase in san diego

9:22:32	wallmanm	Mouz have no direction feelsbadman
9:22:33	caffeinetx	The browns fans didn't go anywhere. They just didn't want to overpay for NFL tickets for a losing team. Them bitches expensive
9:22:38	Demea_	hard to justify dropping hundreds of dollars to go see a team that's probably gonna get creamed, especially if you have kids.

10:20:09	McBubba03	Liquid to New Champions pokiCheer

10:20:59	Speedrulez	dev1ce speaks swedish he used to have a swedish girlfriend
10:21:01	YourCue	i feel like ropz to faze will make twistzz take a back seat as a star, which will be sad
10:21:07	Speedrulez	dev1ce speaks swedish he used to have a swedish girlfriend pedeso
10:21:25	matty_phresh	@pedeso i think he knows swedish. his gf is swedish
10:21:27	Nightbot	There is no delay between us and fl0m. Between fl0m and the stream he is watching is a 2 minute delay. He does it this way so he can interact with us and abide by the guidelines
10:21:28	ElaD_O	It would be a mistake for ropz to transition into olif's role. it would only make sense if someone changes their playstyle
10:21:41	Cahman	Grim came after twist left?

10:22:06	daba_roux	i thought
10:22:08	LowRatedHighlander	And then twist left a little while after
10:22:08	Cahman	Ohh
10:22:09	Speedrulez	the only player i think he could change for is Rain and that would be a mistake fl0m (or olof but that would be even more stupid)
10:22:16	apoodle10	unless you get esetag for free, and then get to sell him to cloud9 for a nice profilt

10:41:11	TyphloMusic	it would boost the game tho, source will bring the hype, even tho its not a huge change
10:41:12	Speedrulez	fl0m calling a question about source 2 a good question... how is down bad ....
10:41:15	iizarian	obviously what mm needs is 256 tick
10:41:16	Jaerdekartt	demo ui

10:41:19	senorvac02	cs just feels cluttered compared to dota
10:41:20	Nightbot	There is no delay between us and fl0m. Between fl0m and the stream he is watching is a 2 minute delay. He does it this way so he can interact with us and abide by the guidelines

10:41:31	JakestersLab	@Speedrulez I'm saying there is a setting in gotv to enable observed player crosshairs, looks like fl0m has that turned on
