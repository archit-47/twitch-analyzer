0:56:35	Pojjy	Any fork-knifers in the chat modCheck
0:56:37	FlameyKumori	That's a big reason I don't like "Hero shooters" like Overwtach, Valorant or Rainbow 6. The super powers the characters have will just eventually ruin the game and often times breaks shit as the devs just constantly struggle to balance 7+ characters and various powers.

0:57:09	zThrice	I grew up with N64 games, if your game didnt work, oh well
0:57:14	Naitbait04	the reason I still play csgo is because they never update it
0:57:14	motm	Developers are scared to make their own game, follow a new vision. Devs are stuck in a loop where they copy what has worked for others. There is a serious lack of Originality.

0:57:58	slimrick6	My first game I can remember was call of duty 2 and I played it for years
0:58:01	LowRatedHighlander	There’s a reason why Indie games blow up and it’s because they’re the only ones actively exploring what hasn’t been done yet

4:45:04	STatisfacti0n	@LeBoomstickPBP it's hard for me to pinpoint but I think for me is that after he gets back out of the Matrix, it's still trying to basically just rehash the same shit from the first movies, including the flashbacks and scenes from those movies. Like I understand he's supposedly been stuck for the last 60 years but once he's woken back up and remembering, we should be seeing an unstoppable Neo imo
