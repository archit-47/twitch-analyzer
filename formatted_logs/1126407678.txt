0:17:19	LowRatedHighlander	!jdubs3
0:17:31	djues333	I first met Johnny on November 11th, 2018. I never thought that he was capable of something like this, I would say this first started when he berated me in pugs when I jumped on sandbags in a very important clutch round, and when I missed the Furia smoke on inferno and many many more. Although I've known Johnny for years now as well as being considered a close friend, with all these allegations being brought to light I cannot protect him any further...
0:17:31	DullaTPG	this kid is lying, he said he first met johhny a few days ago and later on he says "I first met Johnny on November 11th, 2018" i am ready to cancel him peepoRiot
