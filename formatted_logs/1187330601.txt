2:06:03	Nightbot	936p provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown; however, it was causing issues with fl0m's resolution, so he switched to 1080p.

2:06:07	xNazguls	ACTUALLY THO @abrade1
2:06:08	jowen27	!encoder
2:06:08	Nightbot	H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)

2:24:13	the_scrash	@NikolaJanevYT I know but its probably pointless because they are only BO1s so the teams would have to switch in the arena every 50 or so minutes, plus its quite early so not that many people in the crowd
2:24:15	im2meta4u	If you really want to live stream 4k video, doing it at 30 frames per second will require a bitrate between 13,000 and 34,000 kbps. In terms of upload speed, that's 15.8 Mbps and 41 Mbps. To stream 4k video at 60 frames per second, the recommended bitrate range is 20,000 to 51,000 kbps.

4:15:54	ThatFinn	Certain spots you can be spotted if you have silencer vs not having it. ie long corner in overpass
4:15:55	ImTarco	It makes the balancing so much more intricate too. AK = loud, one shot hs, crazy recoil. Silencer = quiter, no tracers, more expensive, not a 1 shot hs, less bullets, slower fire rate, easier to control.

This is a violation to the regulation that every co-streamer needs to use 2:00 delay. Since we are losing money because of this abomination, we decides to revoke your right to co-stream the major.

7:03:20	SorrowInRain	Hello fl0m, this is Dave from PGL. We received a report from your chat that your stream is only using 1:45 delay. This is a violation to the regulation that every co-streamer needs to use 2:00 delay. Since we are losing money because of this abomination, we decides to revoke your right to co-stream the major.

7:35:02	sjoerdtheman	BO9 for all the matches peepoSit
7:35:02	arashtk	maybe BO3 only for quarter finals
7:35:03	G3RONlMO	it just doesnt feel like the best team always wins in a BO1
7:35:03	Uwotm08	I think they're doing very well, delay-wise.
7:35:04	Elcoin11	10
7:35:05	get_rekt211	BO3 will make it tiring for players as well and more imp matches are anyways Bo3 like elemination and advance one
