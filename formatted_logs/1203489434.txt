1:19:54	HotDishMan	Didn't nitro also want to travel less with his 2nd kid coming as well?
1:19:55	cronican	he also kept his rep, instead of going to a premier team for example
1:19:56	thebighump	Do u think it’s because of the na travelling situation in csgo @fl0m
1:19:56	casualcolt	@fl0m not trying to spam just curious, is there a reason the bracket on ibp website is not showing results from yesterday?
1:19:57	apoodle10	nitr0 did the right thing going to valorant, it's better to start working on moving on instead of potentially languishing in the na landscape for the foreseeable future

Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic..

1:31:12	3ftTall	If I didn't want to have a player cam, I would just get it setup with a Marshawn Lynch mask and a little sign that says. "I'm just here so I won't get fined"
1:31:17	akazplays	imagine wanting to be pro and not be seen LOL
1:31:23	ChaoticRenny	I mean look at fl0m it's not in the way and I don't see up his nose
1:31:30	sloveCS	it would be like the major where you can see the player cam when the player is being observed
1:31:36	G3RONlMO	wear a mask obv
1:31:39	ImTarco	"Please don't point camera at me, thx :) "

1:43:53	l3ordon	How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a "bomb"? Instead of abilities they have "nades mollies and smokes". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this

2:22:35	Nightbot	STatisfacti0n Cool! I thought I would meet like minded people to discuss NA CS in this chat. Guess you’ll just remain jackasses who want to promote their own propaganda instead of discussing pertinent issues. Cool, I’ll leave if these moderators are just dumb. Peace out.
2:22:40	LowRatedHighlander	His request said this
2:22:41	LowRatedHighlander	!stat3
2:22:42	Nightbot	Mod was quite unreasonable to talk about NA CS scene. Seems just like another 14 year old on twitch who just wants everyone to type KEKW everytime.... If these are the types of mods (and consequently goes higher up in food chain and extends to fl0m), give me permaban and I won't even bother watching this stream ever again.

4:20:53	senorvac02	NIP were number 2?
4:20:56	memecabinetdan	tbf dude was on heroic for like 3 years and then the astralis moment happened

4:21:34	chr1stos94	- lnz - plopski + any good player
4:21:34	AncientPistoll	if esetag does not go to C9 do you think Astralis would not implode?
4:21:34	EazyyNY	all in to win baby
4:21:36	meguhhd	cleveland did with bron PogO

4:22:21	ConceitedRat	Nitro for Fallen then?
4:22:25	floatline	@AncientPistoll it would've imploded anyway imo
4:22:33	TH0R_95	none offered him a thing man Sadge
4:22:36	l3ordon	Nitr0, stew and fallen to FaZe Pog
4:22:37	senorvac02	was he kicked from liquid or he left
4:22:38	royalthree	@fl0m what do you think about Astralis with konfig and blamef? do you think they can be top 1 again eventually?
4:22:42	moosE3knucklE	i think the Major made alot of people wanna come back CS...
4:22:44	rbxd1234	did this guy just say nitr0 for fallen
4:22:44	zxcRBK	true
4:22:45	tsgkristiz	@l3ordon oh hell no
4:22:48	MadTitan98	EG nitr0?
4:22:49	chr1stos94	NA CS is decaying and everyone is going to valorant
4:22:55	renrike	it could be cool if cs added the same knife animations but for teammates watching you, like the same anims from pov
4:22:58	The_Wombatman	I thought Es3tag played his value up how he played for Ast
4:23:00	glawkscs	so nitro for fallen?
4:23:03	AncientPistoll	nitro coming back to cs and be like: where NA scene? modCheck
4:23:07	ConceitedRat	Fallen is leaving at the end of the year, rumored. So yes, that would open up the awper and partial IGL role

4:23:32	senorvac02	nitro back to liquid?
4:23:32	gweri	Cooper
4:23:34	zubira	COPIUM NA CS scene is alive
4:23:37	l3ordon	I think people think Valorant is bigger than CS and its not
4:23:37	3ftTall	NA CS needed a reset. it was way to crowded of a space that didn't produce the best results
4:23:39	Thugs_Bunny268	who was the 3rd guy?
4:23:39	TH0R_95	crispy onetap
4:23:42	glawkscs	so covid 2020 was a perf year for cs pros to try valorant?
4:23:51	senorvac02	The valorant scene seems so volatile
4:23:51	moosE3knucklE	i mean.. after seeing the Major on LAN... seeing how BIG it was. the fact it peeked at 2 mil... i think that right there is making players wanna come back to CS
4:23:55	uniquify	imagine Tenz back on cs
4:24:08	k1bsTV	It was the opportunities that people chased leaving for Valorant to begin with. For most, it was never about the game.

4:24:18	3ftTall	at the end of the day you just need to pay bills and live where you want to
4:24:26	Fivestaralphasnake	When is the major final?
4:24:27	raindeathroses	did someone say tenz? BatChest
4:24:30	k7ylp	i think we lost tenz and shaz forever though
4:24:33	supra_nightmare	Just wait till COVID effects have worn off, its another "Overwatch is going to kill CSGO" story, Overwatch is sitting at half the amount of CSGO players right now
4:24:34	royalthree	@moosE3knucklE personally i feel like that would only have been true for this major and the next major will be much smaller, like back to 1.3 or so.
4:24:35	WoodenBird	@moosE3knucklE the peak was at 2,7 mil I think
4:24:36	chr1stos94	@fl0m but the teams are not at good level right now, top NA team rn is liquid and is not even top 10 whereas a couple years ago you had both NRG/EG and LIQUID top 5
4:24:41	gobbybraves	more of a purge, less of a good thing... more so a clean out.
4:24:42	kplax	Is it true Hiko is coming back to cs
4:24:44	moosE3knucklE	@Fivestaralphasnake you are a few weeks late sir
4:24:44	k1bsTV	@thatonefairkid No chance.

4:24:47	Thugs_Bunny268	mibr got removed right?
4:24:49	vinciCS	tarik tweet wtf KEKW
4:24:55	l3ordon	Wouldn't make any sense for Tenz to come back, no chance
4:24:57	AncientPistoll	It will be years before players who were brought up playing Valorant and love it the way people love VS right now
4:24:59	swizz_801	When does Tarik team play?
4:25:00	Fivestaralphasnake	@moosE3knucklE NIP won

4:25:42	Dir7ycs	hoow is this match goion on?
4:25:46	3ftTall	I look forward to NA cs taking a step up to kind of level with the rest of the world
4:25:47	Fivestaralphasnake	@moosE3knucklE You good people
4:25:50	kplax	is Hiko coming back to cs
4:25:51	faevz	@Arkminer nah he retired a few months ago
4:25:51	crexiad	fl0m where can i see bracket
4:25:55	floatline	@fl0m north america is not a strong enough region to play in isolation (you stopped there)
4:25:55	ConceitedRat	They're #13 now right
4:26:08	royalthree	i think the viewercount this major was inflated because of the huge wait, navi being so dominant, etc. it was like the perfect storm
4:26:17	ConceitedRat	9
4:26:19	moosE3knucklE	Hiko wont prolly come back to CS.
4:26:23	royalthree	i doubt it'll get as high viewership

4:26:38	supra_nightmare	you need talent, not hiko
4:26:39	Restfulweevil65	@fl0m Will they(liquid) start bootcamping in NA again?
4:26:43	AncientPistoll	TBF qualifying for the major is not a flex
4:26:51	chr1stos94	@fl0m  stewie and fallen no? so I am assuming they are not happy with where they are
4:26:51	l3ordon	Is there a reason the start time is so late for this tourney? not hating or being toxic, just curious

4:51:35	Rei_Ayanamiii	im a huge fan of this map personally
4:51:38	vis9ns	NODDERS
4:51:43	supra_nightmare	Refresh on Ancient was epic with the ScreaM moment Pog
4:51:44	LukeryD	@s7nthetik the csgo community has always been conservative when it comes to change
4:51:47	shredder_go	yes 1junior is still contracted to furia as per hltv article about teams shuffle after major
4:51:47	apoodle10	ancient has seen astonishingly few changes so far
4:51:48	sloveCS	just makes me want more new maps in the map pool
4:51:48	TH0R_95	it still need some clean ups with the corners tho, imo, Fl0m
4:51:49	BEIRUIDENG	Vertigo or Ancient better? @fl0m
4:51:50	LucidR9	if it were any more intense we'd be camping
4:51:52	Sealer9	And some insane T side rounds
4:51:53	s7nthetik	MALBS deserves a shot on a tier1 team
4:51:56	Thugs_Bunny268	@fl0m why didnt we have fantasy league for this?
4:51:58	royalthree	i genuinely always liked it, i was super upset when everyone was shitting on it originally. it's had minimal changes
4:52:06	vis9ns	@s7nthetik NODDERS true
4:52:06	Alszak	I didn't play it yet, so I couldn't decide if it is good or bad
4:52:08	TrillMurr	That's probably why I hate it LUL cuz I'm nowhere near top tier player
4:52:12	dims_cs	it's not the best PUG map but people dont want to even try it out before shitting on it
4:52:12	royalthree	but yeah the cs community has HATED whenever ANYTHING gets changed
4:52:13	s7nthetik	@sloveCS bring back old cobble and upgrade a lil bit
4:52:15	uberargyle	@LucidR9 peepoRiot that requires payment
4:52:18	vis9ns	pepeMeltdown
4:52:18	RyanGDS	i may be extremely wrong but i rarely see the T's go A

4:52:27	sloveCS	nah just want new tuscan finished
4:52:34	LukeryD	@fl0m Ancient can be a really good pug map, only 4 places to go on T side
4:52:36	first3h	I mean how bnb can afford to loan junior? How is their financial look like? From what I understand they don’t have org back up
4:52:36	justinimii	Junior legit NA awper right behind our man flom!!
4:52:38	s7nthetik	oooo we do love us some tuscan
4:52:39	sloveCS	or a brand new map
4:52:44	moosE3knucklE	i think Furia just needs to let Junoir go.. i see Furia getting Saffee from Pain gaming.. and then Junior wont play again for Furia. but i just dont see him ever playing for Furia again

4:53:16	TH0R_95	ohhh they have mid monkaW
4:53:22	Terie54	ok thanks,
4:53:28	Shotgun_Chef	@first3h that is prob why furia loaned him, if he does well it keeps his price tag up to sell him
4:53:33	Cacemen	I feel Like even if they don't change anything on the map just having a rotation in the map pool can be so nice. It is better if it is a new map but just changing would be so nice
4:53:34	keetnawilson13	@moosE3knucklE he probably won't but there's not really any reason for them to release him from the contract, they're paying him regardless

5:37:25	elkey1337	Caster what your favourite CIs region player?
5:37:29	alpinestartgate	@fl0m the issue for NIP is not getting another star rifler, that's easy. They need a rifler that speaks Swedish
5:37:35	huronvalley21	k0nfig would've been good
5:37:38	ticklishpanda_1	@fl0m they need malbs KappaHD
5:37:40	elkey1337	@flom

5:38:33	kevinnn713	what are your opinions on liquid?
5:38:40	huronvalley21	NiP has so much potential but yes they need a consistent rifler.  Imagine NiKo and Hunter taking out LNZ and Plopski @fl0m
5:38:40	hemo_tox	Vitality feels like theyre alway competitive, never favorites

5:38:45	Nightbot	dweevers pops a 1deag on diegoga0102 1TAP
5:38:47	chr1stos94	yeah cause they are still doing french only roster where there is not enough firepower in the french scene to be #1
5:38:47	st4sisfield	what change is vitality making?
5:38:48	alpinestartgate	ooof that round was over quick

5:39:25	ekayeem	@st4sisfield +dupreeh, magisk and zonic
5:39:26	lumi1210	they need a keiti
5:39:27	WookiePotamus	@fl0m just get Gelly to be their hype man KEKW
5:39:31	alpinestartgate	@fl0m do you think being able to speak your native language in a team helps you perform better?
5:39:34	vis9ns	peepoSprint
5:39:35	DimitriPascaluta	I still don't think they know who their star player is
5:39:41	LucidR9	nitro - NITROUS, CAR GO

5:39:46	huronvalley21	es3tage I feel isn't the right fit for NIP, but who knows?

5:39:51	Notifly	who do you replace nitr0 for, stew?
5:39:51	webothfab	fallen said in brazilian streams that their style does noit fit too well and they're having a lot of trouble trying to find a balance
5:39:52	vis9ns	@LucidR9 peepoFoil
5:39:59	hemo_tox	JAME TO LIQUID, STOIC RUSSIAN MASTER
5:40:03	figitR6	who would nick replace?

5:40:07	vis9ns	Prayge nitr0
5:40:08	BeauxGnar	Sadge
5:40:11	ChosenDew	@fl0m so nitro is the vtec. without it car go slow
5:40:11	kevinnn713	I haven't heard any rumor  aside from Stew and Fallen possibly leaving.. Are there more?
5:40:12	Chriseh	@fl0m Yeah you can just see it on their faces. Biggest memory is Liquid vs Astralis Q final Berlin right? They picked Vertigo and it looked like their parents took their toys away XD
5:40:12	fate172	@fl0m who goes?
5:40:12	TLsmf	do you think nitr0 is up for the task tho? @fl0m
5:40:15	chesterbeans	liquid is a lambo and nitr0 is a lambo mechanic KEKW
5:40:16	elkey1337	Jame to go save Kappa
5:40:17	LucidR9	yung jon
5:40:19	sylveonkid1	nitro to eg more likely than liquid
5:40:19	Konviction707	@Notifly Fallen if he leaves for a BR team with cold
5:40:22	MVPanda10	N0thing coach?
5:40:22	Rinm	you think was the core
5:40:23	sh1f0	about nip, I think the should stick with this roster, every player has moments of brilliance, and if they keep playing tier one teams they ll be learning too much, if you have confidence in plopski and lnz they can be top 10 players in like a year
5:40:25	BeauxGnar	he dat boi
5:40:27	lumi1210	jojo to liquid to make that clown roll? Kappa
5:40:27	WookiePotamus	@fl0m S1mple back to Liquid HLTV forums confirmed

5:40:33	shakezula_the_mic_rula	ill be surprised if osee stays with extra salt..that team is so trash for all the hype they had
5:40:36	bremey	why couldnt Fallen be the hype man, isnt that why he was added to the team?
5:40:38	SpartanJack_	Liquid need Kings of Content as their roster KEKWOO
5:40:38	Notifly	@Konviction707 would you want nitr0 back on awp?

5:52:18	dweevers	shakezula_the_mic_rula yes... the loyalty is sports where teams cut players instantly or sell them to the highest bidder KEKW

5:53:20	F1niteCS	shakezula_the_mic_rula OMEGALUL loyalty has nothing to do with contracts, transfers, buy-outs, salaries. If the Pats sucked peen after Brady won his first super bowl, bet your ass he's gone because loyalty doesn't exist in buisness

If these are the types of mods (and consequently goes higher up in food chain and extends to fl0m), give me permaban and I won't even bother watching this stream ever again.
