0:36:31	cactusjack480	!dying
0:36:31	Nightbot	Counter Strike Is dying because I can’t get a decent fucking game for the life of me. Ranks are broken everywhere and I’m getting at least one griefer on my team every other game. Matchmaking so unbalanced and I’m including dogshit FACEIT. Really is quite sad how I can’t get decent games
0:36:34	starz_nz	hopefully they open up more servers in the next few days :D
