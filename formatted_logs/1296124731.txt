1:21:30	BrotherJon	Lost Ark story is pretty okay
1:21:50	LowRatedHighlander	i think destiny and dark souls kinda did that right. the lores there if you want it but its always a second thought and never the primary focus when playing the game

1:22:30	BrotherJon	you probably have enough if you got the founders
1:22:36	Puddin_Wing	I mean, the gold standard for "lore that's there if you want it" is witcher 3 surely @LowRatedHighlander
1:22:46	Puddin_Wing	you can spend 100 hours breaking into houses and reading books that have nothing to do with the story
1:22:54	Mentalstatemike	its in the store rn for 1700 of the weird crystal thingies

1:23:36	LowRatedHighlander	Puddin_Wing ok dont hate me but i never played the witcher 3 so it didnt come to mind

1:36:06	LucidR9	Im always the curious as to what the next big reinvention in fantasy will be, everything seems to be tolkien based or tolkien esque, and maybe he got it from somewhere but idfk where you go from there...
1:36:07	mk_48	alternative explanation: the gamedevs did a good job maximizing their potential profit by making the enemies easy enough to not frustrate the absolute casual which in turn puts that crowd of players into a spending mood
