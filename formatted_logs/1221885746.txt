2:44:42	justdanny	Hi, I'm Elige. I like a structured, well planned out system when I play counter strike. I keep my emotions in cool, even in the highest pressure situations. I work best with people similar to me. I think Shox would be a great addition because he is also a very unemotional person, and certainly doesn't get heated when he plays.
2:44:50	bigfani	i think theyre cheating NODDERS
2:44:51	sphhax	they are just better
2:44:53	AIR02000	is guardian a coop mode?
