0:35:49	Doccy	@d0rmant because he is a pacifist
0:35:50	Shotgun_Chef	@Bucke_R6 pug usually is just like a normal faceit free game
0:36:04	Nightbot	Latest video: What Happens When fl0m LOSES his MIND on Inferno... - https://youtu.be/RncIK2_pcVk
0:36:04	LeBoomstickPBP	@bucke_r6 its much more of a hodge podge of players with only the Faceit elo on the line
0:36:05	Shotgun_Chef	@Bucke_R6 but it just means pick up game.
0:36:08	apoodle_	a pug is just another name for a competitive game with randon people, generally on faceit Bucke_R6
0:36:10	SoporificPanda	i would say fpl is still a pug system . it is just more exclusive
0:36:15	Doccy	@Bucke_R6 do you know what mm is
0:36:19	billballbowl	@Bucke_R6 He did answer. Basically if you're not in an official competitive match or in a skrim as a team, you're in a pug. FPL is all pugs but there is money involved
0:36:21	don_10killer	is that papito as your steam pic???
0:36:22	Doccy	a pug is the same as mm
0:36:37	Doccy	MM games are pugs

0:37:20	Doccy	pug is just a term for a game that is started by a group of random people or with friends.
0:37:31	Stevo_Xgaming	just better with the p250
