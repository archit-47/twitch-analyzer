0:47:00	Nightbot	936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.
0:47:01	GreenPhoenix044	OG are mediocre
0:47:02	justj4y666	nice
0:47:02	adipose_man	OG need consistency
0:47:02	hobrev	niko is probably the weakest player on the roster, but he isnt also required to be a star on this roster
0:47:06	sanchit47	widepeepo
0:47:08	fredrcs	look at karrigan tweet thread fl0m pls
0:47:17	MagikAhrim	has lucky been awping this whole event so far?

1:02:31	Dynamo_Dave	After a good game in csgo, i added fl0m because he seemed like a cool guy. We got chatting, over the next couple of months we became good friends. Lots of banter, lots of great CS and most importantly true friendship. I invited him to my house for a csgo lan party. He said he was coming so i was looking forward to meeting him in real life. When he arrived at my house, he pushed me against the wall and started nibbling my ear. Turns out he was vegan. Don't trust this guy.
1:02:35	Nightbot	We're getting animated sub emotes! But we need suggestions for what you want to see. So we created a form to put your suggestions in: https://forms.gle/3C4sk96BZDdnE1bHA Your suggestion can be wholly original or based on/a rework of an existing emote.
