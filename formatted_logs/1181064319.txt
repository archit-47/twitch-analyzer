0:26:25	m4lki3r	However, it is not just the words said during the conversation, but the timing, tone and intent that comes through when actually listening to it that are compelling for me. This conversation, initiated by Mr. Petersen and recorded by him in July of this year (after Mr. Petersen became aware that ESIC was investigating his sharing of Heroic’s data) without Mr. Kristensen’s knowledge or permission, shows only two things of relevance to me:
0:26:27	theliarman	@kn0wie on the raised edge i think
0:26:29	m4lki3r	First, that Mr. Kristensen is being set up to aid Mr. Petersen’s agenda to cause harm to Heroic and, second, that Mr. Kristensen assumes, without knowing, that his former teammates knew about the spectator bug at the time of those matches more than a year
0:26:32	vinciCS	%? all of chat are peepoFoil
0:26:32	nanerpus_	You people realize Hunden would have given every single bit of evidence he had to screw them over right? If there was literally anything we would have seen it

0:27:33	errorCS_BM	semphis clearly explained how 3 out of 5 members knew  the info day before yesterday
0:27:41	felibelii	Stavn apparently was scared to just go outside normally cuz in denmark esports is big and everyone could potentially call him cheater and laugh at him cuz thats the "Public opinion" its crazy .. @fl0m
0:27:46	yobtih	I've seen enough evidence to make a statement. I believe without a shadow of a doubt that this all happened because they are danish. I think what needs to happen is we bar the whole country from the major as punishment

0:30:33	theliarman	@FrostedAlibi nah coach bug was used in 2017....this happened because hunden is a piece of shit
0:30:48	Killer_Panda2k11	I just wanna know if Heroic the org will get in trouble for making the players sign NDAs for the Hunden cover-up?
0:30:51	kn0wie	The boost is for a better view right?

0:31:44	Zardoze	imagine if this is how people really talked lol
0:31:46	nanerpus_	People dont understand that Hunden wanted to do nothing more than try and create this doubt, which is why he only released tiny out of context snippets and said that someone was helping him with no evidence. And chat is basically proving his tactic worked

0:32:34	vinciCS	actually bizarre to me that people think the crying is fake. How emotionally deprived and dead inside are you to think that crying is not a natural and expected reaction to the stress that comes with being falsely accused. Especially if the community is berating you without any actual facts
0:32:47	007deman	@cake315 Yeah people will find ways to hate any team, this video wont change that

0:47:47	nanerpus_	@andrewmedaTV right, and IIRC it is because astralis were trying to make them give the coaches more power in game
0:47:48	so4pybox	id say the c word but dont know if thats allowed here

0:49:14	nanerpus_	@andrewmedaTV I didnt say they liked coaches before hand, but they tolerated them. When they started demanding more they just cut it off
0:49:14	bananasinpajamas_	I'm 25 and I still need an adult for some decisions

[2] Additionally, HUNDEN received a five Major ban in January 2021 from Valve due to exploiting the coaching bug. [3] After waiting out ESIC's ban, he came back from inactivity to coach Heroic once again in April 2021, before being terminated from his contract wit

6:17:57	SchlachtanfallTV	hello and schlac4Tanfall from germany
6:18:01	STatisfacti0n	you can try that too but capping it lower will help, especially on maps that aren't super optimized that your PC might struggle consistently running at 400+ FPS
6:18:21	TwindadPvP	I was wondering if it was my cup usage
6:18:26	STatisfacti0n	even a dip from 400 to say 320 will be absolutely noticeable
6:18:37	STatisfacti0n	and will feel really poor

6:21:09	LowRatedHighlander	Idk I’m on mobile so auto mod doesn’t show up for me @cacemen
6:21:20	TwindadPvP	Someone told me too but feel the teleport shit started after that
6:21:31	TwindadPvP	Cause I joined a faceit lobby where a lot of us had high ping
6:21:46	TwindadPvP	So I did that
6:21:48	STatisfacti0n	so the logaddress_add 1 or w/e it is is mostly used if you have the FPS bug
6:21:57	STatisfacti0n	which is when your FPS drops really low and just stays there

6:22:23	STatisfacti0n	so you can type it into the console quick and it usually clears it up but you don't need it in your launch options or autoexec
6:22:26	cagumm	hey fl0m what are yours and get rights favourite green day songs ?
6:22:40	STatisfacti0n	if you've only typed it into your console you're fine

I mean, why would they ever trade their star entry frags budgetwaifu and paapoweird, the #1 Silver IGL WookiePotamus, the people's favorite awper Huddlesworth and the excellent support player AFugy. After all the hard times and 2-0 winstreak i just cant believe Erik "fl0m" Flom (CEO of Team Fl0m) would ever trade his elite roster even after winning the first ever Silver Major
