0:48:01	TH0R_95	yeah, but IF ReZ and Dev1ce show up, and let's say they have some tricks that they didn't use yet, it's game over for G2, or at least I hope so Prayge
0:48:01	Speedrulez	fl0m ill say it once: VP over Heroic at the moment
0:48:01	sinistersixxx	Why would you put Heroic over VP though? @fl0m
0:48:02	tattt000	@fl0m vitality def might win and if NIP beat G2 i think they could beat Heroic
0:48:03	YuutsuUK	NODDERS
0:48:03	obliviatecharm	WTF D:
0:48:04	arcoedgaras	G2 will destroy them
0:48:04	darkioul	in navi vs vitality, it depends upon nuke, if vitality can hang on nuke there is a chance
0:48:06	SABORx	nip has the crowd.
0:48:07	PrehistoricCat	having b1t, s1mple and electronic on the same team playing so well together is mental
0:48:08	Gearslayer360	g2 choke masters tho @fl0m are you willing to risk that?

0:48:14	kensgold	swedish crowd i want nip to pop off
0:48:15	filiduttn	10 min from their HQ
0:48:15	V1ZzxX	NODDERS

0:48:16	lavavex	I have g2 winning major
0:48:16	TestTubeBaba	imagine going against where he isn't the best player on his team LUL that's even more terrifying
0:48:17	Menki_	Why heroic over vp?
0:48:17	ayaz555	nah g2 goes through, trust the numbers, not your guts @fl0m
0:48:17	brolarbear007	oh wow i forgot they have home advantage

0:48:42	ghost9356	kekw
0:48:45	LongRodVonHugeDonger	HEROIC WON THE MAJOR Pog
0:48:46	BizarreMark	Actually fwom trust twitch chat with your pickems
0:48:46	sealer9	NIP over g2 isn't really an upset imo. vp would be the one to choose
0:48:47	Simoxfox	no way heroic wins against VP
0:48:48	PogchampPapii	1 wrong, no diamond coin
0:48:50	Nomality	G2 doesn't seem too on it right now though. i think NiP has it over them
0:48:51	ozzers23	How does map pool affect heroic VP?
0:48:51	Pakz23	I think Heroic can win the major
0:48:53	carboxylate1	@ayaz555 they have only played 4 maps and they looked awful in all the previous tourneys. its def possible SHRUGGERS
0:48:55	PrehistoricCat	heroic is def building speed
0:48:56	officer_ant	True but VP has done so nice upsets in the recent past
0:48:57	vasc5416	heroic gets better every match
0:49:02	xisplo	the crowd is going to pump heroic so much specially with candiaN's energy
0:49:04	Scape000	Heroic is a better team but I could see VP still beating them @fl0m
0:49:04	Meefers	hey I am in the middle of converting cs_italy to a defusal man.  Used the 1.6 colors as well and brightened it up.  I made it a legit comp map and would love to have some people try it out here very soon.  Would you be interested?

1:10:42	c9s1mply	Perfect line up but I was thinking about choosing G2 idk why
1:10:43	M3n0H	it's crazy to say s1mple wasnt navi's best performer
1:10:44	youzucks	gambit navi is such a difficult prediction. Gambit seems to have a stronger map pool against navi and they play well against navi, but navi is on such a roll...
1:10:44	JazzAndRain	Navi consistency loses to gambit @fl0m
1:10:45	rushil_20	did you see floppy destroying team one yesterday @fl0m

1:10:50	raindeathroses	why arent gambit on the opposite side of the bracket to navi :(
1:10:52	Tortoise88	I think it will be g2 Navi in finals, so that whoever wins will get their first major, Niko or simple
1:10:52	yaJgnizamA	h0bbit got 39 kills in reg
1:10:54	misteroncle	gambit will win major

1:12:56	DeoMors	@youzucks Why not? Its been the same storyline, every match people doubt VP and they keep grinding it out just like in Berlin, also its the same core of players improved with yekindar and fl1t
1:12:56	youzucks	heroic has such a strong map pool against VP tho, seems like that will give them the upperhand
1:12:58	Speedrulez	dweevers peepoHappy
1:12:59	2020numbers	they match up but heroic has the upper hand on almost all of them
1:13:05	dweevers	Speedrulez no you KEKPOINT ing me. just my terrible typing skills KEKW

1:13:17	JazzAndRain	@LowRatedHighlander in the last 6 months the head to heasd matchups are consistently in favor og gambit. Im still sending navi tho lol

1:27:54	JazzAndRain	thats tencent talking.... guaranteed
1:27:55	aunathons	im 90% sure thats bc riot doesnt want the csgo sponsor problem w saying "terrorsists cts and bomb"
1:27:56	n0r13k	Imagine being so small minded that you're scared of the mention of a 12 year old game. Really shouts elite mentality.
1:27:58	mastaddragon	mythic in the final?
1:27:59	STatisfacti0n	@seamus_souleater I don't remember his whole fucking long ass name
1:28:01	Madfish2021	a lot of casters and even broky has gambit down as beating NAVI. Its quite possible
1:28:01	Scape000	possible not likely
1:28:01	yungcong	wtf fl0m shaved his beard KEKWait
1:28:02	Kovach01	@fl0m riot has exclusivity over what games their players show on stream. Similar to overwatch league kind of watch dog

1:28:39	XeeVzz	it would be epic that we have same back to back to back LAN finals(kato cologne and the major)
1:28:39	NibletTide	G2 will only lose to NAVI or Gambit
1:28:41	tankwarhead	Yes G2 all the way they re on a tear rn 3-0 grand final tho
1:28:42	sealer9	fl0m moses and henryg are teasing on twitter a henryg return at the major....

1:28:45	sjoerdtheman	heroic vp is such a shit qf tbh, ist going to be good, but i consider them the worst 2 team in the stage after furia
1:28:48	rushil_20	it is @fl0m
1:28:48	whyvaltertaken	Niko is a big name doesnt mean hes theb est player in that team
1:28:49	NebChilly	if Niko's deag can get 4 in a round then they win major
1:28:49	getDense	bro if henryg is at the final and sado can't get there I will be so sad
1:28:49	dankyplanky69	NIP vs G2 is always a 50/50, but becuase NIP has home advantage I think they will win against G2
1:28:49	lawyerpimp	@fl0m I hope that next time the Major will be in TROMSO, Norway -> "The Nothern Light Major"!. I hope you come, Dont need strobe lights then, but you can bring your friend Dillon Francis anyway and he can play uner the nothern light

1:29:15	mortysfatlota	@fl0m would you say gold is guaranteed here fl0mThink
1:29:15	praeter15	fl0m what if Hiko shows up to the major and gives S1mple a hug before the final
1:29:19	M3n0H	basically niko go click heads with deagle
1:29:19	bananasinpajamas_	maybe hiko thought someone meant masters or he just messed it up.
1:29:21	PolynomC	I really like Heroic man.

1:42:15	silviu_cs	Vitality almost took Na`Vi down last time they played @fl0m
1:42:15	justdanny	vitality doesnt have the support pieces to push past navi
1:42:17	c9zzy	struggled against astralis on their worst major
1:42:17	vontaro0	entropiq

1:42:23	TheDojoe	imagine saying "they barely beat astralis" what is csgo these days
1:42:24	M3n0H	gambit beat navi 2-0 at IEM fall
1:42:24	Huddlesworth	YEP a team
1:42:26	ItsJustHenry	Heroic VP will be closeeee imo
1:42:27	TacticalAlmonds	Navi doesn't drop a single map. They don't even let a team get double digits.
1:42:27	OwenChief	@majinluck depends which gambit decides to turn up
1:42:27	kronosentient	@fl0m im praying and just hoping that Navi win it and not anyone else
1:42:29	THR33R	almost lost to EG too
1:42:29	PolynomC	Oh yeah. Enntropiq.
1:42:30	its_gelly	!1deag

1:42:31	B00merson	what if zywoo drops 2 40 kill game
1:42:31	Nightbot	its_gelly pops a 1deag on petkosamoletko 1TAP
1:42:31	vasc5416	the only "risky" match is the g2 nip, so putting heroic in the finals is the safest bet
1:42:32	minded_	@fl0m hear me out, b1t falls to pressure of the crowd and shits the bed and vitality dominates all the way to finals and furia wins it all with art widepeeking zywoo
1:42:35	Thors_Goat	who does the best with the Crowd factor is the question
1:42:37	bobcan1	Entropiq
1:42:38	f3bbs_	i think the winner of the tournament is whoever wins between gambit or navi lol
1:42:40	cyanideaddict_	entropiq?

1:42:42	bobcan1	ENTROPIQ

1:42:45	dankiyy	oh yeah, vit almost lost to eg OMEGALUL
1:42:45	jc409ljc409	Gambit beats NAVI and NIPS beats Gambit for the WIN!
1:42:50	adamhekla98	theeese matces maaaaaan, so hard to predict any
1:42:50	aimen__	i think Zeus has a lot to prove going in against Navi (my opinion)
1:42:50	ayaankhan_786	lost a map to EG
1:42:52	praeter15	dankiyy pepela
1:42:54	Alireza_GM	if Navi loses then the diamond coin is gonna be super rare
1:42:54	vvvespe	Bro if Vitality puts up a fight... ZYWOO vs S1MPLE in front of a crowd that shit's hype
1:42:56	siiiif	minded_ I dont have to imagine, this is going to happen COPIUM
1:42:57	silvernade	True
1:42:57	M3n0H	imagine KEKLEO
1:42:57	Huddlesworth	YEP if he plays better than anyone
1:42:57	HeyImBrim	NiP almost choked so hard yesterday. Flames should have won. I think G2 beats NiP with relative ease.
1:42:58	Madfish2021	CLICK UPDATE PICKS AND WE HAVE THE SAME EZ DIAMOND COIN FOR US FL0M COPIUM
1:42:59	TacticalAlmonds	ZyPoo?
1:43:00	brackufridaybunduru69	yEs :D
1:43:02	MrMonger14	also heroic on stage in the finals would def show up big time. it would be such a good game
1:43:02	kylegrhm	this is my bracket
1:43:02	DimitriPascaluta	you can take them off-guard in the quaterfinal, you can't take them off-guard in the semi or grand final. by then s1mple will have tasted blood.
1:43:02	yungcong	true KEKW
1:43:03	SavouryLobster	waddup mr flume
1:43:04	A_GT86	you think g2 will beat nip and lose to heroic??!
1:43:06	bobcan1	I feel like Vitality had the easiest path into the playoffs
1:43:07	hugejass5	KEKW
1:43:08	tkglog	zyWHO
1:43:09	m0rkyyy	but zywoo hasn't been that so far (against good/in form opponents)
1:43:11	Chumbo767	I wlii give you 10 bucks if navi drops one map the entire playoffs @fl0m
1:43:12	hugejass5	TRUE
1:43:15	kekmann	bruh no chance for anyone bur NAVI, 100%
1:43:16	johnnybigbulge	@DimitriPascaluta are you already writing the script for the major video KEKW
1:43:16	siiiif	if you play better than the other team you will win 4Head
1:43:16	Thors_Goat	it could happen monkaW
1:43:17	td_gg	@bobcan1 what????
1:43:17	j1t5s	if Vitality beat Navi they are winning the major

1:43:19	huronvalley21	yeah your bottom half brother
1:43:20	B00merson	Navi gotta be the champ pick in like 60% of bracckets or more
1:43:24	youzucks	no way he actually picked g2 KEKW
1:43:24	nebel_rock	nah NAVI will win the Major
1:43:25	minded_	that would be the most interesting storyline, navi going out right away
1:43:27	GeorgeLincolnRockweII	Heroic?
1:43:30	SavouryLobster	NiP beats G2 EZ
1:43:31	MrMonger14	yeah but navi went 3-0
1:43:34	dankiyy	navi also is the chokers on semis and gf
1:43:34	cyanideaddict_	@B00merson id go with 80
1:43:35	NotMuerto	the only reason Navi loses this major is if they beat themselves, this is there tourney
1:43:38	21bears	@fl0m if g2 beat nip they 100% beat heroic
1:43:39	GeorgeLincolnRockweII	Heroic didn’t look very good in the last stabe
1:43:39	kylegrhm	@fl0m there is no lower bracket right?
1:43:40	dbleday	Furia is the darkest horse here you never know

2:41:22	AFugy	Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

3:10:46	Nightbot	Fl0m can't shoot people who aren't looking at him. It's a serious disease, and it needs to be addressed, donate now to make a difference in curing whiffingsons. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/779306740
3:10:48	bolottekid	Summary: Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

3:36:16	Madfish2021	I also feel faceit can be a shit show unless you have friends to play with. It’s also toxic asf but the fact you can call in game admin alone makes it better than MM
3:36:16	STatisfacti0n	@iDennz he did. either check earlier in the VoD or wait for the vid to come out in a bit
3:36:17	ignored_val	I play a lot of Dm servers and awp servers because I like my aim being as good as i can get it LUL so I’d say my strong points are definitely my aim and positioning so I’d need to work on game sense the most right ?

3:41:54	lily0uwu	@ignored_val basic ones are must-know; you're going to get wrecked while pushing otherwise. it helps to have a good understanding of nades, both as a solo player and as a team player.
