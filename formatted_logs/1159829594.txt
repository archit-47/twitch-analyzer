2:20:18	GreavenTV	I think Karrigan overthinks it maybe and thinks maybe he can outcall his opponents on nuke
2:20:20	sealer9	they don't really have a perma they kind of just ban maps based on match ups i think
2:20:30	dFab1	They never won at Office and Assault
2:20:33	klaxon419	11-4 most dangerous lead
2:20:36	Paroto7	what is that timing
2:20:39	Jaerdekartt	I wonder why they banned Overpass instead of Nuke
2:20:43	Sem073	yikes
2:20:46	mohammadreza99a	blast has the best production
2:20:54	zefixlikescsgo	why is gtr drunk everyday? PauseFish

2:21:18	LucidR9	NA 's fault
2:21:19	LongRodVonHugeDonger	KEKPOINT FAZE AND INFERNO
2:21:26	GreavenTV	No their perma is Vertigo most of the time, they float it sometimes(like against spirit, who doesn't play it either)
2:21:29	FlameyKumori	But fl0m everyone likes Inferno /s
2:21:32	Jaerdekartt	@LongRodVonHugeDonger Col are good on Nuke. Faze are better on overpass than nuke
2:21:32	ajaxhelios	@fl0m Wouldnt it be better to just yolo another map though since Nuke seems to be instaloss anyway
2:21:42	hobrev	Faze has first banned Vertigo 9/10 of their last matches, the only one they didnt was when OG banned it for them
2:21:46	mohammadreza99a	getting closer and closer to shit time
2:21:49	hobrev	so they definitely have a permaban vertigo

5:39:43	tac0tek	good video
5:39:45	shushi2k	my dad saw apex on my screen and said "you're gonna turn into him if you keep playing this braindead game"

5:41:11	mamluku	not only that , but being in any workplace environment with other people teaches u a lot, and being 16-19 a first time team player is hard @fl0m
5:41:17	theBaboda	@fl0m playing baseball through out my middle school and elemtry school helped me a lot even socially. I learned how to handle being upset with something out of my control and just overall i think it's helped me when i got into esports

5:42:45	Morde24	@M3n0H no one ever sat him on his ass, no setbacks
5:42:50	mamluku	and that maturity is what makes s1mple even greater @fl0m
5:42:52	steelarm77	@supra_nightmare almost as is “chads” were just teen fantasies of successful people LUL

6:02:26	two_drop	@Morde24 the basic idea is that there are two major tax systems in the world: U.S. style (tax all income for citizens or people who earn US income) or international (only tax local income)
6:02:26	SupraUK_	effective tax rate, i guess

6:02:49	two_drop	if you're in an international system, you can shelter a lot of money by setting up corporations that are their own taxpayers
6:02:50	kab1as	To clarify for chat (atleast how it works in France) : Alot of EU countries dont really have methods to tax e-sports winnings. However, winnings have to be taxed since they count as livelyhood. So players have a status called "Auto-Entrepreneur" which basically means they have personal business, and the winnings count as the 'earnings' of that business. That way, the winnings can be taxed, and everything is nice and legal.
6:02:51	supra_nightmare	yea i mean between state and federal i pay 36%

6:03:23	ImTarco	Ah we're back to the memes.
6:03:23	BigWit12	You get taxed in CS, man the economy is a lot more complex than i thought

6:16:32	GenMacAtk	Aren't contracts required to be mutually beneficial? You can't just hand somebody $20 and call the contract valid. They have to be fairly compensated

6:16:42	two_drop	how to pro teams make B executes look so achievable on mirage...?
6:16:43	PerhapsItsPeach	but fl0m even if the players didn;t cheat making them sign an NDA is just smart business, you don't want players doing interviews and saying the wrong thing unintentionally and then bringing more shit down on them
6:16:44	ImTarco	You're not strong, not independent, and you definitely needed a rotate.
6:16:49	so4pybox	very fucked up a big org should never have allowed that its fucking up their reputation

6:17:17	iizarian	yes, that is correct
6:17:18	theBaboda	i certain areas you are in
6:17:18	marcus7445	NDA's only hold up in civil court

6:17:40	shotguhnlive	NDAs rarely hold up in court
6:17:42	mamluku	corporate espionage, patents, or leaking products in general
6:17:42	jaek_iwnl	2v5
6:17:43	nanerpus_	basically all NDAs are pointless in the US
6:17:45	iizarian	some NDA situations are valid for limited periods
6:17:47	priiide_	NDAs have real non sketchy uses. theres just also a lot of sketchy uses
6:17:47	EddieVengeance	oh i didnt know finn became norwegian
6:17:50	M3n0H	big gaming dev companies have NDAs if you leave them
6:17:50	SillyPanda	Also NDA's can't cover illegal activities, which I'm sure their actions would have crosses a few competitive integrity laws
6:17:50	aki_kleist	@fl0m Maybe Heroic need a partnership with Grammarly
6:17:54	iizarian	like for an employee who worked in a semi sensitive roll
6:17:55	ImTarco	NDA's are industry protection tools. Sometimes they're misused, like in Heroic's case.
6:17:58	marcus7445	NDA can also usually be challenged in court
6:18:00	iizarian	you couldn't NDA them for like 50 years

6:19:06	PerhapsItsPeach	go break a proper NDA and then see how much that paper is worth to you, I hate twitch chat lawyers
6:19:07	shotguhnlive	@dolev801 no
6:19:08	two_drop	if NDA's didnt exist, we'd all know about the iPhone 22 by now

6:19:22	Nightbot	Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
6:19:22	GenMacAtk	@owpog You have to or the NDA isn't valid. Contract law in general requires contracts to be mutually beneficial to both parties.
6:19:23	iizarian	but have way more restrictions on the drafter
6:19:25	flattea	can NDAs have NDA
6:19:26	Silkjackel222	@fl0m set up the NDA, I will sign one to get the address to come party Peepo
6:19:34	priiide_	NDAs? more like NBA, yall like basketball?
6:19:36	ImTarco	Probably nap
6:19:36	bobson300101	cum
6:19:37	so4pybox	its like what big movie corporations do when making a movie they have the staff sign an nda so they cant reveal big plot points in the film or tv show
6:19:38	JalapenoJeppe	approve
6:19:39	brownbabby	i'm going to the gamezone
6:19:40	ShiBailey	who wins ancient faze or navi?
6:19:42	Ficii	Like valve is having employees sign nda after leaving the company, that's why people talk about their time at valve years after they've stopped working there
6:19:44	Tettrum	i might act up
6:19:45	b0yadesu	NDA you can't tell people about dropping fake flash tactics
6:19:45	M3n0H	faze on ancient monkaS

6:19:47	Chumbo767	im going to leave
6:19:48	SillyPanda	@iizarian Aren't those illegal at least temporarily rn? I'm pretty sure one of the economic bills passed recently banned non-compete clauses
6:19:51	guzszsz	why is ancient fun to watch?
6:19:51	vinciCS	i'll be stoke for some more tax talk
6:19:52	nanerpus_	NDAs also have a Streisand effect that when you find out there is an NDA regarding something, people assume it is for the worse reasons and it bring more attention to it
6:19:52	EddieVengeance	how is navis ancient? dont think ive watched them on it

7:16:55	Kafkii	And way better
7:17:00	istully	banana farm always op
7:17:02	MaxNoLimits	Why did you place him soo close to the start?
7:17:05	mrtwonenkle	yeah not saying he's the best
7:17:09	sensei_titi	bloon trap in the front is questionable
7:17:10	Bipolarbear_TV	I actually can't believe sauda was stronger than she it snow

7:17:18	dustydumps_	thats what im saying
7:17:20	MaxNoLimits	Oh true
7:17:29	mrtwonenkle	I would use sauda or psi over quincy
7:17:46	dustydumps_	trap is usually for bloon that get through imo
7:18:00	alcatraz1389	i would use psi bcs of range
7:18:06	alcatraz1389	but sauda is pog
7:18:16	mrtwonenkle	spike factory at the end is also good especially permaspikes
7:18:16	dustydumps_	i havent unlocked psi so idk where theyre like
