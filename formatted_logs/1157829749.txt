0:55:55	Ukillay	EARTHQUAKE monkaS
0:55:56	blankdeck31	@fl0m i assume they are not using new update?
0:55:58	Shepdogg77	@billballbowl indeed
0:56:04	RyanGDS	i still dont know what phasing smoke means and at this point im too afraid to ask
0:56:04	Speedrulez	hoohoo checked the penetration of the a1-s it is actually insane fl0m
0:56:05	Exedra711	i hate phasing smoke
0:56:07	MrFortyOz	no one respects smokes in MM makes me mad
0:56:09	beak0_	its better
0:56:12	bluehipp0	@lyted1 it's probably at least equally good "for the price"
0:56:13	NervS	seeing 4 players all phasing one smokes at monsters at the last tourney broke me
0:56:18	MattMeeko	@fl0m what would be better? just curious how they should have the smoke phase out. I might be big dumb
0:56:20	NervS	smoke*
0:56:30	LowRatedHighlander	You peepoSit in smoke until it fizzles out and you see them before they see you
0:56:31	justiey	@MrFortyOz its bc theyre cheating Kappa
0:56:35	el_chapo_jr13	HYPERNODDERS SHOW TIDDIES HYPERNODDERS
0:56:35	NibletTide	TTK of a1s is lower than a4, except for the 2 hit (1 HS)
0:56:38	wrokanik	the spray feels nicer with this dmg
0:56:39	hemo_tox	I think its more equal now (with tradeoffs), rather than being clearly inferior
0:56:41	errorCS_BM	@fl0m do u think coL will do good on lan they have 4 lan players disincluding poizon cuz hes hasnt played much on lan in the tier 1 lvl
0:56:41	ShreddedCheeks	hey fl0m, i turned 25 today fl0mBirthday
0:56:42	SupraUK_	i don't think the A4 rof is 25% faster so A1S should have the higher ttk
0:56:44	splitsky_	just dont miss 4Head
0:56:45	Shepdogg77	@NervS are you talking about that navi game where 2 from each team were in the smoke?
0:56:45	ridemahbike	what TTK?
0:56:45	rusher69	true...valorant smokes feels better to play around
0:56:51	NervS	yes
0:56:52	BoomingBusiness	4 bodyshots kill now on the A1 so
0:56:53	RyanGDS	@ridemahbike time to kill

0:57:43	Zorik13	to many times
0:57:43	peepofat852	b1t is probably top 5 rifler now
0:57:45	ShreddedCheeks	KEKwiggle @r_udra
0:57:49	absollutte	the fact that you can flash through a smoke and not get blinded on valorant is wack
0:57:53	macbookfps	@furdahcs do you prefer a clean a1-s or something flashy
0:57:53	siiiif	harpua91 Peepo

0:58:09	Gearslayer360	will they ever tweak the sg again? it feels kinda useless now @fl0m
0:58:13	furdahcs	@macbookfps anything works
0:58:13	hemo_tox	@fl0m counterpoint: its fucking NaVi wutchu gonna do
0:58:14	dolev801	the smoke should just faze toword it center from every direction
0:58:19	LowRatedHighlander	It is wack but with how flashes work in Valorant I think it works with it better
0:58:19	siiiif	the sky Peepo
0:58:19	PerhapsItsPeach	eh we all know OGs style, lose their map pick win the next 2 fl0m
0:58:21	priiide_	@absollutte prior to the flash change, it was one of the only ways to really get out onto a site
0:58:27	SupraUK_	SG isn't useless
0:58:27	Piesso	OG isnt taking map control unless they are given it @fl0m
0:58:31	SupraUK_	it's  great for holding angles
0:58:32	ra1n1ngdeath	@hemo_tox is he wrong tho
0:58:37	moritzh	sg is fine
0:58:38	SuperTuscan888	super hard MmmHmm
0:58:40	Shepdogg77	@SupraUK_ yes it is
0:58:41	BoomingBusiness	the SG is being used a little in pro play
0:58:41	ekipowerx	they could make the sma
0:58:43	Bacabomb125	same damage add scope
0:58:44	sisyphus1844	what about the awp
0:58:45	bigbruhbeans	if they made the fire rate on sg just a tiny bit faster
0:58:47	whitechocolate64	half of OG's rounds have come off Aleksi getting 3 entries with a galil KEKW
0:58:50	AFMhughes	put that same pressure short a send one monster one long then three can come down con and do something b
0:58:50	Gearslayer360	fix the godawful spray? @fl0m
0:58:53	billballbowl	@Gearslayer360 if I have M4 i still swap to it... 1 kill headshot
0:58:56	RyanGDS	dont make it better than the ak, just make it have situations where its useful
0:59:01	ekipowerx	they could make it cheaper than ak
0:59:01	fresh_zucchini	I like blade but he loves set pieces and simple is not built for those
0:59:02	SupraUK_	give the SG the same ROF as the A1-S
0:59:03	macbookfps	@furdahcs control panel is a cheap pink skin, but I like the nightmare for a budget flashy skin, printstream obviously if you wanna push the $50 budget
0:59:03	SupraUK_	ez fix
0:59:08	Steve_Rockie	Make it like AUG, AK unscoped, slow spray scoped
0:59:10	mukulhayaran	!1deag
0:59:10	Nightbot	mukulhayaran pops a 1deag on braix68 1TAP
0:59:11	Ravager72	Can we discuss the real game changing part of the update? Dual Elites are cheaper now fl0mHmm @fl0m
0:59:12	enikxe1	make a revolver that one shots to the body
0:59:14	Raithorn	i think the SG is just right. pin point for knockin noggins
0:59:14	Sem073	Sg spray is so ez
0:59:15	fresh_zucchini	electronic is built for anything
0:59:16	siiiif	give the SG a grenade launcher peepoSit
0:59:17	ekipowerx	give it cheaper than ak
0:59:17	NervS	increase damage take away automatic firing, oh wait thats an autosniper
0:59:18	errorCS_BM	i feel like the a1s needs to be reduced to 20 like the older days  or else we going to see mfs spraying through the smokes all the time
0:59:20	dolev801	no headshot kill but more body dmg @fl0m
0:59:20	hobrev	oh god no
0:59:22	Bacabomb125	make it 3k
0:59:28	ekipowerx	why not
0:59:28	justiey	id just increase the fire rate a tiny bit
0:59:29	Bacabomb125	better fire rate slightly
0:59:30	whitechocolate64	just make the SG free
0:59:31	peepofat852	I feel like Navi is literally a perfect team now
0:59:36	AFMhughes	sg for 2000
0:59:36	SuperTuscan888	I think just increasing the fire rate a tiny bit would help
0:59:41	SuperTuscan888	nothing more
0:59:43	furdahcs	@macbookfps thanks I know 2 of the 3 KEKW I'll check em out fl0mHeart
0:59:44	Shepdogg77	idk I think the SG is very usable
0:59:44	nuke_cs	make it 3750 and put it at AK fire rate
0:59:44	RyanGDS	peepoShy just increase the cost of the AK to 3100
0:59:44	NibletTide	just make the SG more precise, so it fills the niche of longe range rifle
0:59:44	blankdeck31	full auto rifle with scope cheaper than AK omegalul
0:59:45	Piesso	guns are fine tbh
0:59:45	friendlymackerel	if it 1 taps to the head and costs less itll be bought so much
0:59:45	Moobot	fl0m is now sponsored by IBuyPower! Check it out here http://ibuypower.com/r/fl0m and throw fl0m's code "fl0m" in for a 5% discount. fl0mCode
0:59:47	Tearbydeath_	What if you switch the price of ak and sg?
0:59:48	justiey	yeah true
0:59:49	casa_0	make it 2k have better fire rate, spray pattern, more ammo :)
0:59:50	Sem073	But a scope on an AK. Problem solved.
0:59:52	hceqi	make it as it was when overpowered, but decrease the dmg, so it requires 2 headshots for a kill
0:59:52	Destructoid5858	The awp should be $1700 in honor of the Negev. Lo
0:59:52	Archit47	sg sucks big time could be buffed a bit I think
0:59:52	AMutantCookie	make the famas burst good peepoRiot
0:59:52	freakswat	SG still a headshot machine tho, if you have good accuracy on it, it can do damage
0:59:53	fresh_zucchini	ak 2800 but I am ank idiot
0:59:54	sisyphus1844	if SG and AUG were the same gun (like w/o one shot headshot) they could increase the fire rate and still make it not too OP and also useful
0:59:54	hemo_tox	just make the SG 500, insta HS from all distances, and have the M4A4 ROF. Then we can all spam $500 in the chats
0:59:55	ShrapTy	This is good chat, let’s get all the bad ideas out of the way first
0:59:56	bigboy3003	@fl0m make the SG red because red's a cool colour
0:59:59	LowRatedHighlander	Just make the sg better Peepo
1:00:03	SupraUK_	SG is fine tbh
1:00:03	blussed	remove it
1:00:04	LowRatedHighlander	Just code it Peepo
1:00:04	SuperTuscan888	Not crossing the line of making it the best weapon, just tiny tweaks
1:00:05	siiiif	make default SG skin have anime girls on it, people would use it waaaaay more
1:00:07	chickenuggetz2	I say get rid of it and put in throwable chickens
1:00:08	Bacabomb125	give it a substantial price increase? like maybe put it at 3100 dollars
1:00:11	Gearslayer360	@fl0m i dont think it has to be better on stats. the benefit is the scope. i think it just needs a bit of love
1:00:12	khal1dxD	4Head
1:00:13	AssistMaster98n4	@ShrapTy KEKW
1:00:14	alemeffayoh	twitch chat always has the dumbest questions and answers...
1:00:14	MrFortyOz	its silenced like thats a good feature i think this patch the a1s is balanced
1:00:15	mortysfatlota	How was it on 1.6 tho, wasnt it balanced? @fl0m
1:00:16	peepofat852	i actually want smg to have more diversity
1:00:16	HainZz__	@fl0m What about valve and the R8 KEKW
1:00:18	c0smosLIVE	i think that the game is incredibly well balanced right now stop changing it
1:00:23	royield	im just glad shotguns arent broken
1:00:24	WekePeke	they're going to a stack again
1:00:26	Speedrulez	is there a chance the SG could be just an AK with a scope for a steep price increase. like around 4k fl0m
1:00:28	icywe1ner	@fl0m if your argument is that the ak is what the sg is being balanced around, then what if they nerfed the ak
1:00:30	hobrev	OG feels powerless
1:00:30	stonejinxer	another stack smh
1:00:31	blankdeck31	sawed off was a really useful weapon until they killed cobble
1:00:32	LowRatedHighlander	Make the sg shoot boogie bombs that make you Fortnite dance Peepo
1:00:33	Jay_rb	Will streamer have a child first or will he put something on the fucking walls behind him!? Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z
1:00:35	chickenuggetz2	So EZ
1:00:36	justiey	okay perfecto chill
1:00:36	BizarreMark	Sadge
1:00:38	SuperTuscan888	It's still $400 more, I feel like making it feel like a $400 more weapon than the ak would make more sense
1:00:38	WekePeke	damn
1:00:39	errorCS_BM	y is niko awping ?? isnt mantuu the awper did i miss any role changes
1:00:40	Piesso	this is a slaughter

1:01:00	Thugs_Bunny268	@fl0m is it wrong to think a refined NA style superior to EU because Eu tense to be too slow to their detrament

1:01:02	LowRatedHighlander	@siiiif peepoShy
1:01:04	ra1n1ngdeath	the slightest of tweaks will bring big ramifications in yhe pro scene

1:01:16	Gearslayer360	@fl0m i dont think it has to be better on stats. the benefit is the scope. i think it just needs a bit of love
1:01:16	siiiif	remove SG and replace with Vandal Peepo
1:01:19	bigbruhbeans	on the real they need to do something to the ump. Its just never an option its so awful
1:01:26	Piesso	@WekePeke oh shoot, they went too fast for me to notice then LUL
1:01:28	SquaredG	@fl0m they could make the sg and ak the same stats but you get the scope to zoom in and take longer range shots
1:01:31	mortysfatlota	Are we ready to see some nade dropping meta in the major chat LULW
1:01:32	SuperTuscan888	do you think we even need an SG on the t-side?

1:01:35	fresh_zucchini	that's fair, ak feels the most rewarding but ct should be able to complete better on full buys

2:00:07	LucidR9	like if we had even de gea on the pitch maybe he could've kept things structred, but it was a back line of people with no instruction, a poor choice from ole @Speedrulez

2:00:13	ImTarco	@bluehipp0 Mollies are usually just alcohol bottles with a rag/bandana/cloth stuffed under the cap. So... alcohol, usually.

2:02:37	bluehipp0	@ImTarco I guess we might be both right: "A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as petrol (gasoline), alcohol, or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper."

2:03:29	ImTarco	@bluehipp0 Yeah I got that too. A molotov seems like a catch-all term for an incendiary throwable in the form of a glass bottle.

2:23:09	SoporificPanda	i like short game because i am old
2:23:09	messyhair	BLANKIES

2:23:21	eclipse42	but does it give you the same amount of elo as a long game? do we know that yet
2:23:22	praeter15	not sweating in short games D:
2:23:22	13telloh	"Its 100% ok to have an opinion, it just happens that yours is wrong" fav thing to say LOL
2:23:25	aunathons	LETSGO
2:23:26	carboxylate1	peepoChrist perfecto
2:23:30	Deagent9	could give it wingman economy
2:23:33	pear_sounds	@nigentaum i'm not too picky about my plugs, as long as they feel good going in i'm happy
2:23:35	McBubba03	@sleeeeppyyyy seems like a good plan, it's the opposite with me though, my parents have always wanted the newest one lol
2:23:37	herbn	the previous economy changes lend themselves well to the shortened game
2:23:37	SoporificPanda	economy is fine in short game IMHO. unless you just want to buy every round which is dumb
2:23:38	arkzenx	🚬
2:23:39	njblumberg	can u rank up and down with the short games?
2:23:40	bruhandon46	Short games feel amazing, you get the rush of playing comp without the dread of playing 30 rounds

2:23:51	Zorik13	2 buy rounds on ct per half isnt normal @fl0m
2:23:51	AMutantCookie	if they do short games should be pistol then gun rounds imo
2:23:53	javo_	short games kinda hard if you mess the economy one round, you fucked almost half of your side
2:23:54	jaxxfps	5v5 on wingman format
2:23:55	LongRodVonHugeDonger	@fl0m if you force every round whats the issue
2:23:56	AFMhughes	warowl said get rid of pistol round
2:23:57	LowRatedHighlander	I don’t see Econ needing to be changed
2:24:00	praeter15	AMutantCookie weird
2:24:00	kiwibass90	May be too much emphasis on pistol rounds now
2:24:01	guckmalnachhinten_	it changed basicly with the m4a1 being good now
2:24:02	Raithorn	it sucks as CTs to lose the first gun round cause the game can just be over right there
2:24:03	WookiePotamus	I cant believe that activision blizzard nerfed jett her movement speed is the only reason i played CS guess ill have to go play Battlefield at least Bungie knows how to make a good game
2:24:04	kono_dio_da_4	@fl0m doesn't the dropping nades stuff make the life of site anchors even worse and makes things very t sided no?
2:24:07	subt1tlez	CT economy needs a little bump too many saves instead of trying to win clutches

2:26:19	AsteL999	remember how long pros ignored the krieg KEKW
2:26:20	ayykennay	it took a long time for people to figure out that UMP was good back then
2:26:25	aunathons	I hope that the dropping grenades isn’t a thing or can be disabled. Imagine defaulting banana you use your nades to take it, get hit to Low HP and then you can just have a nade set dropped to you NotLikeThis
2:26:25	kritsz_r	who???

2:26:43	Raithorn	knows the game enough to trash the update but not good enough to make it 1 month with a team
2:26:43	cs_java	I think T side molly and smoke should be increased by 100 dollars to help balance a little, that's my opinion
2:26:47	Mr_Gatler	don't get me wrong msl is a genius but shouldn't he be off the internet for a week or 2 after what happened with south KEKW
2:26:48	subt1tlez	What about MOTM's Idea about only allowing to drop nades in spawn?
2:26:50	bolottekid	YEP like just appreciate the update and check em out, figure out as much new things as possible
2:26:57	dolev801	@fl0m  someone tried the fake flash on me he got bodied
2:27:06	ayykennay	@13telloh krieg used to be $3000 so it wasn't that popular
2:27:07	praeter15	buffed the price peepoSit
2:27:09	Justhoohaa	wasnt it 3600?
2:27:16	CortanaLXIX	at some point someone will find a strat with dropping nades thats broken then people will figure it out and then someone will come up with a new strat just as the meta always changes
2:27:16	therealkopojken	seems like a lot of pros tend to be resistant to change in CS
2:27:18	Deagent9	i wish we had the old krieg and just make it expensive
2:27:20	flyguy1449	what was the aug?
2:27:20	fedoralva	But Fl0m, now people will be able to throw 2 SMOKES in 1 ROUND. Game broke
2:27:21	Deagent9	it is so awful now
2:27:23	kono_dio_da_4	@fl0m how  an you compare the R8 update and this update KEKW?
2:27:25	V1ZzxX	I mean that can be just used to buy a shitload of util *

3:42:32	siiiif	I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. pepeBean

If there is only one baiter then that means BlameF has baited all of the baiters. If there are no baiters, then that means BlameF is no longer on earth. If the world is against BlameF, then BlameF baits the world.

5:51:02	RyanGDS	boiling frogs
5:51:04	ShrapTy	like legit exactly what you're saying happened to us KEKPOINT
5:51:07	bigb1058	renting companies are also over paying for house fucking people who want to buy a house instead of rent
5:51:14	Luigistarx	is that even legal in vegas?
5:51:15	hog_farmee	@ShrapTy happened to me as well at my last place. shouldnt be allowed to do that shit. cant put a burden like that on people
5:51:15	LL19990	wth flom, missed pistol round because of ada
5:51:17	SoporificPanda	selling it at that point is more or less typical
5:51:26	Destructoid5858	The rent here went up $500 after switching management. It switched the day we moved in
5:51:27	VOpavs	@LL19990 get prime lol
5:51:36	ShrapTy	hog_farmee right, its insanity. The only reason we really decided to buy a house
5:51:40	Mentalstatemike	its legal because there's no such thing as rent control
5:51:45	Kafkii	You probably got prerolled KEKW
5:51:45	bgs51	how did Coldzera look lmap 1?

5:51:53	Fanefanu22	thats not even legal in EU
5:51:54	Snewby	it's legal, but that doesn't make it good or right
5:51:57	dbz1h	missed the first map was buying luxury apartment buildings in vegas, how did coldzera look?
5:51:57	Gearslayer360	@fl0m all the places near me do shitty renovations, call the place luxury, then charge hundreds more than the last year lol
5:51:58	nanerpus_	i got a second set of ads as well
5:52:03	nerkkin	You sign a lease for a monthly price, that can’t be legal to do lol
5:52:06	mackinS4	Buying a house is getting harder and harder with people buying up properties to rent them out.
5:52:07	LL19990	sadge

5:52:30	CortanaLXIX	just sub to fl0m so you dont get ads
5:52:31	Nick3306	@nerkkin it actually is but they have to let you walk with no penalties if they do it.
5:52:35	NoRcaL23	@nerkkin depends on what is in the lease. there could be a clause that allows it

6:15:50	fateoftomorrow	J&J f’d me up for a night
6:15:50	ToastedWaffles_	the day I got my second shot was the day I got back to work from having covid for real, shit was like someone rung the bell for round 2.
6:15:52	djlunchbox13	J&J wasn't bad at all lol
6:15:52	The_Shuck	@actrevian there is no Covid in the vaccine
6:15:53	Killer_Panda2k11	J&J is ineffective compared to pfizer/moderna
6:15:55	khalidsmalls	@mackinS4 that means u got the virus already

6:16:07	siiiif	LucidR9 my balls WICKED
6:16:12	bluehipp0	I think from what I heard from my brother in Germany: if you wait a few weeks longer between shots, the side effects from the 2nd shot are less severe
6:16:14	DerXello	no side effects from both shots
6:16:14	LucidR9	nice one siiiif
6:16:15	mackinS4	@mackinS4 If I did, I had zero symptoms from the virus lol.
6:16:17	Actrevian	i just couldnt move my arm for like 16 hours after getting my #2
6:16:18	ThrowIfNotJett	Cult vibes
6:16:19	Luigistarx	I got pfizer and only had a score arm from both shots
6:16:20	Uwotm08	@Killer_Panda2k11 It's not that bad. It's less effective but not by a lot.
6:16:21	dweevers	fl0m you're basically having the same reaction I had. Hopefully it only lasts the day like mine did
6:16:21	DerXello	prob depends on the person
6:16:24	nickthesizz	@Stogie6 ya i bat for both teams pfizer and mod
6:16:25	siiiif	nice one my balls HELLAWICKED
6:16:25	el_chapo_jr13	@fl0m so your balls aren't growing?
6:16:27	dolev801	@fl0m  the third dose hit even harder
6:16:28	bluehipp0	I waited only 2 weeks and my 2nd shot side effects were pretty much on the stronger end
6:16:29	CortanaLXIX	first dose i had a sore arm like someone stabbed me with a needle and second shot i have a sore arm like someone stabbed it with a needle
6:16:30	n00mann	Sure you can take that j&j better than nori
6:16:32	Mentalstatemike	i had the rare covid shot side effect both times with me getting enlarged lymph nodes in my armpits
6:16:33	Stogie6	I had 0 side effects from my second but my wife felt like she got hit by a truck

6:16:52	Stogie6	@nickthesizz Ayy, same!  Full spectrum 5G coverage
6:16:53	LucidR9	if you didnt have any side effects it means the government was already in your brain, the side effects are from the mind reading amplifiers the vaccine constructs in your head, so if you dont get them you already had the mind reading in you
6:16:53	LuxionGames	very fun
