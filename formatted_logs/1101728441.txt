0:27:54	errorcsau	I am such fl0m fan. As soon as he starts streaming I open it up, watch the advertisement, go back and watch the advertisement again. I do this non stop from the minute he starts streaming to when he stops, sometimes for 8 hours straight. I maximize his ad revenue. I have done this for about 2 years every single time he streams. I have seen all of the ads many times. I am such big fl0mfan.

2:29:42	praeter15	There are no such things as "Legos". They don't exist. "Lego" refers to the COMPANY THAT MAKES THE TOY, and thus the shortening Lego is acceptable. Saying "I'm playing with my Lego" works because it's referring to the sets themselves: The individuals aspects that make of the toy from the bricks to the mini-figures to the electronics to the other little parts. It isn't claiming that the fucking square bricks are each a Lego.

4:36:43	Odrann	i dont enjoy unranked game modes anymore since they are often more sweaty in my experience
4:36:48	Gittawat_	sbmm is a good thing . you don't want to be sliver in diamond match for sure.
4:37:00	TinyRL_	@Odrann yes because they end up being where the rnaked sweats who rage and get queue time outs go

4:37:18	dankiyy	no ranked but extreme sbmm is no bueno

4:37:23	vis9ns	W A R Z OMEGALUL N E
4:37:23	Pappy_Pud	the original sbmm was getting yeeted by a blue shell
4:37:25	TinyRL_	@dankiyy yep its the worst of both

4:38:17	Uwotm08	I really don't see the point of unranked MM in CS:GO.
4:38:17	Thugs_Bunny268	sssy bks
4:38:23	hunter6925	yeah exactly, its not like every warzone game is just a ffa for all skill groups
4:38:32	VashTS1	@flexluthertv I do this, but I like to pretend im a rattle snake
4:38:55	dotalegendery2	@Uwotm08 its useful when u wonna duo with a homie that has a different rank
4:38:55	TinyRL_	@Uwotm08 so the appeal would be that you could have a place to go with rules in place that match comp, but you dont have the pressure of ranked
4:38:56	D1srvpts	@Uwotm08 mostly if friends who are different skill levels want to play together without the higher skilled one worrying about rank

4:39:13	dotalegendery2	no smurfing needed @Uwotm08
4:39:17	notklutz	hi
4:39:17	Uwotm08	@D1srvpts There's the problem: you're worrying about ranks
4:39:23	Stogie6	@berd_tv CS (For me at least) Is a much better spectator game than Val. Val is the easier game to get into for new players. They each have their own strengths
4:39:24	TinyRL_	if i get shit on by someone who is clearly gaming ranks that feels bad
4:39:25	pickle13279	@fl0m have you played DOTA too?
4:39:33	yourducky	ask wookie about our fun times in unranked
4:39:35	Uwotm08	@fl0m How often have you played unranked MM since it was introduced?
4:39:36	yobtih	i can play with my friends now
4:39:38	LowRatedHighlander	@uwotm08 you gotta think about the new players. No new player is going to have a good experience if they are thrusted into comp cs go without an unranked playlist

4:39:52	TinyRL_	CSGO feels awful as a new player
4:39:54	dims_cs	FACTS FL0M
4:39:56	connorbh111	did they replace casual for unranked 5v5?
4:39:57	yobtih	4kev keeps trying that shit
4:39:58	TinyRL_	you play nothing like comp
4:39:58	MyHughJazz	Casual sucks asses. Yes multiple
4:40:01	jackhale	unranked is a great feature but I still want to play a high quality game of CSGO I just don't want a rank attatched
4:40:01	whitechocolate64	you cant get new players interested in the game by throwing them immediately into a sweaty environment
4:40:03	Pappy_Pud	i don't think there's any down side to unranked mm
4:40:03	yobtih	and 4kev keeps getting fucked
4:40:05	flexluthertv	thats the only way I can play with my one friend who almost never plays
4:40:05	dims_cs	oh shit i'm a sub nice
4:40:07	JooNas_OW	the fact that i dont have to samurf when playing with gold nova firends is great
4:40:08	TinyRL_	and then you go straight into ranked which feels awful
4:40:09	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander Unranked MM still throws them into a competitive environment where they're expected to perform.
4:40:10	xremmyxcsgo	Before you had to just go on mirc and find a group and someone needed to have a server
4:40:12	dims_cs	fl0mSwole
4:40:13	LowRatedHighlander	No playlist before unranked teaches you the economy or 5v5 on the maps in the comp map pool
4:40:16	bolottekid	In unranked mm I don’t have to mald with ppl not comming
4:40:18	jackhale	right now unranked has a lot of leavers and very little team coordination
4:40:24	Odrann	Stogie6 so true i only play val atm because i dont solo mm in cs but i only watch cs streams LUL
4:40:25	jamejacobs	yeah I should play unranked more
4:40:30	MyHughJazz	You called?
4:40:34	dotalegendery2	the was so mm
4:40:40	dankiyy	on cs we opened the server browser to pug
4:40:42	dotalegendery2	u could q servers
4:40:49	flexluthertv	@jackhale I see no difference between that and ranked KEKW

4:40:50	TinyRL_	@jackhale That is something valve has to adress. I will give riot credit, they have taken measures to punish that kind of behavior in val
4:40:51	D1srvpts	@Uwotm08 if the issue is you just don't think a rank is meaningful then there's no reason to explain unranked
4:40:53	Sunnycss	It took them almost a decade to add a actual unranked
4:40:54	Stogie6	@Odrann I was the same for a while. But I've since uninstalled Val, just not fun to solo queue anymore for me
4:40:59	Uwotm08	Ranked has a lot of leavers too, unfortunately, especially if you queue for the new maps like Grind.
4:41:00	fratolad	I mean ranked also has leavers and no team coordination LMAO
4:41:02	xremmyxcsgo	I’m considering just going to faceit
4:41:03	LowRatedHighlander	@uwotm08 that’s fine but there’s no risk in playing it. It lets them learn the main mechanics of the game without getting flamed by their teammates because they didn’t know they had to buy armor every round
4:41:07	Gittawat_	Yeah
4:41:18	Sunnycss	You get cooldowns for leaving unranked
4:41:21	Uwotm08	@LowRatedHighlander I'll need a citation for no flaming by teammates in unranked
4:41:22	BL4CKHOUSE	Had someone leave in 4 separate ranked games i played yesterday
4:41:22	TinyRL_	@LowRatedHighlander dude if i hadnt had a person queue with me every game of my first 30 telling me what to do
4:41:24	dreamshadow0	hey fl0m
4:41:26	Odrann	Stogie6 yea all my friends play val i dont solo q either LUL but i dont play that much anymore
4:41:34	TinyRL_	id have quit csgo before I ever got to really experience it
4:41:39	jamejacobs	it's a good place to learn maps
4:41:46	westnilekyle50	the barrier to entry was too high for new csgo players, so unranked will naturally remove that barrier
4:41:47	dreamshadow0	KEKPOINT
4:41:51	yobtih	4kev kept going
4:41:54	TinyRL_	its so different from so many other shooters

4:41:56	seymourmoney	Does anyone know what stickers Elige uses for his AK?
4:42:01	yobtih	and he finally got the kill
4:42:06	Odrann	Stogie6 i can only do 1 or 2 games before im tilted off my ass from the smurfs KEKW
4:42:06	LowRatedHighlander	@tinyrl_ exactly. The new player experience is trash if you don’t have a Sherpa because there was quite literally no way of learning it without playing comp

4:45:55	LowRatedHighlander	Main problem is the player base is small so you fix that by trying to make for a better experience for new players which for csgo before unranked was appalling
4:46:02	TinyRL_	I still love csgo... I just hate what the experience has become

6:26:58	scoutpack151	@fl0m What was the KZ map you played earlier? I forgot to ask
6:27:00	theHovnival	I've just stopped giving a fun and queue with fun people instead of good people.

6:27:37	theHovnival	@vashts1 yeah, there is one group I love to play with that are good
6:27:38	b_vu	@thehovnival that’s good, I’m just so fucking competitive still. I love to win and hate to lose hahaha

6:27:52	Nightbot	Counter Strike Is dying because I can’t get a decent fucking game for the life of me. Ranks are broken everywhere and I’m getting at least one griefer on my team every other game. Matchmaking so unbalanced and I’m including dogshit FACEIT. Really is quite sad how I can’t get decent games

6:30:28	NaujQF	I hate MM, I started to play this game again and I feel like sometimes I get games with people above my level and those are really enjoyable but most of the games are just people running around. Yesterday I won a 16-14 game where 3 out of my teammates didn't get to 10 kills
6:30:28	b_vu	@radiantdawn9 sometimes I like to play alone but I guess that’s just not best for trying to win cs games consistently
6:30:29	fumingbob	@Piraiba Sadge
6:30:32	Zeyzo_	Having fun is fun so not caring and just vibing is fun NODDERS
6:30:35	Piraiba	I rage in CS and I hate it Sadge
6:30:45	Piraiba	FeelsBadMan
6:30:58	VashTS1	@radiantdawn9 I agree with this, but not 100% of the time. Sometimes you win and the people you eneded up playing with are super toxic shits
6:31:00	evil_m0rti	decided to punish myself with some mm
6:31:02	fumingbob	i think even faceit would be better for casual play, ofc theres toxic guys but thats life
6:31:04	evil_m0rti	on d2
6:31:14	scoutpack151	@Zeyzo_ For me, trying is fun. But I have had a rough time lately with griefers and smurfs. or just bad teammates.
