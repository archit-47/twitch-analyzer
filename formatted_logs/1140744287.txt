2:39:31	erk12	Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because fl0m was already dead.

2:46:49	TyphloMusic	nt
2:46:52	dweevers	zHustlin it solves the "perceived" latency of who clicks first. the server would be able to resole it properly
2:46:53	satelitko88	@satelitko88 It's not about regular time. CPU's execute millions of instructions per second, so that level of precision would let servers sync player actions orders of magnitude more precisely.

7:26:06	TenGee36	Its the Balloon Tower Defense Pro League?

7:27:10	dootsyy	oo got him
7:27:12	STatisfacti0n	okay. I just wonder if it was a "doccy" thing when that was said is all. I honestly have no idea because last I knew, I believe doccy identified as a male
7:27:16	Not_Grahm	@adzno KEKW
7:27:29	STatisfacti0n	but if that is different now I just don't want to use the wrong pronouns lol
7:27:40	barnumbirr	@adzno at work, mine usually are "leave me alone" so no sweat :D
7:28:01	STatisfacti0n	also @adzno that's hilarious
7:28:05	macbookfps	@STatisfacti0n makes sense
7:28:11	Scibber	I think Doccy just needs to be addressed as cult leader
7:28:12	Not_Grahm	Watch out for mind goblins @fl0m
7:28:18	adzno	@STatisfacti0n No ones ever asked me before lmao
7:28:23	STatisfacti0n	@fl0m do you have any idea about Doccy's preferred pronouns?
7:28:33	STatisfacti0n	honestly, nobody has ever asked me in person either
7:28:35	STatisfacti0n	then again I have a beard

10:20:33	STatisfacti0n	if it's something stuck in your hand just use a needle ez
10:20:39	ploucroux	do you use a chainsaw to remove loose teeth too
10:20:46	AFugy	wash your hands in cold water first
10:21:03	therealkopojken	tip of a knife works fine as well to get shit out
10:21:05	Lyrnefps	sandpaper works the skin off and reveals the splinter. just use a small piece on the area where you feel it's stuck. it just takes the first layer of skin off and doesnt hurt
10:21:09	Sinobi___	p90 KEKW
10:21:12	STatisfacti0n	@therealkopojken chill out there, Frank
10:21:15	macbookfps	just ask nori for her finest tweezers and pluck that splinter out KEKW
10:21:30	swag_parrot	Heyyy thanks for the gifted man I found you a lil ways back on a drinking stream

10:22:09	STatisfacti0n	@therealkopojken https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3pk9CMwtN0
10:22:18	therealkopojken	tends to hurt less if you do it yourself though
10:22:49	Rilzerg	I'm a fan of ripping the skin above the splinter by picking with a sharp needle and teasing it out with the tip
10:23:27	therealkopojken	the knife thing is just same technique as a needle really
10:23:36	kronicgod17	nah just leave it for a day if you can and then go in with a needle and if that doesn't work use a knife. how i always do it whenever i get splinters, metal or wood.
