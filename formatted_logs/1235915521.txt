1:14:18	k1bsTV	Yeah, I agree with that.
1:14:23	k1bsTV	I think the Krieg is underused.
1:14:23	SinoXcs	niko 27 kills
1:14:24	ninetyfivemonkeys	round 21 and hes at 28 kills
1:14:24	SkatterJax	Makes sense on maps like this with large open outer areas/long lanes

1:14:36	ShaawAU	for a player like niko
1:14:38	guckmalnachhinten_	niko is going for that #2 HLTV
1:14:39	k1bsTV	It's def more situational than it used to be, but I think it's underutilized.

1:18:44	apoodle10	hard question, a lot of people have rough times in their lives and being a good friend can also mean sticking it out with them for a while, but if that person refuses to change and/or takes something out on their friends, you should also be on the lookout for your own wellbeing need_todiet
