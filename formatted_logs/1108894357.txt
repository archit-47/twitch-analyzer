5:04:50	phatcarboholic	Sadge
5:04:56	DanOBrien416	Hell yeah. Invest in yourself.
5:04:57	JOHN__WlCK	really it is bad to stretch isometrically before lifting
5:04:59	GFYMeowMix	win out or lose out Prayge
5:05:03	bruhandon46	keeping up on those vitamins?
5:05:05	JOHN__WlCK	statically*

5:05:31	GFYMeowMix	deadlifting or squatting furdahcs ?
5:05:42	SuperTuscan888	pls win out from here Prayge
5:05:45	furdahcs	I tried cracking my back the other day and legit heard like 80 different pops
5:05:46	LowRatedHighlander	@furdahcs okie good widepeepoHappy
5:05:47	muglobal1988	16-14 Kreygasm
5:05:49	SuperTuscan888	we need the win streak Prayge
5:05:55	GFYMeowMix	@furdahcs those are the best POGGIES
5:05:55	phatcarboholic	@furdahcs old man Sadge
5:05:56	stucko	It CAN be bad to static stretch before lifting, but stretching before lifting is good
5:06:02	Achapman18	just tear a muscle it heals stronger :)
5:06:08	LtNotzoClutch	Stretching and meditation. WICKED good for you
5:06:08	furdahcs	@gfymeowmix deadlifting max+10
5:06:10	SuperTuscan888	Clap there we go
5:06:11	caffeinetx	i always stretch post warm-up/cardio before i hit weights. my workouts go so much better when i do that with cardio cooldown
5:06:11	21slappage	It’s bad to be hydrated while you lift
5:06:13	Grim_Limdulx	lmao its always a good idea to stretch before lifting coming from an exercise science major -_-
5:06:15	somanybiscuits	statistically, more cars crash that have oil in them than now
5:06:19	jehl3	I think he was saying you should warm up and then stretch. Don't just straight up stretch
5:06:21	GFYMeowMix	@furdahcs HYPERNODDERS that'll do it
5:06:22	somanybiscuits	not*
5:06:24	FletcherB10	don't breathe when you lift
5:06:37	furdahcs	@rohan8357 asking the wrong people
5:06:38	TinyRL_	yea id tend to agree even a light warmup pre-stretch is good

5:06:46	JOHN__WlCK	@fl0m if you look into it, it is not  a great idea to stretch statically, its better to stretch dynamically if that makes sense, then static after
5:06:47	stucko	Duct tape your mouth and clothespin your nostrils, youll lift better Kappa
5:07:12	SuperTuscan888	take DMT before you lift, it'll do wonders
5:07:16	macbookfps	chat if you turn red as a tomato while lifting and not breathing, it'll help you add +50 lbs
5:07:18	BrotherBeelo13	Whenever you deadlift, make sure to take your legs completely out of it. Put it all into you back and groin @fl0m.

5:07:38	guyritchie27	i've heard popping a tiddy beforehand helps your lifts too Peeposit
5:07:40	furdahcs	do 3/4 of the hokiepokie, kick your own left nipple, clap 3 times, then lift that's the way to go
5:07:41	GFYMeowMix	not fl0m's first rodeo, and he has a trainer
5:07:44	teethirtyf0ur	Make sure to lift alone, spotters make you lazy
5:07:50	ShrapTy	@BrotherBeelo13 underrated advice
5:07:51	TinyRL_	@furdahcs idk if i can take your advice
5:07:52	furdahcs	lick not kick*
5:07:56	JOHN__WlCK	just dont want to see you in snap city
5:07:58	stucko	I bench press with my legs and back, and deadlift with my triceps and chest YEP
5:08:02	macbookfps	yeah furdah idk bout you but i can't kick my nipple
