4:15:35	Uwotm08	CS:GO as an esport has everything: it's low barrier to entry for spectators and it's got a pretty high skill ceiling. Things don't happen super quickly and the spectator support in the game is phenomenal. Plus, the casters are excellent, and there's a vibrant scene for story-writing around individuals.
