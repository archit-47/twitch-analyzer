3:22:17	boxxythegoat	good morning everyone!
3:22:17	jamejacobs	@macbookfps MLADY
3:22:27	dweevers	GFYMeowMix yeah that one hurts but it's english so I get why it was so expensive
3:22:28	mk_48	what did they change about dust 2
3:22:33	zefixlikescsgo	mid cross smoke? KEKWait
3:22:39	sleeeeppyyyy	jockst3r spurs just looked lost and confused. kane just wants to be out. Sucks for Nuno that he has to deal with a team like spurs that gives up instantly
3:22:39	macbookfps	@mk_48 can't see ct cross from t spawn
3:22:41	mrfunkers	can't awp from T spawn
3:22:52	ImTarco	@mk_48 Blocked off vision from T spawn to doors. Suicide still exists, it just has a roof now.
3:23:09	mk_48	@macbookfps that is actually quite a big change
3:23:20	seamus_souleater	wait so is tarik going to 100T then?
3:23:21	jockst3r	@fl0m don
3:23:35	jockst3r	don't the ct's kinda have an advantage on that suicide peek though?
3:23:38	Im_Eclipsee	you like the new d2 ? @fl0m
3:23:40	ijnebz	its still viable to fight mid on t side, but if there is a decent awper on the other team then you're not beating the ct's
3:23:48	McBubba03	OOOO
3:23:49	jockst3r	@sleeeeppyyyy the manager fucked up that game
3:24:16	jockst3r	i'm glad that he did and that arsenal actually punished them for it
3:24:37	GFYMeowMix	well they beat city, wont their first few and everybody was like "ooohhh spurs could be legit" then they flopped last few and got RAILED in NLD
3:24:44	zefixlikescsgo	@jockst3r yes ct do have the advantage
3:24:45	ImTarco	I think the mid AWPer fighting mid off spawn will be a bit more viable at least.
3:24:56	sevinn	it's better than it used to be because chances are you aren't walking by 2 or 3 people peeking
3:24:56	dweevers	GFYMeowMix and now we're ahead of them in the table KEKW

3:25:25	GFYMeowMix	@dweevers KEKPOINT right, spurs first arsenal last...how quickly the tide changes
3:25:27	sleeeeppyyyy	GFYMeowMix spurs will never be "legit" or in the top 4. the team lacks A LOT. sucks to see son trapped in that team. he deserves to play in a better place
