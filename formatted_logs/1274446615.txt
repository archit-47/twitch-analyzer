2:01:36	FlameyKumori	@giagaminguk butter is fat which makes things taste better for just humanity, salt itself is a flavor enhancor when used right. Little bit of salt can enhance flavors rather than just making it taste salty. That's why when something tastes like it's missing something you add some salt and it tastes better. The salt enhanced everything. That's like basic cooking

7:08:30	apoodle_	i'm just learning about this, the fact that esl and faceit were bought by some saudi investors and are merging now is wild
7:08:32	insightzCS	imagine your going to go on faceit look at someone profile and it say esea adv or premier
7:08:35	insightzCS	thats trippy
7:08:37	notjoehoefr	@seeko89 idk joined 5mins ago haha
7:09:02	olandersmekochsmek	@arjunracing thank you fot he gift
7:09:04	sloveCS	it makes sense considering faceit caters to multiple games
7:09:07	apoodle_	i'd imagine that faceit keeps running the gameservice, and esl will take over the tournament side of things, but who knows

7:09:15	splitzkie_	that ESL Faceit handshake tweet could be what that means
7:09:17	seeko89	i wish esea was just free from a while ago for pugging... their AC i think is slightly better than faceit ?? but the player base is soo doodoo because of having to pay
7:09:18	Floofys	I didn't realize it's a Saudi org that bought FaceIt and ESEA. Fuck.
