4:13:12	fakeit08	@supra_nightmare i was just replying to that supid statement stating ronaldo lost juve the money and it was a "bad investment" it is never a bad investment it's a bit risky cause you hamper the growth of your young player but you can win the ucl in the short term just didn't happen for juve
4:13:31	StochasticDiscount	Every fucking year @Pappy_Pud
4:13:31	LucidR9	but I have yet to see a single source that says he made them money

4:17:12	supra_nightmare	@fakeit08 he is the perfect player for Juve, a slow harrassing style of offense. United is not that at all. United wants to cross is from CB to CF and score that way. they have no midfield to hold the ball
