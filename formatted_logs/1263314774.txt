7:18:23	frogoree	Junglah no, it makes the smoke pop in the wrong spot because it doesnt bounce
7:18:24	Deanooo	razer viper mini best mouse  $30
7:18:25	priiide_	@Junglah it makes it pop sooner and can mess up the positioning
7:18:31	rickstercs	@Junglah the molly makes the smoke bloom right when it hits the ground which causes it to be a little too far to the left which gives a gap in the right side of the smoke
