3:42:47	3lfie	esetag out I think
3:42:48	ThePandaLord_	basically - if it works, it'll work good
3:42:49	AkiroRaiden	@entea brollan has been on fnatic for 3 and a half years.. not 2
3:42:49	sator_cs	@LowRatedHighlander thank you
3:42:51	Sw3t_AtomiX	This major is going to be insane if everyone keeps on improving until then POGGERS

3:43:01	umaroreis	-plopski
3:43:01	honestamerican	ur right fl0m they overachived hard
3:43:01	iNk_CS	Do you think it’s minus Plop or minus Rez?
3:43:05	Hektic2	it was nothing but a failure
3:43:06	byron1740	is Brollen younger than Frozen?
3:43:07	two_drop	you guys saw it here first -- @fl0m says device is a failure
3:43:08	tvpwnzu	@quailman1234 Wtf???
3:43:12	umaroreis	-plopski -esetag +krimz +brollan
3:43:16	Hektic2	NIP was already in a shit show. They needed help KEKW
3:43:16	nyssen	NiP went from a top 15 team to a top 5 team last year due to signing device
3:43:17	BeauxGnar	phzy > dev1ce
3:43:17	ScreenFresh	-plopski as plopski is entry,

3:43:21	Dekuvl	dev1ce is an asset
3:43:26	DavieWhy	Mythic -fl0m +Jojo
3:43:27	medokolic	Nip has lack of motivation and firepower signing brollan is the perfect move because plopski is fhe entry fragger and he wins 2/10 dules
3:43:28	notoriousfats	Not Plopski?
3:43:29	oblivion0608	brollan + devve + hampus and rez perfroms fuck damn thats going to be a good time
3:43:30	MilanoCookies	-PLOPSKI NO?
3:43:30	AstonVilla4Ever	plopski is leaving , estag aint leaving
3:43:35	Mentalstatemike	people saying -plop are lost
3:43:36	Hektic2	They were already in shit. Anything at this point would help NIP
3:43:38	Quailman1234	@tvpwnzu consistent riflers
3:43:41	tvpwnzu	@quailman1234 makes absolutely 0 sense to add either of them when they’re already pursuing Brollan
3:43:46	jeffrocker1999	Esetag back to astralis?
3:43:51	SEANEHKELLEH	esetag + money to Fanatic for Brolin?
3:43:52	willisnutty	americantag
3:43:52	Moore2311	whats device dealing with
3:43:55	ScreenFresh	es3tag looks lost on executes i think they still have communication problems
3:43:55	Iszackk	Didn't Devve go back to DK?
3:43:55	ztanica	what do you think of the new astralis awper?
3:43:58	jeffqed	the thing nip needs the most is a proper igl lol
3:44:03	Alkahzane	and imagine if device can sort the underlying issues and are refreshed and motivated. the new Nip with brollan will be deadly

3:44:12	BeauxGnar	inb4 dev1ce a 1 to 1 trade brollan for device
3:44:14	outstandingidiot	Es3tag does not speak Swedish at all
3:44:14	AkiroRaiden	esetag is not it, he looked great in astralis as the 6th player but he's proved it was only luck while playing in cloud 9 and nip
3:44:21	霊剣27	lekro is on firee
3:44:22	GWdoPLANO	do you like hampus as igl?
3:44:23	slb_	@jeffqed WutFace

3:44:42	friendlylionwithglasses	lol, hampus by far their best player
3:44:43	Hektic2	@fl0m Honestly I feel like Esetag is just the last guy the team captains chose for dodge ball KEKW He's just a filler for teams KEKW . Was a filler for Astralis and for now NIP

3:45:41	Hektic2	Honestly I feel like Esetag is just the last guy the team captains chose for dodge ball KEKW He's just a filler for teams KEKW . Was a filler for Astralis and for now NIP
3:45:42	bluehipp0	Hampus actually misspelled Krampus though, so there's that... WeirdEyes
3:45:43	undercoverbulbasaur	@jeffqed such a bad take lmfao

3:45:47	DavieWhy	it was a me plz
3:45:48	Titansrage69	why keep Rez? he should be a star rifler and just is not

3:46:08	SEANEHKELLEH	why does Hallxerk have a weird clan tag?
3:46:09	throwieboy996	Agreed

3:46:19	Timdengrove	jeffqed and how do you know that?
3:46:19	freeziezgtm	@fockenj bro are you good?
3:46:22	DontBeSneakyTV	R EZ
3:46:22	PepperR6	Here's a take: get rid of Rez. The only utility he provides was that of a potential star player... but we know he doesn't really hit those performances on a consistent basis. I think he should get the boot
3:46:23	Humble1g	idk it's fishy
3:46:23	EGBcs	Rez 4 year contract
3:46:24	ninetyninehax	-es3tag + f0rest!!!
3:46:25	AkiroRaiden	@FourFN astralis has proved they're not great at picking players recently *cough* lucky *cough*... they picked him up cause they needed a 6th/7th to give the main 5 a break.. An he played great, just like bubzki, but ever since he left astralis he has been suuper bad.
3:46:26	AstonVilla4Ever	@SEANEHKELLEH its bodø glimt, norways best football team
3:46:26	jeffrocker1999	@sw3t_atomix I mean he did reportedly got a perform or get benched
3:46:28	mybox	y
3:46:33	tomz_	REZ needs the correct set up and he pops off
3:46:34	ananas197	didn't dig play three today? @fl0m or am i tripping
3:46:34	SEANEHKELLEH	I see
3:46:41	honestamerican	rez needs to have some space, thats when he can shine
3:46:42	DirtyDan161	what roles does Brollan play?
3:46:45	3lfie	plopski or krimz? @fl0m
3:46:47	Humble1g	ohh cuz of health
3:46:48	DavieWhy	everyone in Cs is just larping
3:46:48	mrmazztronaut	Rez is just too mercurial to be the guy
3:46:53	Mentalstatemike	KEKW
3:46:56	ScreenFresh	@DirtyDan161 entry
3:46:56	mrmazztronaut	he always shows glimpses
3:46:57	gamer9627	wtf he resigned ???
3:46:57	air_0k	Someone’s gotta play the second entry a la Karrigan-Rain
3:46:59	Mussel25	do you think es3tag will perform better if dev1ce comes back into the team???
3:47:04	tvpwnzu	Cant even tell if people suggesting roster moves are joking or if they’re actually retarded
3:47:05	FourFN	@AkiroRaiden but to say its luck is unfair, he was a great player before he was picked up by astralis too he didnt just have a short stint of playin well during astralis and nothin b4 or after
3:47:05	PwnarN03	100% Mussel25
3:47:06	arlbergg	Would plopski or esetag get removed?
3:47:07	Sw3t_AtomiX	@jeffrocker1999 oh didnt know that
3:47:08	FarkYerh	rez played pretty good this tournament, he was kinda missing last game against gambit
3:47:08	kallebalik	+Brollan -Plopski
3:47:12	naegabeast	rez is so inconsistent
3:47:13	Hektic2	@arlbergg esetag
3:47:16	AstonVilla4Ever	-plopski
3:47:18	zaraine1	would be mega funny is esetag to fnatic LUL
3:47:20	LowRatedHighlander	KEKW
3:47:21	ZvedeENG	i mean REZ is the only one holding on NIP fans' attention with the newer lineups

3:47:24	DontBeSneakyTV	UKCS OMEGALUL
3:47:25	III3IIIEYEZIII	If you think rez is the problem your an idiot
3:47:26	Frede4900	@Mussel25 nah, esetag is the most overrated player of all time
3:47:28	jeffqed	@Timdengrove the whole narrative in interviews switched suddenly when hampus joined nip, previously he was always "yeah im a makeshift igl, id rather not" and even played with ex6tenz and then when he joined nip it was like "finally we have a real igl" like what
3:47:30	Ashas1991	cmonBruv fnatic
3:47:31	Hektic2	Esetag is the guy you put in for a bit and take out. that's all he's good for
3:47:32	LowRatedHighlander	Chat just refuses to listen to reason when it comes to plopski
3:47:33	Hektic2	KEKW

4:48:05	Andreer75	i feel like tier 2 tournaments is probably harder than alot of tier 1 tournaments
4:48:05	SheriffSteevo	@brander_crowned dont you hate when that happens
4:48:06	yup_cat	how do you get partnered?

4:48:23	cloutburstgg	tier 2 teams might get a win here and there against tier 1 competition but u dont always see a team like gambit
4:48:23	DraKoboiii	@cloutburstgg big lost to wisla, while dignitas have won against EG and Liquid

4:50:28	Mussel25	@Asambi people are calling navi garbage lmao
4:50:37	cloutburstgg	@DraKoboiii EG and liquid were extremely screwed up teams with team chem issues, mindset issues etc. Big has barely ever played wisla before. I guarantee wisla wouldnt be able to beat big again once big analyzes the issues. would be amazing if they consistently got to play against tier 1 teams, but currently i doubt most of these teams can consistently beat tier 1 opposition
4:50:37	Asambi	Haha Tru
4:50:46	kallebalik	It's hard to prepare for teams in these qualifiers

4:51:31	WarrenDon	yekindar's posture is trash
4:51:31	cloutburstgg	yeah thats true for sure
4:51:32	hobrev	today was a good example what all the online qualis are like, not just because of the upsets, this game started an hour late because of DDOS

5:47:44	Uwotm08	The usual thing to do is to just disqualify the cheating team and reinstate the team they last beat in their place. If the cheaters already lost it's debatable if it makes sense to have the team that beat them replay a match that they won.
5:47:46	Wojownixxx	what is going on?

6:19:39	LowRatedHighlander	@sm0kemeister ok but pay attention to that. Only a portion of those community sales goes to the prize pool. The other goes to valve. So if that’s funding the largest esports tournament in the world currently. surely you can make the assumption that it makes them quite a bit of money

6:37:19	visiblescout	take it off auto.  I think that fixes it for me

7:18:45	cloutburstgg	jks instead of shox @fl0m
