2:51:29	LowRatedHighlander	put it on slow mode and hope for the best
2:51:35	dirtnaztyyy	@scooch_the_noob wasnt a major
2:51:35	w0rmk1ll3r	scooch_the_noob major?
2:51:39	iHawk2k	Hey fl0m, i hope your doing well today <3
2:51:50	LowRatedHighlander	degens dodging slow mode in main chats wickedSTEER
2:51:52	uniqueabout	KEKW
2:51:56	theHovnival	But shroud hosting opens the door to costreamers, hopefully, and having more people see competitive CS that wouldn't otherwise.
2:52:00	Uwotm08	It was a major tournament, though, though not a Major major.
2:52:06	miguelODB	what was the prize pool of cologne?
2:52:14	Puddin_Wing	big ass win, not a major
2:52:14	BooomerNinja	1m prizepool
2:52:15	dnillo	1 mill i believe
2:52:17	theHovnival	So even though fl0m didn't host, it's still POGGIES for us
2:52:19	SpecterBoi24	782k viewers in the peak of stream at one point
2:52:19	Puddin_Wing	big win though

2:52:22	Uwotm08	$1M
2:52:23	n0r13k	viewership was excellent, I thought ESL did a great job.
2:52:35	SpecterBoi24	oh dam
2:52:35	JokerLuL	Im still shook that Warframe had 400k viewers yesterday. Didnt think it was that big of a game monkaS
2:52:39	tommytwoz	Does S1imple ever play any other FPS on stream or does he always grind CS?
2:52:40	SpecterBoi24	numbers are hard for me
2:52:45	c0rkmcnortis	i'm curious how the behind the scenes stuff went that ESL actually let him costream. Would be cool if they opened it up to more people
2:52:56	miguelODB	das crazy
2:52:58	jaschylar13	Cologne without the audience wasn't as exciting though. The crowd was the best part.
2:53:00	BooomerNinja	@tommytwoz He played valorant a very few times for fun
2:53:01	Chickenc0w	@SpecterBoi24 Another peaceful day without PEMDAS amirite?
2:53:06	Puddin_Wing	he's laser focused on cs as far as i know. you don't play at that level without being hella focused @tommytwoz
2:53:10	dirtnaztyyy	Boston Major greatest event ever
2:53:12	dnillo	s1mple likes to play warzone
2:53:13	Uwotm08	@JokerLuL did they count all the streamers that watched because of #ad including their viewerships?
2:53:14	Puddin_Wing	Like a little valorant, but that kid plays so much cs

2:53:20	schultzymo	@c0rkmcnortis thats what im wanting to know. it pisses me off that the NACS savior isn't allowed to stream it.
2:53:27	lylo_tv	Peeposit Wut da flom doin?
2:53:28	sealer9	Navi vs Liquid, Major final.. who do you want to win? s1mple first major or NA back on top again
2:53:37	SpecterBoi24	you know it @Chickenc0w, just don't tell my school. tryin be an engineer
2:53:42	ratJAM_	Pog ur so good flom
2:53:47	JokerLuL	@Uwotm08 that was off of just the actual Warframe stream itself not including the other streams.
2:53:54	Puddin_Wing	i'd rather see s1mple get a major honestly @sealer9 he deserves one
2:53:56	mern_eh	yooooooo papa's home fl0mHeart
2:54:02	c0rkmcnortis	schultzymo i mean id love to see fl0m get to stream it, but i get why if there's one person ESL picks it's gotta be shroud
2:54:05	Moobot	Please don't fill up the entire chat, @rzkk1 (warning)
2:54:05	Nightbot	@rzkk1 -> Back to square one. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
2:54:11	skyrayrat	why is he always playing ancient
2:54:16	w0rmk1ll3r	boys, we all know fl0m deserves the costream more than anyone but as a business shroud is the right choice as sad as it is
2:54:25	Chickenc0w	@SpecterBoi24 Yeah yeah no doubt. I mean if I'm being honest good stuff on those extra math problems you did for the last 3 days. WINKWINK ;)
2:54:31	uniqueabout	KEKW

2:54:37	sealer9	@Puddin_Wing that's the way i lean. guy deserves one so bad
2:54:38	schultzymo	@c0rkmcnortis yeah i understand that. They want the viewers and its definitely good for the CS scene in general.
2:54:38	n0r13k	is it weird that I don't want s1mple to win a major? I love that he's constantly trying to improve and I don't want him to drop off
2:54:40	JokerLuL	Ask fl0m about how much he loves mirage :)
2:54:41	lilspunkey	ancient best mapo

2:56:28	SpecterBoi24	@Chickenc0w the dean must be stream sniping for fl0m to be losing rounds like this

3:35:06	bluehipp0	it's the air/oxygen trapped in the water that causes it to not be clear

3:50:39	LucidR9	fl0m used to play hockey, you know how shitty it is to bring it up. He was injured and had the rest of his career taken away from him in the NGL. FFS.
3:50:40	infinite077	And in that moment valo fans were so happy and calling cs players a frog...
3:50:46	guigarb	now are 8 p.m in brazil
