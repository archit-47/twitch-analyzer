1:16:01	1parabellum1	Flash is ridiculous
1:16:02	Titansrage69	yeah 1st bullet so really good long range in certain situations
1:16:02	AcidRei8n	I taped my steelseries headset jus like urs LUL must be a common problem

1:36:52	Puddin_Wing	There are probably a wealth of good starter lessons series out there on the internet for free or close to it if you look hard enough. I started my whole music journey on piano, it's a great foundation for learning music theory @teish0

1:37:05	paadsung	hahahaha
1:37:07	Puddin_Wing	saving for a starter keyboard is doable, they're not that bad if you don't mind it not being like the world's best electric keyboard

1:46:49	Puddin_Wing	That's either the guitar or the cable. If I had to spitball with no other knowledge, the shielding of the electronics either in the guitar or the cable is shite or cracked. Is it a problem with any cable you try, or have you only tried the one @DullaTPG
1:47:09	westnilekyle50	LMFAOOO true
1:47:18	mpagasas123	are u gonna play with get right?
1:47:21	AIR02000	doesnt it now depend on video retention? As in how long people watch your vids?

1:47:45	dweevers	fl0m honestly I'm getting less and less videos of channels I'm subbed to in youtube, it's paapoWeird
1:47:48	Puddin_Wing	My experience is pretty atypical, so I wouldn't really base anything off my feedback. I didn't go to school for it, and just sorta happened into ending up doing it professionally. I fuckin love it most of the time. @therealkopojken

2:44:07	LowRatedHighlander	@chezpuf did you and Fl0m figure it out for silvercast or nah?
2:44:08	mukulhayaran	Hey guys, Had a tough day on CSGO. Four losses in a row because of toxic team mates, queued one last time and was happy to see that fl0m was on my team. With it being Vertigo, I was happy to have a good awper on my team - and having followed him for so many years it was gonna be great to play with him. When the game started he immediately disconnected, and we got pounded. Ended up abandoning after 7 rounds and I deranked. Is this normal?
