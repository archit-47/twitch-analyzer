5:56:41	yourducky	Suddenlink breaks their shit and theyre like
5:56:42	Puddin_Wing	if only someone could've predicted that playing xhaka on an island would lead to him making a shit decision and getting a red @Speedrulez
5:56:46	STatisfacti0n	and the dude that's come out both times has been awesome trying to go above and beyond to figure it out
5:56:49	yourducky	"yeah thats your fault and we're not going to even check"

5:57:16	Puddin_Wing	@w0rmk1ll3r yeah that's a fault shared by a lot of europe's leagues, unfortunately
5:57:42	Dynamo_Dave	@statisfacti0n I'm not trying to be rude but did you phone asking about it? they might be able to run tests remotely to test it. I live in the UK so it might be different
5:57:45	Puddin_Wing	he's just always been prone to making that mistake and getting that red immediately in games when he's on an island like that. Like.. we knew it'd happen @Speedrulez
5:57:45	yourducky	down goes dak OMEGALOOL
5:57:47	Puddin_Wing	it always does
