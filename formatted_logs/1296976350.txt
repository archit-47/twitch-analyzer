1:31:37	danishrhino	@vinciCS What about stuff like talent-leagues and academy rosters? And more orgs? I'm from EU so i don't know much about the NA scene, but i would think NA has the funds and possibility to build a strong foundation for new players, but so far i've seen little of that. Could be wrong, but it still saddens me that we see these massive talents on the NA rosters not live up to their potnetial
1:31:44	sleeeeppyyyy	GFYMeowMix mid is also a problem tbh
1:31:46	Exedra711	idk we've needed a cdm for ages
1:31:51	sleeeeppyyyy	GFYMeowMix bruno alone cant do shit
1:31:56	Brodosaur	i feel like the guys on col have the ethic right?

1:33:07	PeepoConnoisseur	KEKW
1:33:08	Exedra711	but idk what to expect anymore from the midfield in a given half
1:33:21	vinciCS	danishrhino I think NA has the funds, but not many orgs see it as a worthwhile investment anymore. What few orgs we have don't necessarily have the facilities or man power to also fund academy teams.
1:33:23	itsHAWKyotwitch	Americans are kinda lazy
1:33:43	sleeeeppyyyy	GFYMeowMix they need to get rid of fred and mctom. for some reason they are so obsessed with them

1:33:44	Foxtratte97	NA doesn't care about taking games seriously as much as the European population does, I think it's more of a culture thing
1:33:53	GFYMeowMix	McTominay is great
1:34:00	GFYMeowMix	Duck you mean
1:34:05	Chumbo767	what do you think about jdc standing in for bymas fl0m?

1:34:52	F1niteCS	@itsHAWKyotwitch still a Pepega generalization
1:34:53	mukulhayaran	SHEESH
1:34:55	vinciCS	danishrhino but its also what fl0m is saying, gaming culture is a lot different here than in EU. I think more NA players don't really see it as much of a viable career as perhaps in EU? THey would sooner go to streaming than playing professionally since its easier

1:36:23	danishrhino	@vinciCS This, and unfortunately as was said, the work ethic might also be possible causes. But idunno, imo there needs to be done something or NA will continue this devilish cycle of coming in hot for a minute and the start to fall flat. But i have my hopes up for a bright future where the international CS-scene will be even more competetive. That would honestly make it so much more entertaining and thrilling to watch the S-tier tournaments
