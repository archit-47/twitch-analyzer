1:40:53	BrycexD	Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Hitboy’s Hairline. My thesis is that Hitboy’s Hairline is receding by almost an inch every day. As an instinctive response, this makes Hitboy mad which supports my conclusion that Hitboy is in fact malding. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.
