2:55:38	macbookfps	wait i thought that pc ban was a troll
2:55:44	macbookfps	it's actually not?
2:55:47	Tvjuli	You can play and be good, but you will be more comfortable in 144
2:55:50	macbookfps	i just googled it monkaGIGA
2:56:06	colinggg	@theodoric98 60 is fine. preferably you want it as high as possible but 60 will certainly do
2:56:18	apodis10	it's just about like 3 alienware pcs because of noncompliant power supplies or something macbookfps
2:56:18	MaxofMine	@theodoric98 I played on my laptop that 48 FPS for years and then I got my gaming PC and 144hz monitor and I went up 2 ranks immediately

2:57:19	dweevers	chat... they're not banning gaming PCs in California
2:57:24	little_manga_reader	pro tip if you limit your fps to your refresh rate it's smoother
2:57:25	theodoric98	what about 240hz
