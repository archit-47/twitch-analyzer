2:30:55	thefl1pdof	"touch grass" is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments.

5:18:36	joshiiwa	sh1ro is a dev1ce type of awper. hate to see him so high on top5
5:18:37	LowRatedHighlander	I feel like niko is second though
5:18:43	messiah666rc	Niko has amazing stats the last 3 months, even more as a rifler. But all year, Zywoo has better stats
5:18:44	thespaceherpe	All this kid does is just hold a lame ass off angle with his deag and one clicks people in the side of the head CT side.

5:20:19	Turbo_Camry	Stewie #5 obvi
5:20:25	LowRatedHighlander	@lorenitus gambit had a better year than vitality and partly due to sh1ro
5:20:28	Madfish2021	@Lorenitus of course he can Gambit won a fair few tourneys this year
5:20:31	dnillo	all of navi except for boom will be top 20
5:20:32	Tango571	youre in my top 3 @fl0m right beside jesus
5:20:41	Arrivall	Who has the highest headshot %? Kappa

5:20:50	MrGarvin	hobbit could sneak in at 5 maybe?
5:20:50	Apollikratos	KEKW
5:20:55	the_kung	zywoo will definitely be n2 after s1mple, niko 3, sh1iro 4, elec 5
5:20:57	priiide_	dnillo im not sure abt perfecto. he might get edged out cause his stats arent incredible
5:21:01	Lorenitus	vitality is always zywoo vs the world. any accomplishment or high placing is solely due to zywoo.

5:37:41	FlameyKumori	@sleeeeppyyyy Also lot of the ones I would run into would be people playing super together, as if they were on a team, meanwhile my 5 stack is me and some friends just wanting to play together,

5:37:50	priiide_	@ChamposaurusWrex weak mentality so they lost everytime theyre down
5:37:59	LowRatedHighlander	I can understand the surrender sometimes but in games like Valorant and cs people are WAY too quick to give up

5:38:59	Sorrowbird90	@LowRatedHighlander People in Dota die once in the first 10 mins and they give up and start griefing everyone else KEK

5:39:22	ApexBaker	@LowRatedHighlander That's my roommate in LoL... feeds his lane 4 or 5 kills and gives up, calls for the FF. So annoying. He sucks.
5:39:22	Abioticcc	@LowRatedHighlander its true but sometimes when u have shitty teammates like u sure that they cant handle game to win surrender is better than wasting time u know

5:40:02	F1unkGG	for*
5:40:03	Sorrowbird90	@LowRatedHighlander Almost always yeah, in recent patches it's a bit harder to come back, but I agree, giving up so early is stupid
5:40:11	LowRatedHighlander	@apexbaker league is bad about it too

5:41:03	0TFtv	yo tell your admin to check appeals iv been waiting a response for a week already
5:41:04	G3RONlMO	@Apollikratos Oven then stove sear
5:41:07	iVex	You sear the inside
5:41:19	priiide_	arjunracing i dont even think the aloo gobi would be that bad nutrition wise. lotta veggies
5:41:19	The_Wombatman	I heard if you play with ptr it will make you go blind
5:41:21	Abioticcc	@LowRatedHighlander yes some people even on 5th round give up ad sayin gg in chat :/  this is not good i mean most of the times that happened with random mates we managed that game to comeback or even win
5:41:30	wallmanm	cook low and slow first then super hot in oven or on a cast irion pan to finish
5:41:30	waferthinmint	PTR still has a dragonlore instead of 1 million dollars in steam wallet
5:41:37	Apollikratos	Might just try that. Thank @G3RONlMO
5:41:49	JamesNeutron21	how long do you usually reverse sear a tomahawk for?

5:42:04	tysonz	i used to reverse sear but then i realized i always overcook the inside with residual heat :( just searing is so much easier imo
5:42:04	wallmanm	@JamesNeutron21 depends on the size of steak
5:42:29	wal_ko	why not picking ak's
5:42:29	arjunracing	@priiide_ that heavely ghee pool that floats to the top :O
5:42:36	cr0ssf1r3365	why would you not use a thermometer though? like I'd rather just get it right 100% of the time
5:42:49	bradhtv	thermometer is the way, dont let the boomers clown you
5:43:02	ChesterNugget	because it feels way cooler to be able to just know
5:43:03	FlameyKumori	surprised he had bullets left after how much he sprayed the mac10
5:43:03	priiide_	arjunracing true. imo its so worth it
5:43:08	Immortal1zed	the meat thermometer also measures your masculinity apparently
5:43:19	ChesterNugget	see, immortal gets it
5:43:37	G3RONlMO	It's conceptually an obvious way to go about it. You lose the nice sear texture if you sear first
5:43:38	waferthinmint	@cr0ssf1r3365 you gotta know your steak man, you gotta feel it, you gotta understand your meat, Its a part of you or will be. Cherish the steak and know its temp like you know your own heartbeat.
5:43:47	ninetyfivemonkeys	i got a digital multi-probe thermometer for xmas. so when im cooking for multiple people or multiple meats its so nice.

7:10:39	waferthinmint	@skyj_ idk, living in missouri we actually have a problem from soil depletion/industrial farming that is def caused mostly by soy production. The solution is just moving it other places and destroying their soil where more sustainable farming practices are used.

7:14:41	waferthinmint	@skyj_ its use in animal agriculture is a byproduct due to its cost rather than a motivator. If we relied on talo/Ghee/butter for oils even in cooking that would be a improvement on its own, rather than the oil production we rely on

7:17:04	waferthinmint	@dbz1h yeah thats fair, but I think the thing is, Animal agriculture when done right is sustainable as it produces fertilizer and allows for crop cycling and non soil depletion. But thats as far as my research has taken me

7:17:15	dbz1h	@waferthinmint this is the problem that is hard to solve. I let about 5 acres of our land go to hay and it gets rolled and set out for cattle during the winter. that 5 acres lasts a few cows a couple months

7:17:20	peepers_official	has anyone seen the chicken runboost
7:17:23	supahotfiyaaaaaaa	the thing with growing plants tho is that in the US we have drained our soil of nutrients so its getting harder to produce reliable yields without importing fertilizer from other countries

8:44:04	Ngtp	Just had my first day of work after getting over covid, covid was fine had a migraine for like 4 days and shivers for 2 anda sore throat for like 5 days, but after the shivers was basically 100%
8:44:15	GenericTim	you hate to miss those
8:44:16	ShallowSloth	hi ampela!
8:44:20	Puddin_Wing	he only showed symptoms because we got our boosters on sunday
8:44:23	budgetwaifu	@Puddin_Wing i got tested two days ago waiting for my results

9:44:27	HappyCow9	@1amdaredevil they show the exact line up needed, and most people do the map with the lines on, so they dont learn them. the key is to do them over and over untiil you can turn the lines off and do them 100% of the time. its just a lot of practice. also personal pref. ive always used them so im quite partial to them
