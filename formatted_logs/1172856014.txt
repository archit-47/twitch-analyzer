1:03:11	AggroWhispers	I wouldn't say people don't like to talk about it, but we're definitely conditioned not to. At least in the States
1:03:14	sillio	it was just subs money or with contracts as well?
1:03:15	STatisfacti0n	yeah, it's crazy how much emphasis people put on money. I'm just happy to see my favorite streamers doing well in life and living comfortably, getting to do the things they probably always wanted to do NODDERS
1:03:15	SABORx	i didnt understand why people made a big deal of the leak KEKW i did the math for how much timthetatman makes 3 years ago. even then he made millions a year. KEKW

1:28:03	FURIOUSSScs	lmao
1:28:09	vent_diver	that a1s speed coming in there
1:28:14	WRXorcist	@cake315 they changed it so EU matches weren’t starting at midnight if final went 5 maps
1:28:16	V1ZzxX	@fl0m dont kill opponenets just tag them to 1 shot
1:28:18	FURIOUSSScs	150 ping isnt hard to play at if ure used to it tbh

1:29:07	dadl0x	@V1ZzxX YES
1:29:13	WRXorcist	@cake315 I know, but EU were complaining about late finishing times so they changed that final to accommodate
1:29:17	rapid3yemovement	They're doing it for lol worlds as well...At least for the knockout round

3:33:40	ImTetro	its 4k if your tv supports it there are no 8k tv's that enough people own to justify streaming at that quality
3:33:42	BooomerNinja	@WookiePotamus All those cameras, still can't make the right call sometimes

So you crop that picture from your favourite anime, put a Make America Great Again hat on it and all of a sudden you start seeing yourself as that cute little anime girl.
3:56:16	WookiePotamus	if Lewis wins and max gets 2nd with the fastest lap I believe they tie

8:04:44	Speedrulez	fl0m you look like Peepo
8:04:59	Mountie888	is it a battlefield-esq ww2 shooter?

8:05:27	octoshark191	@Mountie888 It does have some similarities with Battlefield but has a lot of gameplay differences.
8:05:39	Doccy	since battlefield is more chaotic and arcade-y
8:05:42	Speedrulez	it looks like arma3 but less good
8:05:46	Speedrulez	and more easy to play
8:05:53	Speedrulez	MmmHmm
8:05:59	Kafkii	Arma 3 MmmHmm
8:06:04	AaronTheLeviathan	It is a Red Orchestra-esque shotoer
8:06:12	mr_17_five	That tank didnt find that funy Flom
8:06:13	Speedrulez	Germans lost remember
8:06:14	Speedrulez	MmmHmm
8:06:29	octoshark191	This game is more tactical and has a focus on authenticity and realsim.
8:06:33	sadkimples	Fl0m I don’t think running in a field like your running to 3rd party in fort nite is the play
8:06:37	Nick3306	@fl0m german tanks had more armor and a bigger gun but the shermans had much more mobility
8:06:45	Speedrulez	the German tanks were kinda stacked but also VERY hard to use
8:06:51	Doccy	germans had some god engineering yes
8:06:56	bunk3rk1ng	yeah the tiger tank was a beast
8:06:56	Doccy	good*
8:07:01	mrmonty_tv	german tanks were better but very heavy
8:07:03	Speedrulez	also couldnt deal with water and ice
8:07:04	Speedrulez	MmmHmm
8:07:04	Kafkii	Germans had some shitty naval forces though
8:07:14	octoshark191	@Speedrulez Yeah, the were built to be very strong but were likewise heavy and slow.
8:07:19	Speedrulez	Kafkii what about the Bismarck though MmmHmm
8:07:35	Doccy	imagine trying to beat the english navy and air forces
8:07:37	Doccy	KEKW
8:07:39	Nick3306	@bunk3rk1ng the tiger tanks were notoriously prone to breaking down. So many were abandoned.
8:07:53	Kafkii	Speedrulez you mean the ship that pooled a mass of resources and sank during the beginning of the war? MmmHmm

8:15:04	Kafkii	KEKW
8:15:25	Doccy	fl0m hates the game confirmed
8:15:27	Doccy	stripSad
8:15:32	AaronTheLeviathan	Def agree with them, the first two kits need to be instant unlocked, the LVL6 kits need to stay locked becasue they're actually just strong.

8:16:20	AaronTheLeviathan	LVL 6 AT gives you a buildable AT gun, its fucking bonkers
8:16:21	obiwancannol1	You can destroy any vehicle with two shots you have to hit weak points in the armor
8:16:21	Speedrulez	too slow progression?
8:16:34	obiwancannol1	basically you have to shoot tanks in the ass

8:16:41	peezyAIM	tarik3 tarik4
8:16:53	Nick3306	sides are weaker than the front but the back is the best
8:17:03	AaronTheLeviathan	@Speedrulez Progression to level 3 isn't bad, which is the first unlock, lvl6 and 9 are HELL
8:17:16	Kafkii	its usually always front, sides, back in terms of strenght MmmHmm

8:17:42	Speedrulez	if you are fighting the germans that is
8:17:45	AaronTheLeviathan	LVL6+ just have more powerful kits though, not added utility
8:17:50	STatisfacti0n	@fl0m GeT_RiGhT would be great to play with in this game
8:17:56	sadkimples	Noclip in the take and shoot them Peepo

8:18:14	Nick3306	@Speedrulez tigers were rarely used, the panzer IV was the most used german tank.
8:18:15	Speedrulez	also the BIGGEST prototype German tank ever was called the Maus (which is translated mouse) which is fucking funny
8:18:16	sadkimples	*tank
8:18:23	Speedrulez	Nick3306 true
8:18:28	Speedrulez	same story though
8:18:57	AaronTheLeviathan	The fastest way to level your kit in this game by the way, load in as an Engineer, build your nodes, redeploy as the Kit you want to level/play, and your Node XP will be given to taht kit so long as your nodes stay alive
8:19:12	Speedrulez	the Maus prototype got instabombed
8:19:13	Speedrulez	LUL
8:19:17	obiwancannol1	you should play beyond the wire if you get a chance
8:19:20	barnumbirr	vision is going blurry, fl0m had too much Wendys to run that much

8:19:59	Speedrulez	never really build it
8:20:01	Kafkii	it was developed
8:20:06	Speedrulez	was it really?
8:20:07	Kafkii	at the end of the war :)
8:20:10	Nick3306	@Kafkii im a fan of when the allies attached a flame thrower to a sherman

8:20:32	obiwancannol1	it wasn't a team kill, a grenade dropped on your dead body before you deserted
8:21:18	obiwancannol1	you can steal peoples kills that way if you see your teammate shoot someone you can shoot their body in the head and the kill counts for you
8:21:36	Kafkii	Speedrulez the tank was developed but then since it took so many resources they stopped putting resources into and once it was found the allies literally found it a waste oftime

10:07:04	WookiePotamus	woooooo BEARS won
10:07:17	cuantopoder	based on which defense type their tanks have you could choose to send on 17 or 16 but I think 17 would be the game
10:08:06	Doccy	bears vs who?
10:08:10	dootsyy	look at fl0m go chat
10:08:24	cuantopoder	also you can stack both butcher auras if one of them is upgraded so that would work nice with your upgraded tank
10:08:27	WookiePotamus	raiders doccy
10:08:38	Doccy	well of course the bears won then
10:08:44	Doccy	bears are stronger than people
10:08:50	Doccy	🐻
10:09:00	cuantopoder	yes
10:09:03	WookiePotamus	but raiders have swords
10:09:08	Doccy	you upgrade one
10:09:12	kenn1ld	No, you cant stack butchers. You can stack one butcher and one chef
10:09:13	Doccy	and leave the other un upgraded
10:09:19	Doccy	unless
10:09:24	cuantopoder	down right
10:09:24	Doccy	that doesn't work in this game
10:09:30	cuantopoder	against the sacred tank

10:10:45	cuantopoder	idk how to explain it but you have a sacred tank touching the upgraded butcher, so if U put a regular butcher on the back touching that tank you'll stack that aura
10:10:46	cuantopoder	same with AMP
10:10:52	Doccy	apparently if you pick a unit to send before the wave ends you get the income for that round

10:25:36	WookiePotamus	is there 3 or 2 this year ?
10:25:40	dootsyy	3 wild cards
10:25:44	huronvalley21	I doubt lions will get it.

10:26:06	Doccy	don't diss the bone warriors fl0m 💀
10:26:43	WookiePotamus	So I'm assuming the Cards win the division so Rams Panthers and Maybe the bears since there is 3
10:27:00	dootsyy	thats what im leaning towards
