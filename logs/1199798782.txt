[0:48:13] <CriticalRavi> Lucky was the only one even trying to show up against NiP. I agree, this was not due to him. At the same time, probably not ready for Astralis yet

[0:49:47] <LowRatedHighlander> @justchelsea2010 justho15Hi halooo
[0:49:50] <factor211> I think a player's performance is heavily tied to their name.  for example, xms would never be a star player, name isn't good enough.  k0nfig has a better name and is therefore a better player
[0:49:57] <TacticalAlmonds> @grimstrickly more like nobody likes anyone in that scene. it's why there are so many french shuffles
[0:49:59] <justchelsea2010> hey @lowratedhighlander how are you today?
[0:50:01] <WookiePotamus> @justchelsea2010 justho15Hi
[0:50:06] <playmoses> kenny to astralis ?
[0:50:07] <LuxionGames> id get kenny the fuck outta there after yesterdays jynxing Kappa
[0:50:07] <Kafkii> but malek is so good
[0:50:10] <Kafkii> Sadge
[0:50:11] <justchelsea2010> hii @wookiepotamus
[0:50:11] <JaYaJ> do we know when his contract expires?
[0:50:14] <hobrev> XTQZZZ, its supposed to be like extaz
[0:50:15] <JohnnyChance> we dont necessarily know if lucky is not the solution. hes had a pretty chaotic and checked out team environment his whole time there. so with the other four being stronger than hes experienced maybe he performs better.
[0:50:16] <CriticalRavi> It'd be very surprising to me if kennyS makes a strong comeback
[0:50:17] <c0rkmcnortis> I think a player's performance is heavily tied to their name. for example, xms would never be a star player, name isn't good enough. k0nfig has a better name and is therefore a better player

[0:50:23] <LowRatedHighlander> I’m doing ok how are you! @justchelsea2010 are you getting your arm checked out today?
[0:50:26] <sAmCaRam> nicoodoz to astralis?
[0:50:30] <LowRatedHighlander> Aren’t*
[0:50:30] <5Rule_> shox may fall off t1 team like scream did
[0:50:31] <n9nelashes> zywoo to g2 would be insane
[0:50:34] <AsSaSsInJ0HN> Shox GuardiaN Ropz
[0:50:36] <Kafkii> envy to pick up the french again
[0:50:39] <Tvjuli> Chat we all know you need a 1 in your name to be a top player
[0:50:40] <zellers4> your surfing with a chicken KEKW
[0:50:41] <ayezey> @c0rkmcnortis KEKW
[0:50:47] <brazzerschris> thats all fine, but how can ropz play on vitality, g2 and faze at the same time now?
[0:51:02] <Kafkii> Tvjuli zyw0o has a 0, checkmate
[0:51:04] <SukksGaming> I just want KennyS to costream with fl0m Sadge
[0:51:05] <TacticalAlmonds> Look at Rain, he played unreal during the event, but was lackluster during online era
[0:51:05] <BoomingBusiness> Tvjuli peepoHug
[0:51:11] <mk_48> @Tvjuli counter example: summ1g
[0:51:12] <apoodle10> there aren't any starplayers without numbers in their name, just cool at s1mple, dev1ce, zyw0o c0rkmcnortis
[0:51:21] <apoodle10> it's an agreed upon rule at this point
[0:51:28] <CriticalRavi> I hope he can get his mojo back, would be exciting
[0:51:29] <c0rkmcnortis> NODDERS that's why im c0ck
[0:51:30] <apoodle10> look at*
[0:51:38] <Tvjuli> Kafkii s1mple, sh1ro, dev1ce. And im out of examples but I win by default
[0:51:41] <CallsignColin> what do you think is more likely: kenny ending up on another tier 1 cs team or kenny leaving for valorant?
[0:51:41] <nithin0007> do u think g2 will make changes??
[0:51:43] <c0rkmcnortis> i mean c0rk
[0:51:47] <JohnnyChance> i dont care if they get teams, i just think kenny and tarik need to be in a buddy cop comedy together

[4:36:44] <LowRatedHighlander> nah that wasnt the problem for me
[4:36:46] <OGJunglist> @sakeesha but i mean what u get is 2cores and 8threads from the upgrade, and better cache... if your 9600k is lacking rn then its worth it, if not u can always get 9900k cheaper later
[4:36:49] <Kafkii> consider it said
[4:36:49] <LowRatedHighlander> with the too many main characters
[4:36:50] <jrudzewicz> its from qdoba MmmHmm
