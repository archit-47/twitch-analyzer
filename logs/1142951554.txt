[2:24:44] <STatisfacti0n> @memecabinetdan I mean, to be fair a game like this gets super stale super quick if they don't add shit. just look at OW and how often they had to roll new shit out to keep it fresh. CS gameplay is pretty timeless
[2:25:07] <cudaddv2> !Rank
[2:25:07] <Nightbot> Fl0m is an ex-pro player who now streams full time. He is Rank S in ESEA and in FPL on FACEIT. His matchmaking rank is Global Elite (boosted by GTR). He is also Diamond something or other in VALORANT and Rank #1 in fucking dads. But no matter what, he will always be Rank #1 in our hearts smileW
[2:25:33] <macbookfps> rocket is 49
[2:25:36] <macbookfps> how much is each satchel?
[2:25:40] <macbookfps> like 10?
[2:25:54] <cudaddv2> Is this the new gamer map?
[2:25:58] <macbookfps> yep new map
[2:26:02] <cudaddv2> Noice
[2:26:06] <dweevers> macbookfps no team damage on satchels anymore
[2:26:12] <macbookfps> @dweevers oh really?
[2:26:17] <memecabinetdan> @statisfacti0n Yeah, it’s more for me things like ancient not getting updated a bunch to bring it up to spec that bug me. It’s not even big things I want
[2:26:22] <FletcherB10> like junkrat
[2:26:34] <dweevers> macbookfps yeah they took it out a couple patches ago

[2:26:54] <macbookfps> can we close gamba?
[2:26:56] <macbookfps> modCheck
[2:26:56] <dweevers> NODDERS Fattz808
[2:27:05] <LowRatedHighlander> i think the big thing that gets me is that CS takes years to get very basic stuff that would help its scene grow. like how long it took to get an actual unranked playlist so that new players can actually learn the game in a non comp environment
[2:27:07] <redsox4evur> don't let me down boys. modCheck
[2:27:11] <STatisfacti0n> @memecabinetdan well part of that is they have to roll things out and then collect data on them before making changes. not sure if you've ever tried making a map before but it's certainly not "easy". not saying you're claiming it is but it's stuff that does take time. however, I too get sad how little Valve seems to care at times
[2:27:17] <cudaddv2> This map os down bad
[2:27:18] <FletcherB10> finlands gift to esports

[2:28:36] <LowRatedHighlander> i do like cs's method of adding maps. basically force feed it to everyone so they can get valid data on it

[2:29:46] <sigmis_> VALORANT is the most eco-friendly game with how much recycled content they use when making their maps
[2:30:08] <Kafkii> i just realized zedd is higher ranked than tucker
[2:30:16] <Kafkii> by like a lot
[2:30:24] <batsbanaan_> You think cs will ever make it when you que while playing dm?
[2:30:47] <STatisfacti0n> @batsbanaan_ you can already do that
[2:30:53] <macbookfps> %? fl0m's team gets 13-0'd
