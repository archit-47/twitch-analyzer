[3:47:15] <siDDziy> I simply cannot believe my son is watching thousands of people typing nonsense in this chat. It is disturbing that small children today get influenced by it and type garbage like “LUL” & “KEKW”. What does it even mean and how do you find it funny? What do all of you people get by typing all day in chat? Grow up everybody and get a life

[4:45:50] <apoodle10> irc was pretty dope, because you would only play with people who were stress resistant enough to set up irc
[4:45:51] <LucidR9> BuSheeZy sorry for asking you in server if it was you, I didn't mean to bother you
[4:45:52] <Inversion101> idk if laus right on this one, if im gambit I wouldnt rather have played against liquid after watching that match

[4:46:50] <SinisterAlleys> Who are these casters
[4:46:50] <LucidR9> I honestly think s1mple calling liquid a dead team that he lost to was more him shitting on himself than shitting on liquid
[4:46:55] <LucidR9> scrawny and launders
[4:47:02] <LukeryD> of all the teams navi lose to, they lose to liquid?

[4:47:30] <n01kn0wz5> @LucidR9 did he actually say that?
[4:47:30] <AnnoyinMercenary> youtube had 50k concurrent, didn't see twitch @fl0m
[4:47:33] <LucidR9> it just means roster changes are coming
[4:47:36] <LucidR9> and everyone knows
[4:47:44] <Inversion101> did s1mple call them bad?
[4:47:46] <LucidR9> people dont understand what "dead team" in this context means
[4:47:50] <Inversion101> or just call them a dead team
[4:47:52] <crunchy1991> idk why people talk bad about valorant its good that game exist because it will make valve work harder since they have competition
[4:48:00] <Inversion101> because they are a dead team
[4:48:00] <k1bsTV> @fl0m What did you order?
[4:48:01] <LowRatedHighlander> Just a dead team
[4:48:02] <STatisfacti0n> messyhair is on the phone behind me talking spanish and I'm the real life embodiment of HmmmOK

[4:48:03] <SupraUK_> @LucidR9 fl0mAWP
[4:48:04] <LucidR9> he called them a dead team, which as I said I think he more means that he played poorly

[5:13:42] <RhinoIsSus> They beat Navi tho
[5:13:43] <SinisterAlleys> Let's not kid ourselves had they lost inferno we all would've cried.
[5:13:46] <RhinoIsSus> thats all that matters KEW
[5:13:46] <Junior_Math> :tf: I am invincible
[5:13:50] <Junior_Math> D:
[5:13:51] <shutthafoxup> They can't catch a break
[5:13:52] <future_jason> we've watched MLG Columbus, I've seen the worst already COPIUM
[5:13:56] <Morde24> I can hurt you fl0m, they aren't breaking up, they are switching to val
[5:13:56] <DashX239> maybe stavn is a secondary igl or something
[5:13:57] <justdanny> this copium tank is full and ive already paid for the refills for this tourney. UNTOUCHABLE
[5:14:00] <GoIdenBirb> they'll rematch navi in the final GROUPIUM
[5:14:02] <papadiaj> just keep resigning liquid on 2 week contracts so they are always about to break up
[5:14:02] <Junior_Math> this is rough
[5:14:06] <l3ordon> When does this liquid team officialy disband? or is that unknown>
[5:14:07] <akexecution> do u think borup has any hard feelings playing with the guys who replaced him?
[5:14:10] <RhinoIsSus> Im all out of copium nothing scares me anymore @fl0m
[5:14:15] <DavieWhy> oh boy, I can't wait to watch Navi continue their dominant streak
[5:14:16] <JxFriz> I didn't watch the match was it liquid playing nuts, navi playing bad or a bit of both?
[5:14:20] <TauuuCS> borup soon to be cooper
[5:14:24] <koppertonekid> wtf borup?

[5:34:42] <Inversion101> could get someone from cph flames maybe, only thing I can think of then. Didnt know their rules were that strict kinda dumb
[5:34:42] <Schneider________________> Can you explain how blast esl etc works? Why not just one like nfl? @fl0m

[5:34:55] <yuseppi> He’s a 10k Andy
[5:35:08] <LowRatedHighlander> @schneider________________ it’s an open circuit. Not franchised
[5:35:14] <easternexamination> wtf are these dead fucking t sides by both teams wtf
[5:35:18] <HeyKroZ_> peepoSit
[5:35:19] <Spider22Monkey> So if Tarik wasn't apart of the team but still a streamer for the org would he have been able to costream?
[5:35:22] <Morde24> @schneider________________ it's an open circuit and HLTV manages the rankings. there are qualifiers and invites
[5:35:29] <grenmon2202> b0rup was an ex player dont know what else chat needs in a "stand-in"
[5:35:32] <Melted_iOS> what's the reason stavn isn't here?
[5:35:33] <future_jason> should get Tenz Kappa
[5:35:41] <DavieWhy> calling it they get ecoed this round
[5:35:44] <jbirdblue> I don't speak Danish per se but I did eat a danish for breakfast, so while its not the best fit i think i can meet the needs of Heroic
[5:35:46] <ScoutPack151> @easternexamination A1-S overpowered Kappa
[5:35:50] <Sealer9> stavn out for personal reasons i think
[5:35:54] <duplicate__> Didn't b0rup play in Fall Showdown aswell? How does that work? @fl0m
[5:35:55] <Inversion101> right but there needs to be an expiration or something, I mean tarik still being affected is ridiculous
[5:35:59] <Aaromiee> will tarik comeback to cs?
[5:36:05] <future_jason> fl0m he's just taking a dump we know Kappa
[5:36:06] <Morde24> @jbirdblue KEKW

[5:37:09] <elblanco744> peepoWalk
[5:37:10] <TecchSupp0rt> Borup was on Mad Lions for Fall Showdown, so wouldnt that rule him out? Clearly not, but surely?
[5:37:13] <grenmon2202> do players receive less money on the bench. seems kinda dumb to pay people to do nothing
[5:37:14] <Booooooolin> peepoWalk
[5:37:15] <0nze0> @Inversion101 cause he signed the contract
[5:37:19] <LowRatedHighlander> @inversion101 players can still switch teams otherwise konfig wouldn’t be able to play on astralis in blast events
[5:37:20] <BeanosTV> I think Lamar Odom is still signed by the lakers but hasnt played since 2017 lol

[6:34:21] <LowRatedHighlander> @doccy !!!!! Guess what
[6:34:21] <pzode> Wait, if Heroic did it and lost the round, can't you let Gambit have it? Should be a penalty for doing it
[6:34:23] <Inversion101> teses mald pepelaugh
[6:34:26] <ree_dash> i missed that shit TT
[6:34:28] <Junior_Math> that makes no sense, they lost
[6:34:30] <glow2007> Lol i saw that
[6:34:32] <heisenburgblu> It’s the mid one
[6:34:32] <ChesterNugget> true
[6:34:36] <Doccy> WAT? stripGo
[6:34:37] <McBubba03> fl0mSlam BS
[6:34:39] <Treefi> Yo ez run it back
[6:34:40] <premiumsaltbonds> 50 damage penalty to the other team
[6:34:40] <DavieWhy> Penalties don't make sense
[6:34:41] <humdrum9> wait, what happened?
[6:34:42] <BizarreMark> pepeSus I always knew liquid cheated, there is no way they beat navi
[6:34:42] <flames2802> Pass interference 15 yrds
[6:34:45] <ThunderVikiing> thats stupid that they have to replay it
[6:34:45] <premiumsaltbonds> Still first down
[6:34:46] <badchopper> HER OMEGALUL IC
[6:34:47] <pzode> That's a stupid implementation of the rule
[6:34:47] <EINacho> can heroic throw it on purpose?
[6:34:49] <BadWolf_bad> Team Liquid molly?
[6:34:51] <stormshitman> dude fuck that id straight tell em to fuck right off
[6:34:52] <ThePhvraoh> yeah I feel like gambit getting fucked here
[6:34:52] <a732v> Get Michael Masi to decide
[6:34:53] <scalpemnoles> so you can throw an illegal molly just to reset a losing round??
[6:34:53] <inzert15> word.exe -molly
[6:34:53] <quaazzy> 10x better
[6:34:54] <Schneider________________> football but when a flag is thrown against opponent you replay with no penalty what?? @fl0m
[6:34:54] <heisenburgblu> That’s just wrong wtf
[6:34:55] <boredillinoisan> thats dumb af
[6:34:56] <trashthalk> So if you're 1v5 you can just throw an illegal molly and reset the round?
[6:34:56] <ohmissyme> Agreed - you should be able to decline it!
[6:34:56] <Chezpuf> so you're about to lose the final round of the game, just throw an illegal molly to get it replayed???
[6:34:56] <Junior_Math> why not just throw that molly any round you are losing?
[6:34:56] <bev1nn> someone call Thorin we got a boo-boo
[6:34:58] <LowRatedHighlander> sqwiddHug @doccy
[6:34:58] <retepyalc> so if youre losing you just throw that molly and get a free redo?
[6:35:02] <nanerpus_> No, teams should have no say in the rules and how they are applied @fl0m
[6:35:02] <Rinm> ''rules''
[6:35:02] <heisenburgblu> That a dumb fucking rule
[6:35:03] <JonEOD> Did you see the F1 drama ?
[6:35:05] <stormshitman> @trashthalk exactly
[6:35:07] <Doccy> laynaWAH
[6:35:08] <pzode> Couldn't Heroic do it again if they are losing a round to replay it? Bad precedent
[6:35:10] <McBubba03> Illegal Molly Offense number Cadian, 10 yard penalty, automatic first down. Kappa
[6:35:11] <Doccy> stripHug
[6:35:12] <EdgyKommunist> so if you lose a round just throw the glitch molly 5Head
[6:35:13] <ohmissyme> @retepyalc right!
[6:35:17] <humdrum9> what is an illegal molly?
[6:35:20] <ChesterNugget> the Sportsman thing would be for Heroic to throw the round and give it back @fl0m
[6:35:21] <LowRatedHighlander> How are you this morning doccy
[6:35:21] <apoodle10> accepting / declining penalties would be way better
[6:35:24] <Merp212> while they do have to adhere to the rules, i think thats stupid because they lost so its not like itll help gambit out at all
[6:35:25] <glow2007> Agree
[6:35:26] <heisenburgblu> Blast just when we thought you were gonna win best talent.
[6:35:27] <ealansari> so whenever a team thinks they lost a round they can just throw that molly to replay it YEP
[6:35:31] <Doccy> i am okay
[6:35:34] <Doccy> slept in
[6:35:35] <javo_> so if I'm 1v5 against navi I could throw that illegal molly and get the round replayed? KEKW
[6:35:36] <a732v> what is the issue?
[6:35:42] <BizarreMark> peepoCool / hey doccy
[6:35:43] <checkisbadd> Lose pistol? No problem throw illegal Molly lol
[6:35:45] <gamerwill_> so you're telling me that if a player is in a 1v4 and just goes and throws the illegal molly it can force a replay? kinda messed up.
[6:35:45] <LowRatedHighlander> Good you probably needed it doccy
[6:35:46] <McBubba03> javo_ SeemsGood
[6:35:47] <grannyz_tuna> what happend
[6:35:50] <oTTV_BTW> it would make things go faster
[6:35:53] <Rinm> fl0mP_SG  dont think i missed anything
[6:35:54] <pzode> I'd love a replay of the molly
[6:35:56] <CormaggBH> like a free play offsides call in football
[6:35:56] <pzode> What is it?
[6:35:59] <spiddLEz> when doesnt heroic cheat tho?
[6:36:00] <Chezpuf> fl0m so you're about to lose the final round of the game, just throw an illegal molly to get it replayed???
[6:36:02] <Schneider________________> how can you do something illegal and then the illegal play team gets to replay the round they lost??? @fl0m
[6:36:03] <heisenburgblu> That doesn’t make sense

[6:38:46] <BizarreMark> peepoW pasha vs blame
[6:38:46] <Semiproshark7> that one
[6:38:47] <heisenburgblu> I think if you look interz purposely took damage from it so they could call it. @fl0m
[6:38:47] <kronicgod17> so what the hell happens if you throw that on accident trying to molly mid on the run?
[6:38:51] <nuxvo> f
[6:38:52] <glow2007> Yeah its that molly I noticed it
[6:38:53] <Merp212> did the TO notice that or did heroic admit to doing it and the TO said to redo the round?
[6:38:58] <wAllCS> Did heroic cheat again? Keepo
[6:39:04] <ChesterNugget> If replaying the round, the team that lost the previous round should throw the round and give it back.  Drop mollies on themselves at spawn
[6:39:04] <Sun__House> scrawny literally named scrawny talking about fighting people in the cage lmao
[6:39:06] <glow2007> Does do a fair bit of damage to a B rush too
[6:39:07] <premiumsaltbonds> Great drama keep it up Blast.
[6:39:08] <BizarreMark> NOPERS gambit did
[6:39:11] <SukksGaming> @kronicgod17 Thats a really small chance
[6:39:13] <milad_1234_1234> what happened????
[6:39:15] <ciaistrash> Chat what happened?
[6:39:21] <premiumsaltbonds> word.exe
[6:39:21] <Junior_Math> @nialll Heroic threw an illeagal molly, so they are replaying the round. but Heroic lost the round
[6:39:22] <Chezpuf> fl0m good explanation of molly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:39:23] <ealansari> widepeepo
[6:39:29] <s1mply_ant> Its a crazy molly though
[6:39:29] <oTTV_BTW> this is like the ump warming both benches after the pitcher throws at the batter
[6:39:29] <stormshitman> id refuse to play the game out iof they dotn give them the round
[6:39:31] <5imon_has_swag> This is like the Brazilian Cypher Cam
[6:39:31] <Milamie> just came back what happened?
[6:39:32] <cyanideaddict_> mens what happened?

[6:39:40] <nialll> thanks @Junior_Math what was the molly?
[6:39:41] <Morde24> fl0m so you're saying this was an Unfortunate Series of Events?

[6:39:58] <Chezpuf> the molly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:39:58] <Chezpuf> the molly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:39:59] <Inversion101> imo they should just give a round to gambit on addition to the one they already won
[6:39:59] <Chezpuf> the molly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:39:59] <ohmissyme> This is what is happening: GAMBIT is being punished for HEROIC violating a rule.  How does that make any sense?
[6:40:01] <imrooty> call the race director ;)
[6:40:09] <jockst3r> thats dumb

[6:41:36] <Doccy> nice peepoClap
[6:41:37] <lilbambi19> @lilbambi19 damn homie
[6:41:37] <inzert15> replay would set a really bad precedent. like you can throw this in a lost round and than you replay the round
[6:41:38] <Sealer9> Heroic is on ct side I thought the Molly was for t’s advantage?
[6:41:39] <mynamesjohnnie> @fl0m what’s good glom how u going

[6:42:03] <Morde24> CASTER START THE GAME
[6:42:04] <pzode> Heroic don't even get a penalty for it tbh. They'd be in the same position either way
[6:42:04] <dankiyy> who threw the molly pepeSus
[6:42:04] <oTTV_BTW> watch lol restart at 0-0
[6:42:07] <stormshitman> 10 minutes for that to be decided

[6:42:24] <pzode> I'd love a system where rule breaking like that loses you a round, or a loss of money at the start of a round
[6:42:24] <wisper67> does anybody have clip of the molotov? i missed it
[6:42:33] <Chezpuf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:42:34] <raimundo821> no decision was great choice. momentum lost if anything

[6:47:26] <retepyalc> I love pro-level vertigo
[6:47:28] <dankiyy> tig ol bitties OOOO
[6:47:30] <megaganj> #1 vertigo team easy
[6:47:35] <megaganj> imo
[6:47:36] <DarkArrow576> isnt heroic the best team on vert?
[6:47:44] <DarkArrow576> not heroic. gambit
[6:47:45] <Chezpuf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBwYv26dAx8
[6:47:45] <RendJCD> oof borup through it
[6:47:48] <Ultimate_Jammer> he was not punished?
[6:47:49] <Chezpuf> the molly
[6:47:51] <Uwotm08> @fl0m I can't read, the Regional Championship I mentioned earlier was HCS, not CS:GO. Disregard. ESL Challenger is TBD
[6:47:58] <giraffemofo> and it hits below
[6:47:59] <messipeek_fellaini> heroic threw it?
[6:48:04] <RendJCD> maybe he didnt know?
[6:48:05] <lo33y> Okay, I had entered it in alot earlier, it just was delayed af. Really bad wifi.
[6:48:06] <dypcy> oh yes its not illegal in faceit :>
[6:48:06] <hunter6925> RIOT HERE haHAA TECH PAUSE NEEDED haHAA
[6:48:07] <Morde24> Gambit has very much dropped off similar to Navi on nuke
[6:48:12] <dankiyy> borup is probably also the only person whos rough with the rulebook, unlucky
[6:48:18] <Lordwen> @messipeek_fellaini ofc it's a CT molo
[6:48:22] <DarkArrow576> who else is good? vitality?
[6:48:27] <glow2007> Makes a wall of flames under B lul
[6:48:34] <ShmetRT66> didnt entropiq beat their vertigo once
[6:48:34] <Chezpuf> @Ultimate_Jammer no, because they lost the round
[6:48:35] <messipeek_fellaini> @messipeek_fellaini thx
[6:48:37] <heisenburgblu> i think he did that on purpose
[6:48:38] <ninetyfivemonkeys> I THINK WE CALL THAT A !WHIFF FL0M

[6:48:40] <sphhax> @RendJCD are you saying he didnt know he was throwing a molly lineup or that he didnt know it was against the rules. because either way it's still his fault
[6:48:42] <DesiredHeadshot> csgo needs some fixing
[6:48:47] <Ultimate_Jammer> @Chezpuf OMEGALUL SO BAD
[6:48:48] <SpartanJack_> it burns invisible underneath as well so you only know if you start taking phantom damage
[6:48:50] <BooomerNinja> Navi hasn't dropped off on Nuke as much as teams have caught up to their ways
[6:48:59] <Nerdskiii> is it not worth throwing each round then as it hits top and below, seems pretty op?
[6:49:02] <AnnoyinMercenary> VP is decent
[6:49:03] <crypt1ci_i> liquid?
[6:49:03] <two_drop> @fl0m is the bouncing Molly still allowed on Ancient? Was that patched?
[6:49:07] <TrvsF> is liquid still good on vert?
[6:49:07] <Junior_Math> Mythic
[6:49:08] <RendJCD> navi doesnt play vert right?
[6:49:10] <gLH_TV> furia used to be good at vertigo
[6:49:12] <DarkArrow576> copenhagen decent at it at major
[6:49:12] <glow2007> Nah its not invisible
[6:49:13] <Morde24> @booomerninja it's the same thing from the perspective of who is the best
[6:49:19] <salman_alik> vs fnatic
[6:49:22] <Schneider________________> who you think best on ancient @fl0m
[6:49:26] <mynamesjohnnie> @fl0m did they stream the games before the final I missed them all some how makes me sad

[6:49:53] <crypt1ci_i> nip "loves" ancient
[6:49:55] <lickwed_snek> why is it navi perma ban
[6:49:55] <mooselampa> Mythic looks real good on Ancient Kappa
[6:49:55] <Morde24> then we realized NIP can look strong or shit on any map
[6:49:57] <RendJCD> FaZe like to play it
[6:49:58] <lo33y> @Nerdskiii It barely damages the bottom floor. But yeah it is worth throwing as it gives info as to whether or not they are rushing spiral
[6:50:03] <salman_alik> this studio is lit
[6:50:04] <doublexpwiikend> faze seemed good on it
[6:50:04] <v1495> OZ

[6:50:40] <Doccy> riot never updates csgo any more they just focus of overwatch now. sadge
[6:50:41] <BooomerNinja> They pay those devs in cases as well YEP
[6:50:42] <NebChilly> pure larceny
[6:50:43] <tdbluecup> well think about how much they must pay them
[6:50:43] <mellerby604> Fanatic on ancient
[6:50:43] <ealansari> !1deag
[6:50:44] <Nightbot> ealansari pops a 1deag on synclarity 1TAP
[6:50:46] <Schneider________________> is there a reason valve ignores the game so much?
[6:50:48] <giraffemofo> huge profit
[6:50:51] <cronican> too many cooks imo
[6:50:57] <stockus> tech company - work fast and break shit :P
[6:50:58] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @Schneider________________ uh? its perfect?
[6:51:00] <peat_shack> Extra Salt is 80% on vertigo :P
[6:51:01] <DarkArrow576> better strat to perma ban a map and only play 6 or ban per matchup?
[6:51:03] <salman_alik> why do you think they care less about csgo as compared to dota
[6:51:09] <Uwotm08> Is that the molly you illegally bounce off the skybox, which resets its flight lifetime?
[6:51:11] <Chezpuf> @Schneider________________ it's hard to make meaningful changes to spaghetti code
[6:51:14] <EdgyKommunist> good thing I spent 200€ on cases last month to support those 4 people
[6:51:16] <dankiyy> they dont care they got steam money PepeLaugh
[6:51:21] <Doccy> most of the gme devs they have want to work on dota
[6:51:25] <Uwotm08> It's only banned in Blast, other tournaments allow it. (Valve should fix the bug.)
[6:51:29] <NebChilly> wonder how many devs they have on dota
[6:51:30] <Doccy> or other new projects
[6:51:30] <Dzoja2344> csgo has more updates a year then developers which is really sad
[6:51:32] <k3lay> I mean cs is in a pretty good spot
[6:51:35] <k3lay> imo
[6:51:39] <PottsnPannz> Theres a good write up about Half Life: Alyx development thats really eye opening
[6:51:40] <dankiyy> also all valve devs work on whatever project they want
[6:51:43] <stormshitman> gabens also a very fat dota enjoyer :) who hates cs
[6:51:47] <TheGreaterFool> I dont understand the amazon reference
[6:51:48] <priiide_> how frequently does dota get patches
[6:51:52] <priiide_> or at least balance patches
[6:51:52] <apoodle10> i wonder how many people have 'artifact dev' in their resume
[6:51:55] <jwaz3303> @fl0m wait there is 4 devs for all valve games or 4 or csgo?
[6:51:57] <two_drop> So does the bug Molly still exist on ancient?
[6:51:57] <ceesidd> thats quite interesting
[6:51:57] <Bearnardoh> but valve cant hire developers to do the job of improve their games?
[6:52:04] <Chezpuf> any devs in chat looking to work for Volvo modCheck

[6:52:47] <TheGreaterFool> I get it

[6:53:02] <siDDziy> funmt
[6:53:03] <two_drop> According to various sources, Valve is the most profitable company in the world *per employee.* They barely have any employees compared to their revenue.
[6:53:05] <siDDziy> A
[6:53:06] <GroGriFF> its like mcdonalds being a real estate business more so than a burger restaurant
[6:53:12] <Schneider________________> why don't they just outsource dev work to a company? @fl0m
[6:53:17] <dankiyy> no one wants to fix the spageht

[6:54:49] <stormshitman> mollies with no smokes
[6:54:50] <Doccy> @NebChilly no the engine has gone through several rebuilds
[6:54:51] <mozkio2000> worst CS was c. zero
[6:54:54] <huronvalley21> glitches everywhere
[6:54:56] <td_gg> its look completely different visually too
[6:54:56] <mooselampa> p90 was a lazer
[6:54:57] <Wyngless> Valve is still a private company?
[6:55:01] <Chezpuf> slow mollys were ass
[6:55:01] <rrumack> LMAO He is just saying that b/c NIP was GOATED
[6:55:02] <naqqqqqq> so you think CS will come back or die?
[6:55:02] <Uwotm08> @Wyngless Yep
[6:55:03] <TheOnlyWookie> it was made for consoles lmao
[6:55:10] <lickwed_snek> @Wyngless yes
[6:55:11] <huronvalley21> Lets talk about condition-zero
[6:55:14] <DIkktudo> p90 was the best weap?
[6:55:15] <NebChilly> @Doccy its still on source engine though right?
[6:55:15] <SukksGaming> Wasnt there a random discount for some guns?
[6:55:16] <trashthalk> Plus no skins D:
[6:55:21] <leeon_ua> @mozkio2000 i loved the one that had a campaign. it was great
[6:55:22] <gLH_TV> Remember AWP Speed? KennyS was a GOD @fl0m
[6:55:24] <Wyngless> Oh... Oh yeah, Gabe is in an entirely different dimension then
[6:55:25] <awshuckz> no reason to take it public, they don't need to raise any money
[6:55:25] <indoor_klimmert> greazy3HEY
[6:55:27] <huronvalley21> CZ-invite hell yeah
[6:55:27] <Chezpuf> gaben worth $4 billion
[6:55:27] <dankiyy> give back the galil acog Rainge
[6:55:30] <thestonet> !uptime
[6:55:31] <Nightbot> 6 hours 55 minutes 46 seconds
[6:55:32] <lickwed_snek> GabeN
[6:55:32] <siDDziy> Steam is huge
[6:55:34] <Uwotm08> @rrumack NIP became best after the worst glitches were fixed. P90 nerfed, and mollies weren't even used by pro teams in the early times.
[6:55:35] <DavieWhy> Are twitch streamers considered private?
[6:55:35] <Doccy> it's a mix of the 2010's source engine and source 2
[6:55:37] <curpyx> fl0m are you pugging today
[6:55:38] <Inversion101> I mean thats how it is in valorant rn, molly is cheap af and some agents get 2 and they're unextinguishable
[6:55:44] <lickwed_snek> GabeN buy skins GabeN
[6:55:45] <guv_chopper> does valve own steam?
[6:55:47] <SukksGaming> Source was great Sadge
[6:55:48] <GeorgeLincolnRockweII> FUCKGAB3N
[6:55:48] <Flirtatious_Cheese> !cd
[6:55:53] <omrat> @guv_chopper bruh
[6:55:58] <owpog> is steam a creation of valve @fl0m
[6:55:59] <naqqqqqq> cause with Val, people said CS was dead but now it feels like it's coming back a bit. So do you think there is room for both or only one?
[6:55:59] <Doccy> the 2010's source engine being the engine portal 2 runs on
[6:56:00] <Uwotm08> @DavieWhy Private company means not publicly listed on a stock exchange.
[6:56:02] <0nze0> sjuushd lived there and gopt a kill, wtf
[6:56:05] <huronvalley21> Lets not forgot CAL-d either
[6:56:07] <gLH_TV> @fl0m remember AWP movement speed? KennyS was a god running with it
[6:56:10] <siDDziy> Like ufc and the fighters
[6:56:12] <Doccy> which is very very different from the 2000's source engine
[6:56:14] <omrat> good night guys, it's midnight and I have school tomorrow
[6:56:26] <DavieWhy> @Uwotm08 Yea so I was wondering if fl0m brand is in that category
[6:56:27] <dankiyy> bandwagon peepoJuice
[6:56:27] <kronicgod17> damn so you payin all the SS huh fl0m
[6:56:29] <mozkio2000> @leeon_ua campain was great but online... an other story
[6:56:33] <Doccy> a note that apex and titan fall runs on the source engine
[6:56:33] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @omrat gnid MLADY

[6:56:46] <Chezpuf> csgo is also a mod of another game, so there's a lot of spaghetti code that's hard to change
[6:56:46] <ekstraLUV> they are basically insecure children mentally
[6:56:54] <dankiyy> they are all f2p now anyways
[6:56:59] <leeon_ua> @mozkio2000 i haven't played online
[6:57:00] <sergluna> which is crazy, its video games. just play it if its fun keep doing it
[6:57:03] <dillan_is_chilling> i still play Mordhau LULW
[6:57:04] <Doccy> a modified source engine but it still is the same as csgos
[6:57:08] <brownbabby> try it. if you enjoy something, then do it
[6:57:11] <Madfish2021> @fl0m play Pokemon
[6:57:13] <Tarbak> is this game worth getting out of?
[6:57:14] <SukksGaming> I played csgo for over 1000 hours. It was worth the 15 bucks
[6:57:15] <fhilcollins> I still play source whatever broseph

[6:57:29] <C_Banshee> 2000 hours later, 15 dollars well spent
[6:57:29] <DIkktudo> i needed 100 hour to get gold
[6:57:30] <grucifer33> grucifer33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[6:57:30] <Techno> - grucifer33 just re-subscribed for 15 months! fl0mPog
[6:57:30] <naqqqqqq> yeyea i play CS and always have, val is TERRIBLE but i took a break and came back it just seemed like val was more prevalent
[6:57:31] <Morde24> Chinese numbers are separated from csgo numbers
[6:57:34] <huronvalley21> @Odrann liquid beat Na Vi
[6:57:38] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @SukksGaming yeah 2k hours in 5 years... that's not a huge monetary investment haha
[6:57:39] <mozkio2000> @leeon_ua vergin 😝😝
[6:57:42] <stormshitman> i dont mind the idea of backporting things to source 1 but  theres only so much you can do we just need more devs to do something cuz those few devs are putting in good work
[6:57:42] <TheOnlyWookie> Players are just not in NA
[6:57:43] <Lolsee> a milli player base lol. cs is never going to die
[6:57:46] <Odrann> huronvalley21 KEKWait
[6:57:47] <Ravager72> Why is stavn not playing chat? I've been out of the loop lately
[6:57:50] <marathon_fish> @fl0m do you know if riot gives advertising partners info on playership/viewership?
[6:57:50] <EINacho> tbh answering "no" to that question is only right when its a multiplayer only game that is literally dead with no community or its lol
[6:57:51] <f0ster_123> as someone who joined cs really late, I can say its never to late to join
[6:58:01] <leeon_ua> @mozkio2000 LUL
[6:58:06] <huronvalley21> yeah brother NA
[6:58:09] <sealxteam6> Alright all. Sking advice.     I have karambit black laminate and specialist mogul gloves, thinking of trading the karambit and my back up nocts gloves for butterfly black laminate.  Any thoughts?
[6:58:13] <iamnorobo> true words
[6:58:15] <apoodle10> cs is far from dead, if you wanna see a dead game that crashed and burned, look at KEKPOINT artifact
[6:58:15] <BeanosTV> I wasn't sure if taking a shit was worth it, but you have convinced me
[6:58:15] <Nightbot> Counter-Strike
[6:58:18] <C_Banshee> CSGO was the first pc game I seriously played, high school was easier with that to grind
[6:58:21] <TheOnlyWookie> how many of those are smurf accounts?
[6:58:27] <Odrann> huronvalley21 COPIUM consumption finally worked
[6:58:31] <bigb1058> I don't think the worth getting into is necessarily a bad question fl0m it's kind of like saying can a beginner have fun in a game that people have been practicing for years
[6:58:33] <BadWolf_bad> my cousins daughter said that she watching tv series to fit in

[6:59:51] <BSODslayer> Or just be a slow boomer like me and stick to only watching CS and just play exclusively indie games and ancient gems on emulators, clinging on to memories while pretending time doesn't flow faster and faster...

[7:00:05] <YellowFD> hi flom
[7:00:08] <XeeVzz> i actually was one of the people who started playing cs in the first quarantine of covid back in early 2020
[7:00:10] <Inversion101> idk why but I love these christmas themed bttv emotes so much KEKW
[7:00:13] <ninetyfivemonkeys> heroic doesnt know what to do here
[7:00:16] <Ravager72> Hey fl0m why is stavn not playing? I've been out of the loop lately and just tuned in
[7:00:22] <td_gg> for honor is a self hatred game
[7:00:23] <DashX239> the only other game I put hours into was like Overwatch in the first couple seasons
[7:00:24] <siDDziy> @shakemedaddy lol what
[7:00:26] <s1mply_ant> same here

[7:00:46] <Ravager72> ah ok thanks

[7:00:49] <leeon_ua> @fl0m what does Source 2 mean for CS:GO? I assume it's good, but I lack the technical knowledge to understand if it's going to improve anything and if it is needed in the first place.
[7:00:49] <siDDziy> I literally Discovered the whole csgo competitive scene last year lol
[7:00:52] <sealxteam6> I came back to cs after 1 year and ahalf and the scene is so much better lol
[7:00:53] <C_Banshee> I think valorant also brought over some people who got into shooters during covid
[7:00:55] <yourlocallurker12> what would you say is top 10 esports scenes for you
[7:00:56] <skon_cs> bro have u played this sick game csgo?
[7:00:58] <Treefi> They only get 9
[7:01:02] <5imon_has_swag> I think Valorant, has help CSGO as dumb as that sounds, the only reason I started really watching Pro CS is bcuz of Val
[7:01:03] <zahb> @raveheartgo have you had every flavor?
[7:01:07] <ealansari> do you think liquid can beat gambit fl0m?
[7:01:07] <iehdke> i started cs after playing valorant beta and consistently since then
[7:01:09] <del1shes> valorant numbers also dropped, hell every games numbers dropped compared to quarantine 2020
[7:01:10] <Dzoja2344> only time i quit cs for like a month was when r8 was added LUL
[7:01:11] <oTTV_BTW> hey you dont say that!
[7:01:11] <dankiyy> its ok to have bad opinions peepoGiggles

[7:02:08] <ninetyfivemonkeys> im glad i started on CS, i know i wont play it forever but i feel like its the best FPS to start on. gets you used to strategies and mechanical skill, and toxic mm players.
[7:02:10] <siDDziy> Galil vs famas
[7:02:11] <priiide_> i see b1t use the famas and think "i could do that" then i cant do that

[7:03:00] <gLH_TV> @fl0m what if Valve added 2 more maps to the map pool, instead of only changing the current one?

[7:03:02] <dankiyy> lemme fly on the pigeons again
[7:03:04] <peakzGG> Cache > Train
[7:03:05] <C_Banshee> Covid has been me downloading f2p games just to try new genres
[7:03:07] <bigb1058> They should put algae all over it like cache
[7:03:09] <DavieWhy> CHOO CHOO
[7:03:11] <Slasher> are we ever getting cache back
[7:03:12] <monkgamestv> more windows in bathrooms to A would be nice
[7:03:22] <Chezpuf> HUGE SMOKE
[7:03:23] <BSODslayer> @fl0m maybe a few tall cranes 'n' stuff around the horizon for faster lineups or something..?

[7:03:47] <Doccy> turn green and kill fps
[7:03:47] <jrmc247> I miss old cache
[7:03:47] <TheSolaceXD> cache is the most boring map, also it's green
[7:03:50] <fhilcollins> Give me a one way under a train with the m4 gg go next
[7:03:50] <salman_alik> dust 2 needs to go
[7:03:52] <DIkktudo> what about cobble?
[7:03:52] <javo_> they need to remove dust2 and add cache back again
[7:03:54] <mellerby604> I miss cobblestone
[7:03:55] <mynamesjohnnie> @fl0m did I miss all the other games before the final or were they not streamed   Cause I missed all the games somehow
[7:03:57] <leeon_ua> I want them to remaster Mirage
[7:03:58] <sealxteam6> cache remake worst remake in map history, change my mind
[7:03:59] <pigeontriumph> The truth is that the valve is only looking for money
[7:04:00] <stormshitman> fps was dogshit on cache
[7:04:01] <jamejacobs> going under the trains, I forgot about that KEKW
[7:04:02] <salman_alik> YES
[7:04:03] <bigb1058> I'm so tired of watching mirage
[7:04:03] <BuSheeZy> I playtested so many fun versions of cache and we ended up with the same map
[7:04:04] <oTTV_BTW> SOOOOOOOOOOO BAD
[7:04:04] <NebChilly> cache was such a good map i miss
[7:04:04] <fhilcollins> I demand Anubis
[7:04:07] <linoleumpro> doesnt volcanoe work for riot now?
[7:04:08] <TrvsF> do u think fmpone working on val hurt caches change of being put back in?
[7:04:11] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @mynamesjohnnie it isnt the final its the playoffs o.o
[7:04:11] <PattyRip> CTs get so much mid and b control now
[7:04:11] <dankiyy> id rather play de_dust than d2
[7:04:14] <Doccy> all we want is a remastered remastered mirage
[7:04:15] <Chezpuf> I don't think Valve will ever add a map they don't own to the active map pool (see cache)
[7:04:18] <iTysonator252> i wabt anubis back it was so fun
[7:04:20] <BooomerNinja> 108 dmg nade POGGIES
[7:04:21] <Milamie> i miss cache so much widepeepoSad
[7:04:22] <oTTV_BTW> anubis better then ancient
[7:04:22] <sebstaran_> Anubis would be such a good add
[7:04:23] <v1495> its too ct sided now
[7:04:24] <BuSheeZy> @linoleumpro yes and he had input on the cache remake
[7:04:28] <dypcy> they should add cobble and cache back
[7:04:32] <pinksoda> we want old cache back and anubis
[7:04:32] <philhelm77> MAD
[7:04:33] <bigb1058> when is mill coming back? fl0m
[7:04:33] <songokucsss> I hope they remove overpass honestly when did we have changes ot that shit
[7:04:33] <Milamie> -mirage -dust +cache +train
[7:04:33] <DIkktudo> cobble?
[7:04:35] <SpartanJack_> Cache mid is a bane of my existence, I actually cant play it
[7:04:35] <rushil_20> if you could remove 1 map from the  current pool which one would you @fl0m ??
[7:04:36] <ShmetRT66> @NebChilly in csgo yes, R6 has dogshit map remakes
[7:04:36] <Inversion101> What do you think about them making a set of 11 maps with only 7 in a competitive pool and they just rotate maps every 6 months or so?
[7:04:37] <Nightbot> Latest video: WTF is going on in this CS:GO Game!? - https://youtu.be/RdpKJJP8_ck
[7:04:37] <G3RONlMO> which map?
[7:04:37] <AgentCazzy> A noo map, who bis?
[7:04:39] <Madfish2021> I hate mirage man. If you don’t untick it in faceit premium there’s a 90% chance you’re playing it
[7:04:40] <gLH_TV> what if Valve added 2 more maps to the map pool, instead of only changing the current one?
[7:04:40] <DavieWhy> In casual its heavily Tsided lol
[7:04:41] <fhilcollins> Anubis and Cplfire 😁
[7:04:41] <billballbowl> I think they should design and release new maps, that would be cool :)
[7:04:41] <evili21> yeah fl0m how do you feel about bringing cobble back
[7:04:41] <s1mply_ant> soryy just missed, what map are we talking about?
[7:04:41] <stormshitman> @pinksoda cobble is very outdated
[7:04:41] <Synclarity> NODDERS
[7:04:43] <Ravager72> Which of the old maps would you want to have back in the pool, assuming they reworked it?
[7:04:44] <ninetyfivemonkeys> anubis is bad imo
[7:04:47] <AFugy> TouchSomeGrass
[7:04:47] <jakehascak3> ANUBIS
[7:04:48] <dypcy> @DIkktudo i mean the old cobble
[7:04:48] <jrmc247> agreed
[7:04:49] <BizarreMark> MmmHmm Cant wait for tuscan
[7:04:50] <linoleumpro> @BuSheeZy thought he was the one that was doing it
[7:04:50] <unh0Iyy> SOOOOOOO TRUUUUUU
[7:04:51] <elmar1760> is the map pool fixed for the whole year or hoe does the map pool in pro games work?
[7:04:52] <sealxteam6> we want old cache

[7:05:03] <Doccy> fl0m HATES casual players
[7:05:06] <Doccy> Madge
[7:05:11] <monkgamestv> casual is a different animal
[7:05:12] <salman_alik> cts spraying into b tunnel with m4a1s in dust 2
[7:05:14] <DavieWhy> Confirmed
[7:05:16] <marathon_fish> @fl0m how would you feel about valve separating the casual and pro map pools... would solve the problem of them not being able to remove d2 and mirage b/c they are so popular in casual
[7:05:16] <Shimshammie> #disagree
[7:05:17] <salman_alik> eww
[7:05:18] <fhilcollins> Tuscan needs to be ready yesterday
[7:05:19] <XJowzii> b doors change?

[7:05:30] <GroGriFF> dust2 feel great in gungame idk what youre all complaining about
[7:05:32] <doublexpwiikend> dust 2 change is the only good change dust 2 has ever had
[7:05:33] <shutthafoxup> The Dust2 changes are the reason you don't listen to Reddit for advice
[7:05:34] <cloud_zenn> @fl0m did you ever like de_season?
[7:05:37] <BuSheeZy> @linoleumpro fmpone and volcano made the original cs go cache and fmpone remade cache pretty much by himself with small input from volcano.
[7:05:50] <AFugy> BLUBBERS  BLUBBERS  BLUBBERS
[7:05:50] <jamejacobs> no it is not T sided on casual, your team wasn't good

[7:06:16] <BizarreMark> peepoW
[7:06:18] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @shutthafoxup yeah the people who complain on reddit are malding at a mm match they get slapped in on the regular
[7:06:18] <DIkktudo> its a skill map
[7:06:20] <dnillo> t pistol is literally impossible on  d2 fl0m half the time cts just rush mid and taking long is almost impossible with glocks
[7:06:20] <linoleumpro> @BuSheeZy oh ya i forgot fmpone created it too
[7:06:22] <Shcooba> bring back season
[7:06:23] <CapZ1414> de_tuscan please
[7:06:26] <SugarSkull4> any hats in the merch drop???
[7:06:27] <Ravager72> And if you lose any site the best option in 90% of rounds is just save KEKW
[7:06:27] <CapZ1414> or season
[7:06:28] <DavieWhy> So if they could nade doors from T spawn it'd be okay?

[7:06:33] <bigb1058> sealxteam6 caught in the cross fire ironically
[7:06:36] <random_factz> GoodTake btw
[7:06:37] <st4sisfield> do you think they should try and make de_season from source work?
[7:06:38] <G3RONlMO> If I ever saw Gambit on the street I'd run the other way - just so jacked
[7:06:39] <Tvjuli> Unpopular opinion: I liked being able to see CT´s crossing on spawn
[7:06:39] <sealxteam6> all good @Chezpuf  haha
[7:06:40] <fhilcollins> @mynamesjohnnie wtf this ain’t the place or the person for that
[7:06:44] <gLH_TV> what if Valve added 2 more maps to the map pool, instead of only changing the current one?

[11:03:51] <Firefawks> @dweevers Nice nice, Bard saw some meaty changes that bumped their single-target damage up by a fair bit this expansion, they are actually fairly competitively now compared to Shadowbringers.
[11:04:16] <dweevers> Firefawks yeah it's been a nice change

[11:06:07] <Firefawks> I like that they put the MP5SD into the game. I love the idea of a weapon being suppressed straight out of the gates.

[11:07:36] <haejeok> ahh unfortunate. prob cuz it's not marketed much yet
[11:07:47] <Doccy> i mean every br has bots
[11:08:01] <haejeok> is that really true tho
[11:08:09] <ezzi09> yeah its in beta
[11:08:17] <stlckbo> they are a non issue imo. they help to pop queues and dont kill you
[11:08:17] <Doccy> yeah they use them to fill out a handful of slots to make lobbies
[11:08:34] <Firefawks> @fl0m Not sure if you knew already, but if you ping a location and then pull out your little tablet, it shows your ping on the tablet's map. Makes teleporting/nuking a lot easier.
[11:08:37] <haejeok> this seems more like pubg than anything
[11:08:39] <haejeok> is that true
[11:08:39] <Doccy> yeah it is not a bad thing they exist

[11:28:33] <Doccy> they've noticed a few bots
[11:28:56] <Firefawks> @rapid3yemovement It varies based on region tbh. I get paired with the Asia server and the game is poppin' right now, I just think it needs more exposure in NA/EU

[11:39:08] <vek16_> game reminds me a TON of pubg
[11:39:09] <JimmyBarsNitro> Maybe a good idea
[11:39:45] <Firefawks> Minimum, tbh. Playing 1 game and calling it dogshit just isn't giving it a fair go. 3 decent length games is at least the minimum to get a feel for whether or not it's piqued your interest and if you'll play more of it.

[11:47:16] <TheAuditorTV> this a mobile game?
[11:47:27] <ghooulio> is this game fun?
[11:47:37] <Firefawks> @TheAuditorTV Nope
[11:47:40] <Firefawks> @ghooulio Yes
[11:47:44] <KodaRG> im so excited for merch Peepo
[11:47:48] <log1c0101> increase the fov
[11:47:53] <ghooulio> it just looks so complex and it looks like it has a steep learning curve man
[11:47:55] <Morde24> ELIGEFLASH
[11:47:58] <mynamesjohnnie> @ghooulio it’s super fun and I haven’t played it yet
[11:48:02] <Chezpuf> nah, cs player stuck at 90 fov
[11:48:06] <mynamesjohnnie> @fl0m no problem bro
[11:48:11] <LowRatedHighlander> pepegaFlash
[11:48:21] <Firefawks> @ghooulio Actually really simple. Consume pills for passive effects, you get one ability like an ultimate, everything else is just PUBG mechanics.
[11:48:47] <303matthew> Wait it's a battle royale???  I never woulda guessed based on the Title.... I seen you streaming this and thought AH must be a shitty indie game he was pauid to play

[11:49:04] <Chezpuf> wait fl0m go back I think I have that same dresser
[11:49:09] <Chezpuf> in the bedroom
[11:49:18] <mynamesjohnnie> @ghooulio I don’t think it’s that bad man like u pick stuff up and it lets u know if u can craft not it’s like the black ops battle royal wit crafting
[11:49:26] <theHovnival> @ghooulio but Fortnite is realistic

[11:49:56] <mynamesjohnnie> @ghooulio but that’s not giving it justice it’s it’s own beast its good
[11:49:59] <theHovnival> @ghooulio thehov3No
[11:50:04] <ghooulio> i feel like games like this r super campy and just looting for 80% of the time? is that in this game too?
[11:50:13] <gobbybraves> Thats fucking awesome. I love jumping on late and seeing the sub count crusshhhed for the day. I am sure it has been an epic day @fl0m
[11:50:13] <ghooulio> is tht a fair assumption?
[11:50:16] <siDDziy> !uptime
[11:50:16] <Nightbot> 11 hours 50 minutes 32 seconds
[11:50:35] <TheAuditorTV> are u sure its not a mobile game looks like pubg mobile to me
[11:50:38] <Firefawks> @ghooulio Camping is subverted due to abilities. There's a fair few characters that have abilities that can sniff players out.
[11:50:42] <Mentalstatemike> @ghooulio i feel like thats fair
[11:50:43] <Chezpuf> nope, different dresser
[11:50:47] <Firefawks> @TheAuditorTV ....Yes, we're sure.

[11:50:50] <siDDziy> this is a weird looking pubg
[11:51:08] <theHovnival> @firefawks I don't want that ability. I bet the players stink.
[11:51:15] <ghooulio> @ghooulio oh thts cool then, ill def try it out then soon
[11:51:24] <Firefawks> @theHovnival Fair.
[11:51:32] <Firefawks> LUL
[11:51:36] <theHovnival> @chezpuf unfortunate
[11:51:40] <Shotgun_Chef> That game seems like less looting simulator because of crafting
[11:51:55] <ghooulio> but can u slide in this game?
[11:51:59] <Chezpuf> hov Kissahomie

[11:53:20] <Firefawks> LUL
[11:53:27] <lavalamp5497> How many different classes are in the game
[11:53:31] <theHovnival> "Fucking dick in my ass." All of chat is hoping to be the one
[11:53:42] <Firefawks> @lavalamp5497 12
[11:53:45] <ghooulio> @theHovnival i just passed 4.7k after gambling 200k the other day Sadge
[11:53:59] <theHovnival> @ghooulio that's why you don't gamble. NODDERS
[11:54:03] <lavalamp5497> @firefawks damn thats pretty cool
[11:54:11] <lavalamp5497> I’ll have to check this game out
[11:54:20] <Zeyzo_> payOUT almost back to 1.1 mil

[11:54:57] <2020numbers> MmmHmm
[11:54:57] <salm0ntaco> yo does this game cost money
[11:55:04] <Firefawks> @lavalamp5497 Yeah well its free, so hell, what's to lose. The classes aren't ridiculously broken either, they are all pretty cool for their own reasons, but don't really do anything game-breaking.
[11:55:09] <Chezpuf> @salm0ntaco no
[11:55:34] <lavalamp5497> @firefawks that’s what I like to hear
[11:55:49] <nsbalkan> this game play got me bricked up on god
[11:56:04] <Firefawks> @lavalamp5497 Each character has their own mastery weapon too, meaning they get bonuses for using their signature weapon (Bottom right, next to fl0m's level).
[11:56:19] <ghooulio> hopefully this game isn't just the next hyperscape - that was such a fun game don't know y it died tbh
[11:56:28] <Firefawks> So it mixes up what you use, rather than there being "Meta weapons".
[11:56:32] <BonamantTV> what happened to sub chat on discord?
[11:56:38] <theHovnival> @ghooulio I've never even heard of that game
[11:56:41] <lavalamp5497> @firefawks oh damn I didn’t even notice
[11:56:42] <ghooulio> wat
[11:56:51] <theHovnival> @bonamanttv ...do I want to look.
[11:56:53] <theHovnival> ?

[11:56:58] <BonamantTV> Like i cant see it
[11:57:05] <Firefawks> @lavalamp5497 Yeah its why he has a WInchester in his second weapon slot right now, he'll do bonus damage and reload faster, etc with it.
[11:57:10] <theHovnival> Let me check
[11:57:13] <ghooulio> ubisoft hella promoted it, i swear fl0m was even sponsored to play it for a stream @theHovnival
[11:57:21] <HFS3> HFS3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! 4 months to 6 years of fun
[11:57:21] <Techno> - HFS3 just re-subscribed for 68 months! fl0mPog
[11:57:29] <theHovnival> @ghooulio imagine watching fl0m
[11:57:41] <theHovnival> oh wait. I might know what you're talking about
[11:57:42] <lavalamp5497> @firefawks sounds innovative, I’ve been looking for something new to play I’ve only been playing hunt showdown and cs for a while now
[11:57:48] <theHovnival> because I saw fl0m playing it
[11:57:57] <ghooulio> imagine watching fl0m @theHovnival
[11:58:04] <theHovnival> NODDERS
[11:58:21] <Justrollin> nice beard broseph
[11:58:26] <theHovnival> @bonamanttv I still see sub chat
[11:58:40] <ghooulio> wait fl0m do u rmbr hyperscape? hopefully this game doesn't turn into that - do uk y it died? @fl0m
[11:58:41] <esserb23> that jump seems like you would land and just get shot to death because you can't shoot right away no?
[11:58:41] <Firefawks> @lavalamp5497 Its what i'd consider a good game to take a break from the more serious, competitive games like CS or Hunt. Just something you can hop on with the boys and shoot some shit.
[11:58:43] <theHovnival> I didn't know fl0m could see my chat. Whoops.
[11:59:06] <lavalamp5497> @firefawks yea thanks for the explanations, definitely going to check it out

[11:59:16] <Firefawks> @esserb23 Its surprisingly hard to track someone that does that jump. From someone else's perspective, you basically disappear and reappear.

[11:59:25] <Morde24> KEKW thats ass

[11:59:38] <Justrollin> yeah.. shotguns are pretty garbo in this game
[11:59:39] <Firefawks> @fl0m Yeah shotguns need a buff in general.
