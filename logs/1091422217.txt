[0:49:08] <IamSoullessGinge> Hey Flom, nice cock
[0:49:12] <justiey> thats basically just a bo3 without a full 3rd game KEKW
[0:49:16] <joshiiwa> the idea is that the third map would be more intense
[0:49:19] <Cappo40> 2 maps. Best total over 60 rounds wins, if 30/30, go to regular OT rules
[0:49:21] <siri_t4nk> i have 100 euro worth of cases where can cash out ?
[0:49:37] <acetellmee> @SupraUK_ could I be banned for begging even though it’s not for a sub

[0:49:44] <Notech4u> when a baby
[0:49:46] <bluehipp0> drink
[0:49:46] <Justhoohaa> if the third map is always inferno it will still go 30 rounds so it doesn't matter

[1:11:21] <justiey> the juanteps
[1:11:22] <Mrjakdax> If you believe Pros don't tilt, look up Niko's mouz days and especially his face eyes roll back into his head
[1:11:25] <harshith_yellanki> silver medals for second place level of tilt ==== infinity
[1:11:30] <freddie_from_mercury> Just because they dont physically show tilt like apex malding it dont mean they dont tilt chat
[1:11:30] <bluehipp0> 1TAP
[1:11:34] <EggsEleven> obviously that kinda thing is a big part of being a pro. if you cant compete under pressure then you cant really compete and Im sure some really gifted players have failed over the years due to mental and Im sure some players have used their composure to carry them
[1:11:38] <BonamantTV> Mythic Pistol KEKWait
[1:11:39] <n0r13k> I know someone that can lipread french and she said that we don't want to know what Apex is saying KEKW

[1:32:26] <doc_blood> idk for me when I turned freesync on it limited csgo's fps to the monitor refresh rate which made it feel slugish

[1:34:04] <doc_blood> gsync is incredible for games where you dont hit monitor refresh rate

[1:34:35] <007deman> moth peepoIQ
[1:34:35] <SupraUK_> tbh fl0m your fps might be outside the gsync limits anyway
[1:34:38] <doc_blood> which looks and feels bad
[1:34:38] <freddie_from_mercury> im trying to make the cs apex allience started
[1:34:41] <SlickZkilleR> Apex with tearing is a HUGE problem
[1:34:42] <yobtih> Peepo idk tbh
[1:34:45] <hunter6925> he is right
[1:34:55] <jamejacobs> i bet next cs be like 1.6
[1:34:57] <SikhxStrike> during player breaks, is it that no practice happens either or just no tourneys?

[1:56:38] <0ldt1m3r> KEKW is this a silver match?
[1:56:40] <goldenlogic23> @SikhxStrike Depends on the organizer.
[1:56:42] <SlickZkilleR> @SikhxStrike I think only the grand finals was a b03
[1:56:47] <SlickZkilleR> err b05*
[1:57:02] <Notech4u> a late
[1:57:03] <0ldt1m3r> Only finals were BO5
[1:57:04] <SikhxStrike> but theres no standard for it?
[1:57:05] <goldenlogic23> @SlickZkilleR He said why some tourney’s do b03 finals instead of b05

[1:57:15] <stucko> @SlickZkilleR he was referring to the grand finals
[1:57:17] <D1srvpts> I think they should make it so only major finals are bo5 and normal tournies are bo3
[1:57:21] <kikovoid> NA CS AHAH
[1:57:23] <goldenlogic23> @SikhxStrike nope it’s like how b03 isn’t the standard yet.

[1:58:36] <otc_kaffy> @Notech4u Don't be so hard on yourself
[1:58:42] <goldenlogic23> @stucko well finals are what determines the best and part if being the best is endurance to play your best even after long hours.
[1:58:47] <pronpron> im smelling the 30 bomb
[1:58:49] <SlickZkilleR> @eyegirl most definately, but you could see from Nuke that they were just gone from a tac standpoint and were just waiting to get some easy picks and Navi wasnt having it
[1:58:51] <remraus> is flom on his alt account?
[1:59:04] <Notech4u> FIND ME coffee
[1:59:11] <Archit47> @remraus he has an alt modCheck
[1:59:19] <goldenlogic23> @stucko But ya b05 finals for non major events are a little overkill.

[1:59:44] <stucko> @goldenlogic23 yeah but a best of 5 could theoretically last 8 hours or more if it goes the distance, and forcing people to sit at a PC for that long trying to play a very cerebral game is just moronic
[1:59:46] <remraus> @remraus no awp skin i am just curious LOL
[1:59:55] <priiide_> the people i respect the most in these games are the ones who are willing to listen and try
[1:59:58] <Notech4u> i just hawkked up soooo much FLEEM
[2:00:05] <goldenlogic23> @stucko Yep that’s why I said for non major events xd.
[2:00:05] <priiide_> cause changes are theyre worse than fl0m
[2:00:08] <eyegirl> @slickzkiller OK NUKE THO fl0mKek simple was just straight tilted and whiffing a lot and it kinda made the game close. but again that's not really g2 doing good more like playing off mistakes fl0mHmm
[2:00:20] <Firefawks> Anyone else here ever had the issue where your game freezes but sound still works? I've been getting it ever since switching to an Ultrawide, for whatever reason.
[2:00:21] <goldenlogic23> @stucko like who wants to sit there watching blast for 8 hours straight.

[3:00:35] <DullaTPG> autumn_ltc the gamba is 30+ kills
[3:00:41] <inf1nityyyyyy> 69
[3:00:49] <2020numbers> @autumn_ltc pepeLaughing thats not even the gamba
[3:00:50] <yourducky> autumn_ltc KEKPOINT thats not even the gamble KEKPOINT
[3:00:53] <StormbornVal> %? 14
[3:00:54] <Nightbot> Joris says 28%
[3:00:55] <vis9ns> KEKPOINT
[3:01:02] <Talo0ol_150> why cant you watch the esl stream and cast over it why do they have to give you permission
[3:01:04] <gomDxx> dead game though
[3:01:08] <far0a> that also didnt include chinese viewers
[3:01:10] <megaganj> ded tho...
[3:01:12] <yobtih> and they won't let you get costreaming rights
[3:01:12] <Mountie888> dead game
[3:01:17] <yobtih> fuck them
[3:01:19] <yobtih> fuck esl
[3:01:19] <theHovnival> No matter how you cut it, it's good for @fl0m that shroud got to costream. Why shit on ESL for allowing a costream, just because your favorite streamer didn't?
[3:01:20] <yourducky> Talo0ol_150 because they own it KEKW
[3:01:22] <yobtih> and fuck carmac
[3:01:22] <TerranDan> because they own their broadcast rights
[3:01:23] <Neo1010> broke my hand cant play cs big sadge
[3:01:27] <michaisn> They said that major is gonna be first 4k stream, will twitch allow higher bitrate?

[3:01:40] <jibbadee> wait I thought IEM was a major? or is a masters different?
[3:01:40] <marathon_fish> @fl0m but what is the problem with that, ok so you don't get a ton of views but I don't see how that hurts them at all, like i get you're not bringing them a ton of viewers they only hurt their reputation in the community by denying costreaming

[3:03:33] <SupraUK_> @c0rkmcnortis use an ergo mouse and try reducing your mouse sens, the latter helped me with wrist pain
[3:03:36] <sivachandan> Do u think at this point of time in CS GO. Esports is what keeping the game alive

[3:05:58] <SlickZkilleR> @c0rkmcnortis put a compress on it, or get a wrist guard and stretch it out, it should help but to completely let it heal, you need to take a break frfr
[3:05:59] <MrDaFunk> I'd say the aim too chief
[3:05:59] <yobtih> Peepo im like s1mple but i suck
[3:06:00] <theHovnival> @yourducky aren't we all degens though?

[3:07:18] <jonimti> more rgb gives s1mple for HS% per click
[3:07:19] <phd125> he has more confidence?
[3:07:23] <michaisn> I belive that I can't clutch and I succeed in my believing
[3:07:25] <millah63> So s1mple's self assurance and over confidence allows him to convince others he's the best? I am sure his aim certainly helps with taht notion...

[3:08:49] <DullaTPG> venomaster2k4 monkaHmm
[3:08:52] <gomDxx> so you're saying s1mple doesn't have better aim than me Kappa
[3:08:52] <BoomingBusiness> KEKPOINT
[3:08:53] <SenorStinkfist> lots of pros have amazing aim, utilizing to its fullest especially in high stress situations, is where the mental comes in.
[3:09:00] <white_so_serious> honestly if Zywoo had the confidence of s1mple the difference would be smaller between them
[3:09:00] <bolottekid> OOOOBANG
[3:09:03] <Nanogines14> @fl0m after a level the difference between aim is very low
[3:09:03] <Nightbot> Latest video: CS:GO makes us ALL Wanna RAGE QUIT... - https://youtu.be/TSjsiaSPVG8
[3:09:06] <Raithorn> s1mple is so creative to watch, any gun in his hands and he finds a way to maximize impact
[3:09:10] <StormbornVal> Niko, electronic, etc have better raw aim i believe

[3:10:44] <far0a> the elige difference
[3:10:50] <atonesana> actually the confidence that s1mple has is the main factor of him shining , if any player like twisstz , elige , zywoo had this confidence they would all shine
[3:10:51] <Notech4u> then next spot
[3:10:54] <godflextv> eexplain tenz then ?
[3:10:55] <wiingnutty> Why don’t more pro cs players make content?
[3:10:55] <Notech4u> same approch
[3:10:56] <c0rkmcnortis> 90% of pro cs is just anticipating what's gonna happen, reacting to it raw is impossible
[3:10:57] <Maetthy> this guy's name xD
[3:11:04] <Nanogines14> at a level aim difference is very less
[3:11:08] <effxemm> ur pure physical eye to hand reaction is probably little above average - but the thought process on your adaptive behviour is above and beyond.

[3:39:56] <siiiif> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there.

The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Swisher gives Jonji a big drop.

[7:10:54] <Killer_Panda2k11> A follow up question, will the recovery be immediate or will it takes years to get back to what it was before covid?
[7:10:59] <Cian> and content creators can't compete if the org they're on has a team already
[7:11:14] <hobrev> yeah the tournament system is kinda fucked

[7:14:32] <strattoncs661> flom please criticise stews game play for the content 😂
[7:14:34] <Banan_Na_ButilkePt2> do you think G2 line up has long term perspectives? imo their top 3 won't last for a long time
[7:14:57] <JP1910> but why is there always so much drama in rp?
[7:14:58] <Copyntoothpaste> not wrong tbh, always a mess
[7:14:59] <theHovnival> @strattoncs661 No.
[7:15:08] <edlebert> why not save the awp?

[7:16:15] <dweevers> fl0m b1t seems to be more consistent than Flamie. I don't think he has the ceiling Flamie does, but the lows are not as bad
[7:16:15] <praeter15> how is b1t more consistent then flamie ever was
[7:16:25] <Beforenight> @fl0m good afternoon, you ever just have one of those games where you win and someone you still feel like your soul died a little lol
[7:16:25] <LowRatedHighlander> @thehovnival gengarQuake
[7:16:30] <rayy_20> B1t becomes the next Electronic when Electronic takes over IGL spot
[7:16:33] <Beforenight> somehow*
[7:16:41] <MyHughJazz> Why is purple muted?
[7:16:48] <Koai67> b1t has scream level hs %
[7:16:49] <SlickZkilleR> I think, if we let the rolling ball that is Boombla and Electronic do their thing, simple wouldnt need to try and cover and just do simple things
[7:16:51] <Banan_Na_ButilkePt2> what are your thoughts about G2 lineup? i think they wont be on top for a long time. maybe 2-3 months

[7:22:17] <Nightbot> Fl0m uses 936p as it provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown

[7:22:40] <51brav> !encoder
[7:22:40] <Nightbot> H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)

[8:21:59] <rme_irl> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there.

[10:33:35] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree
