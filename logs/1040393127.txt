[0:39:56] <RunningMelon> Seeing Val I always got the urge to reinstall it, but each time I do I tilt after 1 of my team has a mental breakdown mid game, another one leaves, one feeds and one flames while I sit there like: Yep, uninstalling again. NotLikeThis
[0:40:00] <floaty> once u learn the op sage walls
[0:40:02] <Descriibe> its more fun to play cypher when i dont have to play him every game roxiThink
[0:40:05] <floaty> u get free entries tbh

[0:40:31] <floaty> unless u wanna anchor bombsites

[0:40:38] <floaty> nah u should watch grim
[0:40:56] <floaty> u need to understand how the sage wall properly works

[0:48:49] <xjawzie> just stay in market nessa
[0:48:51] <iblatant> what do city in the UCL final and an egirls twitter bio have in common?

[1:42:28] <v0l1t> i dont actually like the valo skins i kinda like the soundeffects etc though
[1:42:30] <whoinvitedjez> stoppar i mig 20 p√• typ fem minuter
[1:42:39] <MRC9CS> are the skins expensive?
[1:42:47] <nomXxd> Why valorant?? NinjaGrumpy NinjaGrumpy
[1:42:52] <v0l1t> hevar but bvb wouldve won cl if we didnt get robbed by oil money redf

[1:43:10] <shay_lld> @MRC9CS no i think mx ist 40 euro
[1:43:11] <mglplk> MRC9CS not really cs skins are more expensive
[1:43:19] <shay_lld> yea
[1:43:20] <v0l1t> but you cant sell valo skins
[1:43:25] <shay_lld> no
[1:43:26] <Hevar> a dwagon? owo

[1:44:05] <v0l1t> lmao
[1:44:07] <MRC9CS> cool
[1:44:13] <kishimoto_fan> i will never understand the concept of buying skins
[1:44:27] <MRC9CS> we grind valorant soon?
[1:44:31] <v0l1t> as soon as you buy a 2nd skin for the same gun in valo youre just wasting money tbh
[1:44:47] <v0l1t> id be surprised if riot is making less money off skins than valve
[1:44:49] <RunningMelon> 50‚Ç¨ for a skin that you cant even sell :/ Like CSGO skins can be shittingly expensive but you can often get decent money back when you want to play another skin... :/
[1:44:53] <noujoss> what is ur rank

[1:48:52] <xjawzie> you don't get 150 hp
[1:48:59] <v0l1t> thats what i mean
[1:49:00] <xjawzie> you have armor that takes 66% of the dmg
[1:49:04] <v0l1t> full hp is 100 technically
[1:49:10] <v0l1t> but you get 50 from armor
