[2:24:55] <c0rkmcnortis> Hey guys, Had a tough day on CSGO. Four losses in a row because of toxic team mates, queued one last time and was happy to see that fl0m was on my team. With it being Vertigo, I was happy to have a good awper on my team - and having followed him for so many years it was gonna be great to play with him. When the game started he immediately disconnected, and we got pounded. Ended up abandoning after 7 rounds and I deranked. Is this normal?

[2:34:24] <imMaccc> This dude is so bad at Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I'm serious its unreal how slow his reaction times are. I mean he sees an enemy and then takes 4 min to line up the shot, another 5 min to contemplate whether or not who he is looking at is actually the enemy (50% chance he shoots a teammate or the ground), and finally a short 2 min peroid to contemplate the humanity of killing another human. That's just shooting someone mind you.

[2:41:37] <BooomerNinja> Honestly, spamming copypastas is the worst form of comedy to exist on this planet. Instead of original jokes, we just have repetitive trash. As a stand up comedian, I spend hours on my craft making sure I make original jokes. I always leave the comedy club with the hottest bros. Maybe you copypasta people can learn something from me.
