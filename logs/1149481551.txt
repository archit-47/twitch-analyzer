[0:30:30] <n0r13k> If anyone here knows anything about CSGO dedi servers, I'm currently running a bunch of docker containers that have several CSGO servers running via linuxgsm. Over the past 3/4 months the RAM usage on all of those instances have skyrocketed, with the the only common denominator being that I've updated all of them at the same time using a helper script. Anyone else having similar issues?

[0:35:44] <kSalty_> @n0r13k SMOrc degennnn my guess is something to do with your server itself. It it's using say 2x the memory it used to without any config or version changes, it has to be the machine you're running it on. Are you allocating like 8GB, then it used to use 3 or something but now uses 5-6?
