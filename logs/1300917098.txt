[0:47:53] <D_B_R20> I thought Dexter defending acoR on twitter was so wholesome!
[0:47:54] <Justhoohaa> just do a poll . I would rather just switch when vit mouz goes live
[0:47:55] <Morde24> they should pull a gambit, replace someone on mouz nxt with the veteran frozen, and switch rosters
[0:47:55] <Fillmeupbois> Would love to see more consistency from Dexter sometimes he looks out of his league and sometimes he's a master
[0:47:55] <JuhJesse> @vortrx7 me
[0:48:03] <Nisseboio> will someone be so kinda to explain how i put in an amount of points when the bet comes up? everytime it only lets me put in zero but put the vote
