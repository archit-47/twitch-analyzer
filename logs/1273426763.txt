[2:48:13] <apoodle_> mental health really isn't a topic for twitch chat or wikihow or something, but i'd say do take it seriously, and see it was something you can actively work on; 'mental health' encompasses a wide area of things, but whatever it is that bothers you, realize that there are things that can be done to make it better, be via a doctor or by yourself Hektic2
