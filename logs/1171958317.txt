[0:46:54] <The_Ganznoob> If I streamed I would lose money instead of even making income fl0m KEKWiggle
[0:46:55] <apoodle10> and like 50000 partners in total

[1:50:05] <WyldeG> its good
[1:50:07] <StormbornVal> easy to lose it in a fight lol
[1:50:07] <WyldeG> contrast
[1:50:10] <Jimkilledbob> they called the HVAC server.
[1:50:13] <gavincs_> its poop
[1:50:15] <Puddin_Wing> is it actually, i felt like i made up the n @Archit47
[1:50:16] <gavincs_> i dont like the croshair
[1:50:17] <boxxythegoat> i miss his box crosshair
[1:50:20] <praeter15> well i hope he finds it
[1:50:38] <Skinner18> at least its not 40 percent
[1:50:43] <acey_j> elige on 80% loss is still better than me
[1:50:46] <Archit47> you made up the w
[1:50:52] <Puddin_Wing> fair enough
[1:50:52] <gavincs_> @Jimkilledbob HVAC?
[1:50:54] <SorrowInRain> oh this match was crazy
[1:50:54] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[1:51:08] <mk_48> 1-2 percent loss is insanely high
[1:51:08] <Wankster2> Bro what is this dudes view model and res I love it
[1:51:14] <Kafkii> It sucks
[1:51:16] <Archit47> YEP
[1:51:17] <mk_48> because that is the average over a time window
[1:51:18] <WyldeG> did elige edited this himself?
[1:51:21] <StormbornVal> BO1 good, fun to watch
[1:51:23] <Puddin_Wing> i mean basing major qualification off bo1 is ass
[1:51:25] <mk_48> but loss usually comes in bursts
[1:51:25] <praeter15> im just waiting for top 8 because idk how any of this works anymore peepoSit
[1:51:27] <Doctor1597> i think the bo1s are going to make the major less competitive, and the tiebreaker system was dogbehind
[1:51:27] <Cake315> THE SYSTEM IS FLAWLESS
[1:51:30] <dotalegendery2> i like them
[1:51:30] <Archit47> its bad for the teams
[1:51:31] <Skinner18> it should be swiss instead of round robin
[1:51:31] <carboxylate1> not the biggest fan tbh
[1:51:34] <vchair23> dude just give me different tournament structures please , shit gets tired af
[1:51:36] <ConfusedTwitchViewer> cause it's all or nothing
[1:51:47] <dd2331d> What does this RMR thing mean @fl0m
[1:51:51] <sillio> it was a bit new. butnot always
[1:51:53] <sealer9> LAST MAJOR first round of groups was bo1s also
[1:51:53] <Cake315> its flawless you are just salty you are not in the major Keepo

[1:51:54] <curpyx> bo1 makes them all play with no mercy
[1:51:55] <Archit47> all or nothing on 1 map kinda sucks for teams
[1:52:06] <Doctor1597> @dd2331d Regional Major Rankings, each team gets points based on placement at RMR eligible events
[1:52:06] <fedoralva> With BO1 I just dont know how high or low I  ranking they are cause everyone plays each other
[1:52:09] <Cake315> %? fl0m will clap me
[1:52:10] <Doctor1597> check it out on Liquipedia
[1:52:10] <Nightbot> Joris says 5%
[1:52:16] <SICK0> all im saying is best of 3s cant start 10 pm eu time

[1:52:27] <praeter15> its a major pain in the ass to follow is what it is
[1:52:36] <dd2331d> @Doctor1597 Ah tyvm
[1:52:37] <Archit47> true praeter
[1:52:46] <Skinner18> BO1 are good but not in round robin
[1:52:46] <Kafkii> Is the only reason elige is showing this is because its against NA? Sadge
[1:52:50] <Nightbot> Latest video: How Practice in a CS:GO Team REALLY Works! - https://youtu.be/GHhpqhjTpf8
[1:52:51] <Doctor1597> the bo1 structure when there's like 30 teams per region is probably of benefit for speed but the tiebreakers are just 5Head
[1:53:01] <TenGee36> The tiebreakers is the only thing that needs fixed imo.. but overall im not a HUGE fan of this system, i  dont like teams getting punished for making changes, theres a ton of teams that are 1 good change from being able to compete for top 1 and this system basically doesnt allow it
[1:53:01] <k3ny0nn> i still think double elim is the way to go
[1:53:02] <praeter15> Kafkii what
[1:53:05] <Archit47> I still have no clue how the legends or challengers thing works
[1:53:09] <Kafkii> And you haven't exploited them for content?
[1:53:09] <praeter15> theyre playing an Aussie team Peepo
[1:53:10] <dotalegendery2> with more refinement it could work
[1:53:14] <Kafkii> this is why youre 139 paapoWeird
[1:53:16] <WyldeG> did he edits himself?
[1:53:16] <slb_> @Kafkii hes uploading all matches . its worth checking out his youtube
[1:53:16] <dotalegendery2> i enjoyed it alot
[1:53:22] <Puddin_Wing> because they don't mean anything anymore @Archit47
[1:53:23] <Doctor1597> id say if the match determines which of the two teams definitely makes the major, that should be bo.
[1:53:23] <Cake315> is it extrem-um or extre-mum?
[1:53:24] <Skinner18> Karrigan has similar videos. Even when they lose
[1:53:26] <Doctor1597> bo3*
[1:53:31] <praeter15> Cake315 extra mum
[1:53:32] <Puddin_Wing> when they introduced legends and challengers it actually made sense
[1:53:32] <Archit47> they don't KEKWait
[1:53:37] <Puddin_Wing> now they just call teams that and it doesnt mean anything
[1:53:38] <Dakota1KTV> @praeter15 ex 100Theives
[1:53:44] <acey_j> elige definitely has an editor, this would take too much time
[1:53:44] <Cake315> praeter15 alrighy
[1:53:48] <NateAlan> Haven’t been paying attention to the csgo scene in a while what team is stewie on now ?
[1:53:50] <Cake315> alrighty
[1:53:53] <Archit47> oh so there's no point in following it KEKPOINT
[1:53:53] <Kafkii> This is most likely and editor
[1:53:53] <praeter15> how did Nadeshot get 100 thieves
[1:53:59] <slb_> @NateAlan team liquid
[1:54:01] <Puddin_Wing> i mean its definitely an editor
[1:54:09] <Dakota1KTV> @praeter15 he founded it, no?
[1:54:15] <Kafkii> Why is extremum's logo so bad
[1:54:19] <NateAlan> Sheeesh he’s been on there for a while then
[1:54:21] <TheAuditorTV> KEKWait he only has 5 ping
[1:54:21] <ghost_from_above> nicee
[1:54:22] <praeter15> 100 thieves is a lot of thieves tho
[1:54:27] <Cake315> is grim the grim reaper or is he just grim all the time?
[1:54:28] <Kafkii> yeah 1up
[1:54:29] <curpyx> i hate preater
[1:54:38] <praeter15> i can barely get 2 and nadeshot found 100
[1:54:38] <retiiful> and i hate chat
[1:54:40] <WyldeG> mythic editor when? :)
[1:54:41] <mk_48> same @curpyx
[1:54:47] <Archit47> these comms are WAYTOODANK
[1:54:50] <retiiful> sick0 was mythics editor
[1:54:51] <Kafkii> fl0m makes up 100 thieves
[1:54:52] <AFugy> Godsent plays RMR and Advance finals this weekend
[1:54:55] <retiiful> but sick0 hates fl0m
[1:54:56] <dotalegendery2> i hope they could like schedule it so its not like 5 games at the same time in 3 streams LUL
[1:55:00] <praeter15> mk_48 didnt you get lost in a corn maze in Boston in 2003
[1:55:01] <curpyx> this map was insane because BnTent just started fucking going wild
[1:55:11] <TenGee36> ye if they change the tie breaker rules itd be a fine format... watching 3 teams face each other 3 times in a MR3 overtime rule set is weird and i dont think always allows for too much upset optional imo
[1:55:13] <TheAuditorTV> make up call?
[1:55:13] <Skinner18> I hope extremum make it to major over EG
[1:55:22] <mk_48> @praeter15 joke's on you, i have never even been on that continent
[1:55:28] <Cake315> fl0m never has such sick highlights because he never does something highlight worthy
[1:55:30] <NateAlan> What knife is he using @fl0m
[1:55:30] <zThrice> BIJAN FUCKING ROBINSON BABY WOOOOOOO
[1:55:38] <praeter15> mk_48 the annual Boston Corn Maze disagrees
[1:55:42] <Cake315> and with this im out
[1:55:49] <Dakota1KTV> @NateAlan nomad
[1:55:49] <mk_48> ok cant argue with that point
[1:56:02] <NateAlan> Ty
[1:56:02] <iVex> peepoSit
[1:56:03] <gavincs_> @TenGee36 peepoHug
[1:56:03] <Doctor1597> BnTeT is still absolutely terrifying
[1:56:06] <zThrice> Cake is an abusive boss
[1:56:07] <Cake315> %? fl0m never claps me
[1:56:07] <Nightbot> Joris says 20%
[1:56:08] <curpyx> fl0m stop wasting time so u dont have to solo either q so gavin and i can snipe or invite us peepoRiot
[1:56:20] <praeter15> if EG makes it then Tarik wont go to Valorant peepoSit
[1:56:23] <TenGee36> NO HIGHLIGHTS?!?! DO YOU NOT SEE THE BEARD?!?!!?
[1:56:26] <jokkerbo> if the singularity mind choses to learn how to do violence from ELIGE clips then we've already lost
[1:56:30] <gavincs_> you have a word from gavin tho :(
[1:56:35] <zeniithx1> i wanted extra salt stickers peepoSad
[1:56:35] <sealer9> lmao so true
[1:56:37] <Kafkii> IDK why extremum doesnt just compete in oceania either
[1:56:39] <Skinner18> Bntet best polish player deserves to make it to major. :D
[1:56:45] <Cake315> fl0m im working hard to burn every bridge i find
[1:56:46] <curpyx> do they prac and shit in NA
[1:56:49] <Archit47> BnB and ES disappoint Sadge
[1:56:52] <EddieVengeance> @fl0m i mean its kinda weaksauce if that is what they did
[1:56:52] <Doctor1597> valve really should clean up the RMR rules but I think they were made under the assumption there would be global LAN matches happening
[1:56:54] <curpyx> or did they just come to na for the quali LOL
[1:56:54] <Dakota1KTV> @praeter15 he's benched on their cs team
[1:56:59] <Kafkii> curpyx yes
[1:57:08] <EddieVengeance> if you are going to be in EU the entire time then you play EU qualifier
[1:57:09] <sealer9> the brazilian teams live in NA
[1:57:12] <dankiyy> could extremum have chosen to play eu rmr?
[1:57:24] <praeter15> wouldnt the Oceania regeion be easier for Extremum to qual Peepo
[1:57:25] <gavincs_> they came to NA for ez major spot adn still almost didnt make it KEKPOINT
[1:57:27] <sealer9> all the brazilian teams live in north america
[1:57:29] <dotalegendery2> @dankiyy  yes
[1:57:32] <WyldeG> is it because they want an easier opponent?
[1:57:34] <dotalegendery2> u can choose any rmr i think
[1:57:35] <WRXorcist> That’s bullshit & you know it @fl0m
[1:57:36] <Kafkii> Why was extremum even ALLOWED to go to NA
[1:57:53] <TenGee36> I think all regions should play in the own region.. i have no idea how they would do the spots but i think it would be nice to get a decent amount of rep from each region in the major
[1:57:55] <retiiful> @fl0m when are we going to finally get a new intro paapoWeird
[1:58:00] <dankiyy> dotalegendery2 i suppose, more so if they would lose all points or smth
[1:58:02] <Kafkii> None of them are NA, they live and compete in EU, all of their players are southeast asia area
[1:58:02] <STatisfacti0n> paapoWeird
[1:58:07] <TenGee36> even if its just top 2/3 from each region
[1:58:07] <retiiful> hi stat
[1:58:10] <EddieVengeance> i want a norwegian superteam with rain jkaem and hallzerk but that will never happen LUL
[1:58:11] <praeter15> the Aussies practice for the TI but they dont play DoTA peepoSit
[1:58:27] <Skinner18> @fl0m They couldnt play at EU rmr right? their points would reset
[1:58:40] <k3ny0nn> didn't 100 thieves inflate the fuck outta their salaries
[1:58:44] <valentin_vasilev> @fl0m i like the players who have being big games like nifty or naf is that dumb ??
[1:58:51] <praeter15> k3ny0nn 100T has a lot of money
[1:58:57] <EddieVengeance> @fl0m the RMR system is fucked all over i hate it
[1:59:00] <dankiyy> NODDERS
[1:59:06] <dankiyy> system is at fault
[1:59:09] <praeter15> dont most top Brasil teams live in na also
[1:59:09] <Kafkii> No way you can say nifty has big games, mofo doesnt play
[1:59:24] <acey_j> just because 100T has money doesn't mean they want to burn it on CS
[1:59:24] <retiiful> i see tucker
[1:59:27] <sealer9> godsent legit went from an eu team, lost all their major points.. went to NA and qualifed. wild lol
[1:59:32] <carboxylate1> hopefully eg just win so we dont have to be peepoAngy
[1:59:47] <WRXorcist> EG don’t deserve the spot cos they’ve been so inconsistent. We’re t they last at summit 8? Yeah, they should go to the major though
[1:59:53] <EddieVengeance> nifty is a weird one he just dissapeared
[1:59:54] <WyldeG> but in terms of  skills are extremum deserve a spot?

[2:00:12] <jokkerbo> meanwhile NAF has always played counter strike and just never blinked
