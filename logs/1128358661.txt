[3:15:29] <TenGee36> the skins would never transfer over honestly
[3:15:41] <itsWamb> true true I agree
[3:15:42] <TenGee36> theyd make more money forcing people to buy skins
[3:15:56] <itsWamb> I'd think they'd go down?
[3:16:01] <c0rkmcnortis> i doubt it, people will lose trust in skin market

[3:16:06] <guiltxoxo> @itsWamb yeah
[3:16:20] <guiltxoxo> everyone selling to get new game skins
[3:16:22] <Herabitix> theyll go down from panic selling and probably rise up eventually
[3:16:23] <TenGee36> they will just end up trading CSGO skins for CSGO 2 skins

[3:17:05] <guiltxoxo> the skins we have now are so good though
[3:17:08] <TenGee36> but either if people are selling skins to buy new skins or people are just opening cases.. Either way if valve makes a new CS they are making a billion in the first week

[3:18:58] <Herabitix> yeah but skinz = skillz saprolith
[3:18:59] <TenGee36> after playing cs enough you learn to expect nothing from valve, then youll be surprised when they do something rather than mad when nothing happens
[3:19:02] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @saprolith i thought skins = wins tho?
[3:19:04] <bvlgar92> what a cute dog, doest it bite ? :D
