[3:07:21] <cool_guy_168> i wish i got lost in that beard like fl0m got lost in my eyes
[3:07:25] <messyhair> STatisfacti0n this is true NODDERS
[3:07:25] <DullaTPG> ok fl0m can we bring the saturation just a teeny bit down
[3:07:27] <DullaTPG> looks too orange
[3:07:29] <dweevers> to be fair fl0m you moved to avoid long distance
[3:07:29] <Speedrulez> LuauLuau MmmHmm
[3:07:33] <LuauLuau> hi spud
[3:07:37] <Speedrulez> LuauLuau solid opening line
[3:07:45] <bluehipp0> @LuauLuau are missing pictures on milk cartons still a thing?
[3:07:46] <SukksGaming> @LuauLuau That milk is years overdue
[3:07:57] <LuauLuau> I think so
[3:08:04] <bolottekid> MmmHmm
[3:08:07] <LuauLuau> if I went missing milk companies would be worried
[3:08:09] <LuauLuau> love me some dairt
[3:08:11] <zmiIez> saturation is a bit off, Mirage looks a lot like Dust 2 right now peepoSit
[3:08:12] <LuauLuau> dairy
[3:08:25] <Speedrulez> MmmHmm typing is hard MmmHmm
[3:08:34] <DullaTPG> poll for saturation if its too high
[3:08:35] <bluehipp0> my milk went missing, do I make a random person "disappear" and stick a note on them to find it?
[3:08:36] <DullaTPG> peepoRiot
[3:08:38] <anklebuster69> eg going bonkers atm

[4:25:47] <wurmal> I mean substitutes propably sign up as a substitute because they are willing to play when they can, but maybe cannot commit to a full season, so they shouldnt be forced to rely on substitutes
