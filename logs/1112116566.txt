[2:16:46] <SuperTuscan888> KEKWait
[2:16:53] <bluehipp0> it means if you order 1/3 decaf, you get 1 shot decaf and 2 shot regular
[2:16:54] <RagingWalrus12> 2/3 caf
[2:16:57] <SuperTuscan888> nvm I'm an idiot, KEKPOINT
[2:16:59] <bluehipp0> I asked the barista at Starbucks

[8:35:26] <Doccy> i leave sponsored commands for a week or so
[8:35:31] <Doccy> cause money ya know
[8:35:31] <itz_shippy> it one shots leads and gives $50 per pop top path is what buffs towers
[8:35:48] <LowRatedHighlander> Doccy well the beta is open tomorrow so the drop stuff wont help anymore
[8:35:59] <a732v> Try the boomer!
[8:36:06] <LowRatedHighlander> its was all for drops that gave access to the beta early
[8:36:08] <a732v> bottom path boomer is good for moabs
[8:36:11] <Doccy> oh lol
[8:36:11] <itz_shippy> if you dont like using moab mauler then you can use top path plane instead
[8:36:18] <LowRatedHighlander> at least i think its open tomorrow
[8:36:22] <Doccy> i'll fix it up later

At Level 11+, he grants all Magic Monkeys nearby with +2 pierce and +5 range on top of any other buffs, in turn buffing Druids to +3 pierce instead of +2. At Level 18+, his final buff allows all Druids of Wrath to immediately start with full wrath for maximum attack speed.
