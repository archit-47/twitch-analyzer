[1:17:30] <Puddin_Wing> so like.. he didn't have to react at all because they cut before he responded

[1:38:31] <DavieWhy> Guys I come the future to spread the word.  The final will begin with 3 zeuses and 1 knife in the first 10 rounds.  But the most shocking thing is that in the middle of the 2nd map, fl0m is gonna go out for a poop but then the broadcast is gonna pan to the audience with GTR, fl0m, and Jojo parachuting in. They then reverse sweep Navi before fl0m bhops away yelling "Can I have 5 Gifted?"

[3:37:57] <Shotgun_Chef> @fl0m i think you are wrong about B05 being bad for the major final. if Navi speed runs this, it is gonna be like 2hrs and I think the major should be a bit more significant
[3:37:58] <f0rreverr> it's obviously 69 subs
[3:37:59] <SupraUK_> you don't need to trust me too much
[3:38:01] <zoba9k> holy
