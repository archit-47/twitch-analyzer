[0:56:55] <Justhoohaa> @madfish2021 he's good at the game. he just solo Q's and he finds mirage the easiest to play. if course he's better on mirage than any other map but he's not a bad player

[0:59:43] <FlameyKumori> My favorite thing about the scout is when you're tagging and getting kills with it then someone buys an AWP and tells you to get rid of your scout since they bought the AWP
[0:59:52] <KA1SR__> Mirage? More like bad! Am I right guys?!
[0:59:59] <Justhoohaa> @madfish2021 I guess I'm saying being bad is relative. he just doesn't understand the other maps as much. I'm not defending one map vetoes. I literally bought premium just to ban mirage inferno and d2 lol. I'm just saying that it doesn't make him a bad player

[1:30:21] <FiberZ_> ironman
[1:30:21] <joemozzie> shang chi was so good
[1:30:22] <sjoerdtheman> thor ragnarok or infinity war for sure
[1:30:22] <f1uffy25> iron man
[1:30:23] <lurei3107> nah dc better
[1:30:23] <kannar_tv> gelly_bellly POGGIES
[1:30:23] <zoofuu_> Is it on Disney plus?
[1:30:24] <automationfor> cause they are all actually the same movie fl0m ?>
[1:30:29] <twennyNumbers> speedr25L sjoerdtheman
[1:30:30] <rony9> I assumed Eternals was gonna suck... that's why I haven't watched it
[1:30:30] <Sealer9> they def needed to make that into a series not a movie @fl0m
[1:30:31] <damptowell> perfect action/comedy combo
[1:30:31] <gelly_bellly> best marvel movie is Captain America the Winter soldier
[1:30:32] <LowRatedHighlander> Dc movies are def not better
[1:30:32] <gilbilly> lotr
[1:30:33] <FourHornUnicorn> Original Iron man or Thor Rag
[1:30:34] <IntoXica7eD> Ragnarok was dope and a nice shift from the norm
[1:30:35] <GFYMeowMix> gonna watch eternals this weekend Sadge
[1:30:35] <LowRatedHighlander> Comics maybe
[1:30:36] <Justhoohaa> the Loki show to me is the best even though it's not a movie
[1:30:36] <ThatOtherGuy122> New spooder man
[1:30:36] <necr0g> my little pony is the best marvel character
[1:30:37] <sjoerdtheman> twennyNumbers peepoHug
[1:30:39] <LowRatedHighlander> Movies god no
[1:30:42] <twennyNumbers> peepoHuggers
[1:30:43] <erk12> ragnorak was fire
[1:30:45] <manning_mat> Dr. Strange was better than expected
[1:30:45] <Mr_Gatler> I'm literally just watching eternals and I'm 20 mins in and very bored, it got me here tho so it works out lmao
[1:30:45] <Sighlund> marvel fell off
[1:30:46] <bono_cs> that shape that u fly over looks like the mouz symbol
[1:30:47] <Justhoohaa> I love that show
[1:30:49] <Flyingpusy> what if was really good
[1:30:52] <rony9> Civil War will be my best
[1:30:53] <not_ian> the marvel movies that don't take themselves too seriously are always the best.
[1:30:54] <sjoerdtheman> Justhoohaa yeah, loki is great
[1:30:56] <erk12> Justhoohaa loki was really good
[1:30:59] <jakenjoi> I think that's fair, guardians felt good as a stand alone movie
[1:31:00] <lurei3107> are you team cap or iron man flom
[1:31:01] <Aaron_Nad> Rhagnarok i think is the best. But i love Thor as my favourite Marvel Character
[1:31:02] <LowRatedHighlander> Loki was so good
[1:31:03] <mooselampa> Sounds like x-men movies
[1:31:05] <Wirf> there were too many storylines to tell in eternals
[1:31:06] <necr0g> how's eternals?

[1:31:10] <rygaardhansen> Gonna give winter soldier a shout
[1:31:17] <erk12> spoderman was great
[1:31:18] <Junior_Math> The Ant Man movies are solid
[1:31:19] <13relentless> Honestly, Eternals was one of the best movies to introduce us to the broader spectrum of phase 4
[1:31:20] <dop3ysteeze> it had xmen vibes
[1:31:20] <gelly_bellly> captain marvel is good Kappa
[1:31:22] <ThatOtherGuy122> The new spooder man was great
[1:31:23] <furdahcs> everyone saying spiderman is 12
[1:31:24] <gelly_bellly> KEKW
[1:31:25] <arjunracing> what move are we talking about ?
[1:31:27] <MadTitan98> dr strange was good
[1:31:29] <arjunracing> movie*
[1:31:35] <lurei3107> batman is better tbh
[1:31:38] <furdahcs> spiderman is up there but its by no means the best
[1:31:42] <Justhoohaa> the acting and writing in Loki was just so good.
[1:31:43] <LowRatedHighlander> Let me just kill off any of the decent characters in this already boring movie
[1:31:48] <jibbadee> I liked it
[1:31:48] <Junior_Math> its fun
[1:31:51] <Cacemen> what did I do?
[1:31:53] <barnumbirr> hey fl0m, first time viewer. Is this FPL?
[1:31:53] <goldenlogic23> disney
[1:31:56] <jakenjoi> different question then,  if you could recommend someone to watch ONE MARVEL MOVIE, which do you recommend?
[1:31:57] <LowRatedHighlander> Loki was amazing
[1:31:59] <jibbadee> marvel is just bad currently
[1:32:00] <barnumbirr> MLADYge chat
[1:32:02] <LowRatedHighlander> And Spider-Man was amazing fl0m
[1:32:04] <erk12> nah furdahcs its just objectively better than most movies. I am also not bias even tho spoderman is my favorite

[1:32:30] <sjoerdtheman> i would reccomend iron-man to start
[1:32:32] <furdahcs> erk12 i think spiderman was fucking AMAZING but id say its like solid top 5

[1:32:50] <Junior_Math> KEKW
[1:32:51] <jakenjoi> Totally agree, that's the situation i find myself in, someone who has never seen any, and they want to know 1 to watch
[1:32:51] <Justhoohaa> first Thor movie was not enjoyable lol
[1:32:52] <furdahcs> Joker was a good one watch movie

[3:02:15] <BenieMcGee> yk i was wondering just didnt ask
[3:02:16] <Cacemen> fl0m is there a way to rebind the teleport keys to something other then 1 and 2?
[3:02:19] <STatisfacti0n> fl0m out here with 10" fingers
[3:02:24] <bluehipp0> j
[3:02:29] <LUXZJE> j
[3:02:29] <mooselampa> Why isnt your jump key bound to J ?
[3:02:29] <mukulhayaran> j
[3:02:30] <SoporificPanda> why are you making your character cum so many times by hitting the cum key (C) ?
[3:02:30] <necr0g> mukulhayaran he has addressed this before, he likes to keep his huge cock on the j key to jump
[3:02:32] <jaewer> what map
[3:02:33] <JohnLawMar> is c crouch?
[3:02:35] <cptlayz> and "c"?
[3:02:38] <p0ury> i also use j to jump. much easier
[3:02:42] <STatisfacti0n> crouch
[3:02:43] <JohnLawMar> or crtl
[3:02:45] <dweevers> davey GFYMeowMix no ESR or Tomi hurts
[3:02:47] <GFYMeowMix> @davey Prayge
[3:02:47] <mukulhayaran> @necr0g ohhh, makes sense
[3:02:47] <cptlayz> thx
[3:02:51] <endlesslogfile> c is cock, pretty sure
[3:02:52] <necr0g> his balls hang over the c key to crouch

[3:46:53] <AMutantCookie> I love the taste and spice of jalapeno but raw they kinda gross to me, the texture is kinda off
[3:46:54] <scoobs_cs> to me, raw jalapenos are infinitely spicier than pickled ones
[3:46:55] <magics1001> That looks great for lunch.
