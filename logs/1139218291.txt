[0:38:18] <goldenlogic23> After a good game in csgo, i added fl0m because he seemed like a cool guy. We got chatting, over the next couple of months we became good friends. Lots of banter, lots of great CS and most importantly true friendship. I invited him to my house for a csgo lan party. He said he was coming so i was looking forward to meeting him in real life. When he arrived at my house, he pushed me against the wall and started nibbling my ear. Turns out he was vegan. Don’t trust this guy.

[0:39:02] <Papa_Reesty> After a good game in csgo, i added fl0m because he seemed like a cool guy. We got chatting, over the next couple of months we became good friends. Lots of banter, lots of great CS and most importantly true friendship. I invited him to my house for a csgo lan party. He said he was coming so i was looking forward to meeting him in real life. When he arrived at my house, he pushed me against the wall and started nibbling my ear. Turns out he was vegan. Don’t trust this guy. KEKWiggle

[3:19:49] <LucidR9> renato_g14 you're kidding
[3:19:49] <Puddin_Wing> It's just a weird change from back when polen would've cut fl0m off half way through that explanation to tell him why what he actually did was ok @Chezpuf
[3:19:54] <LucidR9> Chezpuf why
[3:19:58] <Puddin_Wing> feels strange to hear them listen and be like "oh ok my bad"

[3:20:33] <Puddin_Wing> i mean
[3:20:35] <Puddin_Wing> yeah

[3:20:46] <Demonara> jacob_752 dont worry enemy team is T-sided COPIUM
[3:20:51] <Chezpuf> he was by no means a new kid on the team

[3:23:29] <Rennerr> @iNKuuuuuuuu Nice, i liked fadey when he was first around with bravado, interested to see these other guys i dont recognized play
[3:23:29] <jbarth> awww i have one
[3:23:31] <dt4nguyenx> hello guys
[3:23:33] <jbarth> thats sweet
[3:23:45] <ant1clickz> i dont get why people call mollys 1g.. i think 1g was around way before mollys were invented
[3:23:47] <Puddin_Wing> maybe? I remember rosters, not so much the years around them @BrotherJon
[3:23:49] <LucidR9> my pug is curled up at the end of my bed as we speak
[3:23:58] <LucidR9> @ant1clickz this is a troll right

[3:24:04] <jbarth> @LucidR9 nice!!!
[3:24:05] <BrotherJon> @Puddin_Wing I remember the witmer/dizzy etc teams when I first started watching
[3:24:09] <LucidR9> thanks smileW
[3:24:15] <ant1clickz> def not a troll 1g was a mirc channel in 1.6 days
[3:24:18] <Chezpuf> ant1clickz specifically dying to your own molly. look up the clip on youtube
[3:24:18] <iNKuuuuuuuu> @Rennerr Fadey had a lot of potential, super sad that he didn't stick around when they went to the US first time around
[3:24:22] <BrotherJon> and that was like 5 years ago
[3:24:36] <Puddin_Wing> Summit1g died to his own molly when he was subbing for pro team Splyce, since then it's been called a 1g @ant1clickz
[3:24:41] <LucidR9> 1g is a reference to the time summit1g killed himself in a molly to lose a round and therefore not win the map (train) and go on to lose the series
[3:24:41] <umaroreis> hi are the whole qualifiers today?
[3:24:44] <Puddin_Wing> it was a pretty embarrassing moment
[3:24:51] <adzno> sumMolly sumMolly sumMolly sumMolly
[3:24:54] <Puddin_Wing> like he died to his own molly after the other team was dead but before he could defuse
[3:24:56] <ant1clickz> ahh cause i dont think summit was apart of the 1g channel
[3:25:00] <Puddin_Wing> so it actually ended up costing them the game
[3:25:05] <ant1clickz> i get it though
[3:25:09] <Rennerr> @iNKuuuuuuuu yeah hopefully Fadey gets the chance to stay and compete like the current Extra Salt boys
[3:25:18] <iNKuuuuuuuu> @Rennerr to think that ZA has literally the smallest csgo community in the world and it still has players like that coming out of it is pretty nutty though
[3:25:19] <LucidR9> osee is cute
[3:25:30] <adzno> Fun fact Davey was on that team when it happened
[3:25:36] <Puddin_Wing> Splyce Davey
[3:25:43] <umaroreis> GODSENT will go 16-0 in advanced
[3:25:43] <LucidR9> the good ole days
[3:25:43] <beeeens> @LucidR9 That's a government conspiracy with a fabricated video clip made to smear Summit1G for speaking truth to power.
[3:25:51] <0verBoardCS> @LucidR9 i played him in a pug 3 days ago

[3:27:57] <iNKuuuuuuuu> was like 16-1 I think @Rennerr   To be fair, this lineup is worlds better than the '14 bvd lineup, but damn I can't see ATK competing against T1 teams just yet
[3:28:00] <LucidR9> he did say 1
[3:28:00] <Puddin_Wing> i know they play tomorrow too

[3:29:13] <Rennerr> @iNKuuuuuuuu definitely not if looking at how ES got recked when they went to EU and ATK would get stomped by ES more than likely, hopefully they can just grow and develop and make premier first. Extra Salt stickers would be amazing to have
[3:29:17] <Puddin_Wing> I mean, you can only beat what's in front of you. They've still been comming well and not fucking up stupid rounds @dasfuzion
