[4:35:28] <ShockWeasel> I got talked into it by a "friend" was bored by level 20
[4:35:30] <STatisfacti0n> new world was fun in the beginning but I'm worried for my GPU and yeah, game was really repetitive
[4:35:36] <STatisfacti0n> 3 button combat system
[4:35:40] <bhanucr7> unpacking speed depends on your cpu
[4:35:50] <curpyx> is this an MMO
