[3:15:32] <Nightbot> Mod was quite unreasonable to talk about NA CS scene. Seems just like another 14 year old on twitch who just wants everyone to type KEKW everytime.... If these are the types of mods (and consequently goes higher up in food chain and extends to fl0m), give me permaban and I won't even bother watching this stream ever again.
[3:15:32] <yobtih> Damn I didn’t get the call. I see how it is.
[3:15:34] <carguycarson> damn junior still has a furia jersey in his profile picture KEKW
[3:15:40] <DefinitelyMeh> fl0m is the money bag and the ideas guy, he cant also be the voice guy

[3:16:39] <STatisfacti0n> hitboy I heard their might be a conflict with KIA though. Mostly because NA CS is running on Hopium atm and is currently not a fine tuned machine like the KIA Optima
[3:16:39] <Raxiity> How do organizers address ping advantage in remote events? I imagine it matters a lot at this level

[4:37:52] <redmundocs> Monesy bought out by liquid when fallen leaves jajajaja
[4:37:53] <sloveCS> its ok extra salt tends to lose their map pick often after winning their opponents
[4:37:55] <SpennyDurp> jame time
[4:38:00] <awshuckz> this was MIBR's map choice right?
[4:38:00] <keetnawilson13> honestly extra salt are scarier on vertigo than overpass

[4:38:38] <TectonicAmmo> who just said Stew needs to be taken out??
[4:38:41] <itsPoZr> I’m not gonna lie @fl0m I miss waking up to your early morning streams KEKW

[4:38:53] <LucidR9> does the info have to be real? well if not it's actually a 100% rate that if extrasalt win their opponents map pick they lose the series
[4:38:54] <sloveCS> i was getting mad at them during blast qualifiers cause they kept winning the opponents picks and choking their own and i just wanted to go home

[4:39:17] <valois_cs> 32-8 mirage today monesy pog
[4:39:18] <drivel___> Dude this has been an amazing competitive and overall sick tourney. Gj @fl0m
[4:39:24] <yuhoe1> I always watched fl0m’s morning stream during my morning dump
[4:39:25] <keetnawilson13> yes but give him a year or two first, i don't think putting him in tier 1 rn is a good idea
[4:39:32] <dewbore_1> weplay is insane
[4:39:33] <dweevers> fl0m it looks like riot is setting up something similar in Valorant with regional leagues
[4:39:40] <redmundocs> So monesy will eventually get bought out by another team right?
[4:39:40] <Dodidor> two of the cph flames guys came through some school thing
[4:39:42] <two_drop> m0nesy has the best movement I’ve ever seen
[4:39:47] <daredev1ltv> 66k chat points! Getting closer to that 750k profile sign :D
[4:39:50] <doctordoctor_> monesy is actually insane and just a toxic as young simple
[4:40:10] <culess_> you think liquid or eg should pick up a NA academy team to compete in those tournaments
[4:40:18] <keetnawilson13> @daredev1ltv gamble it all on overpass pls
[4:40:18] <redmundocs> Some1 get that man in T1 CS
[4:40:20] <LucidR9> tends to be the way - not that I know he's toxic, but they expect people to be able to do the things they can do - takes age for them to understand that they have talent they need to understand other people dont have
[4:40:24] <STatisfacti0n> that was a mistake
[4:40:29] <Speedrulez> Sometimes i forget this is not a ESL-like product fl0m it looks very clean

[7:37:02] <b0t_papa> OOOO
[7:37:02] <tav09twitch> @speciality_ he might know any player if theyre on a 144hz setup u never know
[7:37:02] <l3ordon> @two_drop People like stradman or TJ Hunt, they just kinda buy and modify like JDM or Exotic cars and make videos about it
[7:37:06] <speciality_> brute forcing a 360hz panel doesn't mean there aren't other problems. its like console games advertising 4k but you don't see grass more than 10 feet in front of you
[7:37:07] <nootnewtnute> OMEGALUL
[7:37:09] <Doccy> the expectation from devs is around 144

[7:37:50] <nanerpus_> Every CSGO T has the last wish to yeet the bomb as far away as they can
[7:37:57] <CornFedBanana> is 360hz any good or not worth?
[7:38:01] <speciality_> you can find 144 1440p on bestbuy now for like $200 with proper sales for decent panels too
[7:38:02] <Doccy> but hardware isn't there for the large majority of games to be at a constant 360+
[7:38:04] <TTR3K> that was a clean shot by fang
[7:38:14] <STatisfacti0n> jesus are we up to 360 Hz monitors already?

[9:14:38] <Achapman18> YEP
[9:14:39] <keetnawilson13> extremum just sat there and didn't play in any tourneys, either the org was terribly mismanaged or the players scammed the org
