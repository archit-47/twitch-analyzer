[4:36:57] <LucidR9> a prem debut at molineux is truly a trial by fire tho the atmosphere there is crazy
[4:37:10] <Speedrulez> LucidR9 for a first game that is is more than fine
[4:37:18] <LucidR9> sancho looked shaaaaky
[4:37:34] <LucidR9> idk why his first start we do weird side swapping bullshit
[4:37:37] <Speedrulez> your whole attack was mediocre at best. especially the wingers
[4:37:43] <LucidR9> like every 5 mins james swapped with him
[4:37:45] <Speedrulez> fernandes had some nice passes
[4:37:49] <Speedrulez> but no good runs from the wingers
[4:38:12] <LucidR9> our midfield looked soooo uncomfortable being pressured
