[2:36:02] <Juamn7> oh ok i know about the one way window but didnt know molly help
[2:36:03] <RagingWalrus12> @Juamn7 they smoke at the beginning of the round so it messes it up and you can still peek
[2:36:11] <Uh_Kevin> Chat, lets be honest. The dude with the deep voice is probably the same size as JoJo.
[2:36:22] <Juamn7> oh so its counter to window smoke or?
[2:36:29] <LowRatedHighlander> @juamn7 the molly is the most common and easiest way to do it but it’s risky
[2:36:34] <gapplebaes> holy fuck my job makes me want to ram my cock into a electrical outlet
[2:36:35] <Uh_Kevin> @Juamn7 yes.
[2:36:38] <kbtroublemaker> you can also block the smoke if u manage to get to window first
[2:36:57] <k1bsTV> Does he know how to defuse?
[2:37:02] <LowRatedHighlander> @juamn7 if the molly is there and they smoke window the smoke pops early and creates a one way for the person in window

[3:11:38] <JekyllNdHyde> This game isn't dead at all. Yeah people are going to other stuff to try new things. CSGO doesn't need huge new game design features like Valorant/Rainbow Six to keep their player base. This formula works for 20 years and still will work. @fl0m

[3:46:01] <MisonS2> caffeine @Chezpuf
[3:46:08] <Qvingvi1> 0mg of nicotine is a recommended dose.... I get alot more than that
[3:46:21] <Chezpuf> I don't drink caffeine. Too many heart wobbles.
[3:46:23] <Dynamo_Dave> I think the issue with coffee caffeine amounts is that different beans can have very different amounts of caffeine depending on how they're grown
