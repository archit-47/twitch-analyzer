[2:12:33] <LowRatedHighlander> although step brothers might have come around the same time as memes
[2:12:34] <Doccy> yeah i agree feeny
[2:12:35] <LowRatedHighlander> i cant remember
[2:12:38] <Doccy> those were dark times
[2:12:45] <Flame_Fhoenix> if it was a glock fl0m wins that NODDERS
[2:12:46] <Puddin_Wing> step brothers was definitely later
[2:12:48] <Dynamo_Dave> would you like to go to the pants party?
[2:13:00] <LowRatedHighlander> its was def later but idk if it was the same time as memes
[2:13:02] <LowRatedHighlander> i think it was
[2:13:30] <Dynamo_Dave> @lowratedhighlander late 00s I think
[2:13:40] <LowRatedHighlander> def late 00s for sure.
[2:13:56] <Puddin_Wing> stepbrothers was 08, anchorman was 04
[2:13:58] <LowRatedHighlander> 2008
[2:14:03] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah
[2:14:06] <Puddin_Wing> and a lot happened in between those years as far as internet culture becoming a thing
[2:14:19] <LowRatedHighlander> i think memes started popping off around 2009 or so idk
[2:14:24] <LowRatedHighlander> is there a hard date for that
[2:14:38] <Pappy_Pud> before "memes" were demotivational posters
[2:14:56] <Dynamo_Dave> Yeah there were horses and a man on fire and I killed a guy with a trident.
[2:14:58] <prius_tv> tig ol bitties
[2:15:04] <Puddin_Wing> nah but you're in the right ballpark. Internet culture wasn't really a thing when I was in highschool, and i graduated in 07
[2:15:16] <LowRatedHighlander> well wikipedia says the sideways smiley face was started in 1982 and started memes so idk fl0mSlam
[2:15:17] <Puddin_Wing> like there was internet, but it wasn't like this yet
[2:15:20] <LowRatedHighlander> cause that def aint right
[2:15:47] <Pappy_Pud> rageface comics, longcat, homestar runner
[2:15:54] <Pappy_Pud> all that boomer shit
[2:15:55] <Puddin_Wing> homestar runner was the closest we had
[2:15:59] <Puddin_Wing> that and newgrounds
[2:16:02] <Puddin_Wing> and stuff like that
[2:16:04] <LowRatedHighlander> homestar runner was def close
[2:16:05] <Puddin_Wing> like there were memes
[2:16:06] <LowRatedHighlander> damnn
[2:16:07] <Flame_Fhoenix> fl0mSlam wikibedia is wrong all your base belong to me
[2:16:11] <Puddin_Wing> but it wasn't the big thing
[2:16:11] <LowRatedHighlander> albinoblacksheep
[2:16:17] <Puddin_Wing> yeah
[2:16:21] <Justhoohaa> homestar runnnnnerrrrrr
[2:16:25] <Puddin_Wing> strongbad emails
[2:16:27] <Dynamo_Dave> Rush B. They've done studies you know. Sixty percent of the time it works every time.
[2:16:34] <Puddin_Wing> and the gi joe dubs
[2:16:39] <Puddin_Wing> those were some of the first widely shared memes i remember
[2:16:41] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah but when do you say they became popular is the hard thing to figure out
[2:16:42] <Pappy_Pud> the juggernaut bitch
[2:16:43] <Nightbot> Latest video: Who wins the Silver vs Silver CS:GO Match of the Year?! (Game 3) - https://youtu.be/FudA7bNr9C0

[2:17:01] <LowRatedHighlander> porkchop sandwiches
[2:17:02] <Justhoohaa> i was partial to red vs blue. that was the pinnacle of internet to me
[2:17:11] <Pappy_Pud> i still laugh at the juggernaut because I'm mentally a child
[2:17:12] <LowRatedHighlander> damn
[2:17:19] <LowRatedHighlander> red vs blue was the shit
[2:17:20] <Puddin_Wing> roosterteeth built an entire media empire off of rvb @Justhoohaa
[2:17:31] <LowRatedHighlander> i was hardcore into machinima back then
[2:17:37] <Puddin_Wing> i remember when rvb was first a thing, the blood gulch chronicles and all that
[2:17:44] <Justhoohaa> same
[2:17:46] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah exactly
[2:17:53] <Valleyman2> @Puddin_Wing The blood gulch chronicles are incredible
[2:18:00] <Puddin_Wing> did you ever see the other video those guys did @Pappy_Pud
[2:18:03] <Puddin_Wing> the power rangers one
[2:18:05] <Puddin_Wing> because it's amazing too
[2:18:06] <LowRatedHighlander> its crazy how that whole company started from a couple halo short vids
[2:18:12] <Valleyman2> Feel like that spawned a whole genre of content

[2:23:22] <nickelslave> frag check pls
[2:23:30] <Puddin_Wing> that juggernaut video went mad viral though. like enough so that they wrote "im the juggernaut bitch" into the worst xmen movie ever made
[2:23:32] <Flame_Fhoenix> so most of that shit was good and i liked it. fl0mSlam im going to go watch more
[2:23:51] <Pappy_Pud> @puddin_wing that was literally the only redeeming part of that movie

[2:49:57] <jayess3> yea
[2:50:11] <AFugy> this is about training, not winning
[2:50:12] <Valleyman2> @Voidism_ I think they usually play teams from Advanced
[2:50:23] <LowRatedHighlander> Voidism_ theres a discord server full of all the teams that are looking for scrims and they play mostly 30 rounds if time permits
[2:50:25] <LowRatedHighlander> !scrim
[2:50:25] <Nightbot> LowRatedHighlander, Scrims are usually played a full 30 rounds for practice reasons. so thats why the score is weird.
