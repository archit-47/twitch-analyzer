[3:57:09] <natas_k> monkaHmm
[3:57:10] <peepers_official> nopeee
[3:57:10] <BadWolf_bad> yes
[3:57:10] <tommypilates12> it ain't bad with aimlock on
[3:57:13] <yourducky> %? it wins
[3:57:13] <WoodenBird> I did and got an ace in my first game with it
[3:57:13] <Nightbot> Joris says 74%
[3:57:14] <LukeryD> five seven is Pog
[3:57:15] <risingsun2198> Dullies or bust
[3:57:16] <yourducky> PauseFish
[3:57:17] <froux01> YEA
[3:57:18] <whatchu_kno> five seven is for bad players
[3:57:19] <iVex> That sounds better
[3:57:20] <JohnLawMar> I like the five seven
[3:57:22] <buny_evil> p250 ius better than both
[3:57:24] <SupraUK_> p250 🐐
[3:57:25] <Moobot> fl0m has partnered with IBUYPOWER for all of his PC needs! Check out their website here: https://ibp.gg/fl0m
[3:57:25] <WRXorcist> Just buy p250. Why waste $200?
[3:57:26] <yourducky> buy an r8
[3:57:27] <whatchu_kno> cz is for chads
[3:57:27] <Koi_CSGO_> people that think the CZ is better also think that the astralis era is still going on
[3:57:28] <yourducky> Peepo
[3:57:31] <SupraUK_> 5-7 is a waste of a flash
[3:57:33] <natas_k> NODDERS
[3:57:35] <ChesterNugget> there's not aimlock here, @tommypilates12 only Name Lock
[3:57:35] <iVex> p250 cheaper AND you actually aim with it
[3:57:36] <mumblethyname> just stick with the p250

[3:57:50] <Kurintoi> NODDERS
[3:57:54] <wreck_it_reek> R8 is the only pistol you need
[3:57:59] <SupraUK_> in pugs, p250 + 2 flashes > deagles too
[3:58:00] <billballbowl> five seven basically a slightly worse tec 9
[3:58:10] <risingsun2198> An un-silenced usp is just a lighter p-250.
[3:58:13] <SupraUK_> kek9 is good if you're on max loss bonus
[3:58:16] <mumblethyname> i say just play with nothing but dualies but its up to you

[4:00:49] <sebstaran_> :D
[4:00:50] <risingsun2198> @Pirawks If you believe its a p250 it acts like one. Plus, the enemy thinks its something other than a usp on pistol round.
