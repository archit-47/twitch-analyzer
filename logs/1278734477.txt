[6:09:59] <wallmanm> Pan fry 5 min a side then tent under foil to rest and finish cooking gg
[6:10:00] <marsquirrel> I love smoking chicken. only takes like 90 minutes
[6:10:00] <Scooby_Droo> Baking it usually makes it more juicy
[6:10:01] <beeemen> rotisserie or cut it up
[6:10:01] <hongkongphoo3y> Mayo is awesome to use in a marinade if you grill it with chicken—especially thighs
[6:10:03] <ButImLeTiredddd> No no no, you need to cover it with parchment paper. And it will still be juicy af in the oven
[6:10:04] <CyberSquare> you gotta cover it to keep it moist
[6:10:06] <herbstmeier> so cook it then ?

[6:10:10] <BSODslayer> It CAN be  good, but the odds are definitely against you, both skill and recipe-wise...
[6:10:13] <d0ughtyy> is nuke the only map that has been played today?
[6:10:14] <TipsyW> people dont baste their chicken when they bake it and it dries out

[6:10:23] <wreck_it_reek> medium rare chicken is the best
[6:10:23] <Shimshammie> If you can't roast a bird you need to practice more...its super easy and, perhaps, the best way to do it.

[6:35:14] <ScoutPack151> fl0mApproved
[6:35:20] <dbleday> NIP has pretty solid planning
[6:35:22] <f0rmie> nip is faster then big can handle
[6:35:25] <piboy417> Big seems really reactionary and passive but idk
[6:35:26] <ekstraLUV> i meant nip
[6:35:26] <animal_chin> big is so tactical so they are probably better on the T than CT
[6:35:28] <hobrev> hampus takes over on rounds
[6:35:29] <PneumaPuma> I hope Deve gets better soon
[6:35:29] <MortarFFE> I feel like BIG was the most inconsistent team of 2021
[6:35:30] <s1mply_AnT> Big has pretty good team synergy and they work together well
[6:35:40] <SupraUK_> chat we have a poll
[6:35:43] <SupraUK_> vote away
[6:35:46] <rh3torixal> I think individually the BIG players don't play CT nuke well but I don't know if that is NIP just being better as a team
[6:35:46] <SupraUK_> can't do both on that
[6:35:47] <BSODslayer> @f0rmie this^^^

[7:42:36] <NinjaOnGaanja> aleksib to coach the kid, that's it
[7:42:38] <GFYMeowMix> i personally like mctominay
[7:42:39] <BoomingBusiness> but he's playing 2 8s so you play Pogba
[7:42:39] <whimlive> did anyone else see the stickers change??
[7:42:43] <sAmCaRam> Why they play so many times today??
[7:42:43] <CortanaLXIX> if they walk out A there against dev1ce instead of es3tag they'd get rekt
[7:42:44] <NinjaOnGaanja> he's the best micromanager

[8:10:14] <LucidR9> you need more of a CF

[8:11:24] <s1mply_AnT> this phzy guy is crazy good
[8:11:25] <Admrial_Aokiji> and hampus plays alot like an entry fragger so he def feels more aggressive and more of a fragge

[8:41:00] <SpykerLOL> Lots of phisical pain will always / not imeadaltly affect the mental side. It will eventually though
[8:41:01] <Finnyyyyyyyy> IBS/crohns can get sparked by stress
[8:41:01] <WookiePotamus> @suprauk_ KEKW
[8:41:02] <bluehipp0> I found this: "Dev1ce reveals to Danish sports broadcaster TV 2 Sport that the effects of his stress-induced Irritable Bowel Syndrome – which he first opened up about in 2018 after missing the final months of competing in 2017 – still plague him after finishing “every single tournament” he plays in. While the Astralis star admits it is something he has now learnt to live with, he says it can cause him to throw up for up to 36 hours after competing as his adrenaline levels fall."

[8:41:11] <bruhandon46> Jackz is fucking
[8:41:11] <bloof5k> other way around can also be true, there's a chronic illness where if you get stressed it can cause your liver/gallbladder to over activate

[8:43:08] <Broulf> @baaaaat_ @fl0m are y'all going to do the same thing with Cooper
[8:43:08] <gyurcsanyviktor> finally feels like a team effort on g2
[8:43:10] <ZanoCS> A lot of times things like what Device has can flare up more with stress as well. If he had a mental health issue at end of last year, could have been the catalyst

[8:45:20] <micreation> @micreation ahh, thank you. so, even with the power on G2's side, NIP has the cohesion of having played together for a while, where G2, this is the first event with two new players?
[8:45:21] <whimlive> cs
[8:45:23] <SupraUK_> MLADY0
[8:45:23] <future_jason> so if G2 loses can we call them Liquid 2018 Part 2 NA

[8:45:38] <ninetyfivemonkeys> NERVg i think phzy is a really good stand in given the circumstances but until device steps away from cs officially, phzy will drop down to academy
