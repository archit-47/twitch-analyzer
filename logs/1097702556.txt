[8:51:50] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's in-game settings: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY?t=426 (it's timestamped) (changed to gap -2 ; fixedgap -4 respectively)
[8:51:51] <LowRatedHighlander> fl0m youre doing fine shes just rough to start and a completely different playstyle
[8:52:01] <Serocia> Like each segment of the wall
[8:52:06] <praeter15> yes
[8:52:06] <LowRatedHighlander> itll still damage the boss though
[8:52:10] <LowRatedHighlander> YEP
[8:52:24] <datkidaa> ROR2 is so dope. Love seeing @fl0m play this

[8:52:55] <praeter15> her R is really good but has really short range
[8:53:12] <mr_grumpy_> I just bought a bunch of GFUEL sachets, one tub and a shaker. Cheers for the 30% off Dude :D
[8:53:14] <praeter15> ye

[8:53:29] <Papa_Reesty> nice shirt dad POGDOG
[8:53:30] <praeter15> the lunar item purity is really good on her
[8:53:41] <Doccy> chat was saying attack speed and cooldown reduction is good
[8:53:54] <Serocia> Attack speed itself isn't too great, a few go a long way
[8:54:04] <Serocia> Since you're still stuck with your cooldown timer

[8:54:54] <LowRatedHighlander> just gotta work with your cooldowns and you basically learn artificer
[8:55:27] <tizydore> i never really liked artificer that much
[8:55:47] <LowRatedHighlander> shes not all that great but she can be fun if you get the right items
[8:56:04] <LowRatedHighlander> problem is other survivors can make a lot more items work in their favor thats all
[8:56:13] <tizydore> well tbf i think any class is a lot of fun if you get the right items
[8:56:30] <praeter15> all the characters have the same base run speed
[8:56:32] <Serocia> Well, with RoR the items play the game for you.
[8:56:40] <Serocia> Eventually.
[8:56:43] <tizydore> captain was my first love
[8:56:47] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah but some dont need specific ones to work and can rely more on the abilities early game
[8:56:58] <LowRatedHighlander> at a certain point survivor doesnt matter and its all items
[8:56:59] <tizydore> i just didnt like that i couldnt use the orbital strike in the void fields
[8:57:08] <LowRatedHighlander> F
[8:57:11] <tizydore> F
[8:57:11] <Doccy> !game Splitgate
[8:57:12] <Nightbot> @Doccy -> The stream game has been updated to: Splitgate
[8:57:12] <Serocia> That's my problem with cap'n too.
