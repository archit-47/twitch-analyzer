[0:36:34] <BH_Lithium> @Archit47 thats the definition of a beta. the actual use of the word beta is different esp in big game studios. They did fix a lot of shit but we still play the old version with stuff they know is bugged. Thats not playing a beta, thats giving us known bugs and build hype

[0:37:55] <Qvingvi1> what type of sauce do you hate?
[0:37:59] <BH_Lithium> @Puddin_Wing definition of a beta in software development is finding and fixing bugs, as opposed to an alpha where fundamental additions can be made
[0:38:08] <jockst3r> the open beta is now, thats how I played it
[0:38:12] <Archit47> BH_Lithium Game studios fix bugs during betas and improve the game that way so the definition stands

[0:38:17] <AMutantCookie> KEKPOINT
[0:38:17] <stewbug123> the open beta is right now
[0:38:19] <Puddin_Wing> aye but the fundamental definition of both is as greek letters @BH_Lithium

[1:15:11] <SupraUK_> @ImTarco power delivery on the 3090/3080Ti, especially EVGA and Gigabyte, turns out to be insufficient for the GPUs and new world is doing a good job exposing it

[1:15:44] <Uwotm08> @SupraUK_ Jayztwocents did a video yesterday, apparently power delivery is fine but power limitation isn't so the videocard overshoots its power target by a lot.
[1:15:55] <vrushabh12345> no one plays cs in my school god damit
[1:16:04] <chickenuggetz2> why play new world when u can solo queue pugs!

[2:22:55] <ImTarco> @el_chapo_jr13 I've found a lot of success in just accepting "Fuck me, I'm nervous right now, but that's okay" type of things. Like how Astralis' sports psych didn't tell people to stifle their tilting. Acknowledge it and feel it. Then let it pass.

[2:27:12] <DashX239> valorant stuff is so consistent and standardised there isn't much room for creativity
[2:27:14] <Rei_J4> @Kafkii Theres another?
[2:27:32] <yobtih> i like didn't like it but now that I gave it a chance, idk it's more fun to watch than i orginally thought
[2:27:55] <sm0gless> what happened to katie
[2:27:56] <bluehipp0> JoJo is always on all high peepoHigh
[2:28:02] <KPC51> it's just a very gimmick-filled game
[2:28:03] <andrewmedaTV> Valorant is not as fun to watch as CS but is fun to play
[2:28:18] <Kafkii> I wish I enjoyed more than 2 of valorant's maps

[6:23:17] <praeter15> This game is unplayable. In episode 149a of Spongebob, in season 7, we're treated to the incredibly important lore that Patrick Star is in possession of an innie belly button. Yet, in your so called "polished" video game, Patrick Star has an outie. As a Patrick Star main, is it not enough that we exist at the bottom of the tier list? As it stands, your game was clearly released in an unfinished state.

[6:37:49] <originalpirate> faze makes it into the major unless G2 places 8th. otherwise their in.
[6:38:19] <sealer9> g2 has to lose 2 more matches after this one for faze not to qualify

[7:51:40] <Nightbot> hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
[7:51:49] <LowRatedHighlander> and i thoroughly enjoy van halen
[7:51:54] <supra_nightmare> fl0mHeart fl0mHeart
[7:51:56] <Puddin_Wing> that song isnt van halen though
[7:52:00] <LowRatedHighlander> i know
[7:52:04] <LowRatedHighlander> but its old as well
[7:52:10] <jokkerbo> I have a picture of me standing on a corner in Winslow Arizona somewhere
[7:52:10] <LowRatedHighlander> made me think of it
[7:52:12] <AMutantCookie> The only thing I remember about Van Halen is the bowling for soup reference KEKW

[7:52:49] <originalpirate> fl0m sucks Peepo
[7:52:50] <LowRatedHighlander> although not as old
