[1:26:17] <sloveCS> we would've had to win 2 though we almost took the first one we threw
[1:26:31] <bluehipp0> @LowRatedHighlander I also think the fact that the AK's spray pattern is so much more extreme than the A1-s is a big factor, with the A4 it's less of a difference, but that's probably more relevant for silvers like me KEKW
[1:26:39] <LowRatedHighlander> sloveCS yeah that game was super close
[1:27:07] <LowRatedHighlander> bluehipp0 the a1 spray is def easier to learn so it plays a factor KEKW

[4:39:44] <Puddin_Wing> yeah I agree
[4:39:58] <Puddin_Wing> animating it removes a lot of restraints
