[0:54:47] <dark_abe> so you like the Vertigo now, is it complete? @fl0m
[0:54:49] <DopeFreshPeep> @SukksGaming Weird, the scent of CSGO to me is like a musty, dank, but overall decently pleasurable, sweaty smell of gamers peepoHigh
[0:55:02] <Uh_Kevin> @xpotet !mythicleague
[0:55:03] <STatisfacti0n> Well, I mean you can get Elo OR you can get elo from a STREAMER I mean honestly, the streamer elo is sweeter @fl0m
[0:55:15] <fl1pdof> peepoHigh @fl0m go to an aquarium next time you take edibles peepoHigh
[0:55:15] <Mune94> @xpotet I mean, kinda. If you play a lot and you wanna get serious you should go for ESEA, it's the only way to get into bigger tournaments and stuff, Faceit is still as good and you can play in Hubs wich are separate communities where usually ppl are chill and sort of know eachother. I onestly don't think it's worth the money, not for me, but if you wanna go seroius it could be. It's up to you if you wanna spend the money for the monthly sub

[3:54:27] <LucidR9> !sumerians
[3:54:27] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree
