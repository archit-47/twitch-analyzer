[1:08:06] <007deman> @madfish2021 You leave at 16 if u follow the lowest tier of education decided by a test at elementary school. If you score higher on the test you will be allowed to follow higher tier education, which is MANDATORY. The only way you leave at 16 is if you're not allowed to follow higher education or willingly pick the lowest tier

[1:12:03] <macbookfps> how long till next match
[1:12:07] <007deman> @madfish2021 No you don't understand. You go to elementary school for 8 years, after which it is mandatory to complete a second education, which only lasts 4 years if you're following the lowest tier. If you want to follow a higher education after finishing it you'll have to start all over again, meaning you'll be placed in a class with 12 year olds

[3:41:00] <notseth_fullsend> I agree ... have not played in a while .... bets Esport I have ever watched
[3:41:00] <oxbobby> i havent touched CS since grade 9 computer lab. Im through college now but watching comp is fun
[3:41:02] <PottsnPannz> CS is easily the most watchable esport, especially for people that dont play
[3:41:02] <Nightbot> Counter-Strike
[3:41:04] <bakktothefuture> i got into cs from watching it first
[3:41:04] <ragin_irishmann> I don’t play either

[3:41:12] <FestyPandaTv> Mill, Contra, Ruska, and Tuscan all need to come back
[3:41:15] <RogueBing> @fl0m Its hust so much fun to watch
[3:41:16] <SukksGaming> @fartyparty SC2 was a lot more popular back in 2012
[3:41:26] <1KERY> contra rework for csgo would be interesting
[3:41:27] <ghostaryan> same @TLer6199
[3:41:29] <zybren> its up there with LoL with how bad the new player experience is
[3:41:29] <Goosh3D> Yea. CS has somthing you can't find anywhere else
[3:41:30] <keelanmac> @fl0m there's just nothing to play for in CS, no grind that's worth anything
