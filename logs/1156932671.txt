[0:24:36] <Darra5> Would you play more MM if it was 128 tick?
[0:24:37] <peepofat852> what is fl0m waiting
[0:24:38] <autumn9_> did you get any fancy looking skin from new operation ?
[0:24:39] <yobtih> good one panda
[0:24:42] <herbn> its straight up impossible on 64
[0:24:43] <ImTarco> Just another thing for people to complain about.
[0:24:44] <21slappage> you can still hit a window smoke with 84tick i wonder if they would compromise

[0:24:57] <SoporificPanda> yobtih thanks FeelsOkayMan
[0:24:58] <ShrapTy> I dont understand why everyone is so stuck on the 128 tick issue

[0:24:59] <2020numbers> Clap @supertuscan888 Bedge
[0:25:01] <bigfani> @supertuscan888 what game peepoW also nice
[0:25:01] <SupraUK_> the key 128-tick benefit is that window smoke on mirage
[0:25:02] <BizarreMark> pepeBean all we need is a anticheat pepeBean
[0:25:04] <Furbo_tv> i think its fine the way it is honestly if you wanna mess around and have fun play mm if you wanna improve play faceit
[0:25:05] <2020numbers> speedr25L
[0:25:09] <neo_942> maybe the bigger issue is just aus servers then

[0:25:21] <Nightbot> Joris says 67%
[0:25:24] <Archit47> I need my nade lineups
[0:25:24] <SuperTuscan888> bigfani word game, kinda like scrabble but without the board
[0:25:26] <iizarian> i wouldn't mind having the smoke lineups be the same
[0:25:26] <Archit47> ffs
[0:25:29] <StormbornVal> @bluehipp0 KEKW
[0:25:30] <2020numbers> Oof @fricks_lozf Sadge
[0:25:30] <yobtih> i need love and affection but my mother hates me
[0:25:30] <Hotshottoast> The shorter matches will have a bigger impact on the casual base than 128 tick ever will
[0:25:31] <SoporificPanda> the only good thing about 128 would be you could throw smokes that you see in pro matches
[0:25:32] <Speedrulez> chat will i eat tonight peepoShy ?
[0:25:33] <SovietChill> the only real difference in grenades
[0:25:34] <dweevers> fl0m they need a stable 128 tick. Valorant is 128 tick but it is so unstable it goes under 64 tick sometimes
[0:25:36] <jonnypondwater> EXCUSES
[0:25:36] <mbie1sa> so you're saying I need 256 tick to gitgud
[0:25:37] <xeryph_> it provides consistency
[0:25:39] <bluehipp0> ticks carry deadly diseases though KEKWait
[0:25:39] <BinkyCS> the people clamoring for 128 tick probably already play faceit so whats the point?
[0:25:41] <killabeeztv> 128tick MM would prob get me to play the game again and grind up the actual ranks
[0:25:43] <V1ZzxX> smooth gameplay
[0:25:43] <SuperTuscan888> YEP spud pls eat Bedge
[0:25:43] <Archit47> consistency on higher ping fl0m
[0:25:44] <frednametken> some people just dont want to acept they are not good, im trash but im having fun
[0:25:46] <Doccy> i mean
[0:25:46] <ealansari> %? 67
[0:25:46] <Floofys> What's really funny is that even 64 tick is higher than most other games
[0:25:47] <Nightbot> Joris says 44%
[0:25:48] <Doccy> what they want
[0:25:48] <2020numbers> you can eat me anytime spud MmmHmm
[0:25:49] <ImTarco> The funny thing? Compared to other games and like br's on the market, 64 tick is godly.
[0:25:51] <peepofat852> @Speedrulez eat my ass
[0:25:51] <Speedrulez> SuperTuscan888 ill eat Bedge
[0:25:53] <bigfani> peepoW you could spell words for points? @supertuscan888
[0:25:53] <SepiDrunk> Spud ofc speedr25L
[0:25:54] <Archit47> high ping on 64 tick is straight ass
[0:25:55] <yobtih> if I can't complain about the game, what is there in the world?
[0:25:56] <day1e> all i want is to be able to copy pros smokes.. thats all i want to be added
[0:25:57] <AncientPistoll> As long as I can use the same nade lineups for all my games I don't care what the tickrate is
[0:25:57] <jonnypondwater> provides excuses. keep 64 lol
[0:25:58] <LowRatedHighlander> What we need is 69 tick servers on everything
[0:25:59] <Ravager72> do you think MM being 128-tick would harm faceit for example? @fl0m
[0:25:59] <SuperTuscan888> bigfani NODDERS
[0:26:00] <Doccy> is for there to not be 128 tick
[0:26:01] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> didnt put in queue on screen fl0m paapoWeird

[0:26:06] <Booooooolin> KEKW
[0:26:08] <theBaboda> It doesn't give them anything really. the only thing i think it will come out of is that the players who complain about 64 will start complain about something new or about how valve messed it up

[0:26:14] <SoporificPanda> he laughed KEKW
[0:26:14] <TheAngvil> don't everyone always cry about 128 having better accurate hitboxes? Personally I never noticed the difference between 128 and 64
[0:26:15] <NibletTide> so, make pros play on 64 tick :P
[0:26:15] <bigfani> LUL
[0:26:15] <2020numbers> MmmHmm

[0:26:23] <edenlock> you can do pro lineups on 64 tick, just aim up or down a little and you're good
[0:26:23] <jackhale> I think specifically Bhopping feels much better on 128 tick but CSGO generally has tried to limit bhopping so that does not matter

[0:28:00] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m When I play in a DM server which is 128 tick nd after that when I play MM, I feel a lot of difference in aim nd the game in kinda smooth too (nd I have a low spec pc)
[0:28:00] <SoporificPanda> the nade lineups are enough of a reason for 128 tick in mm IMO
[0:28:01] <DLaccy> Hi Jameson
[0:28:02] <ShrapTy> I think the bigger problem in MM is the matching system. I get extremely lopsided lobbies on a regular basis
[0:28:02] <mukulhayaran> as a dust2 casual only player, I don't care about tickrate

[0:28:16] <theBaboda> I don't think theres anything else really. nades is just the only thing. Personally have never really noticed hitboxs and movement doesn't change to much unless its bunnyhopping
[0:28:16] <Doccy> idk
