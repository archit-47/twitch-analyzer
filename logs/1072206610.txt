[2:05:42] <MenaceAKA> i think its time for it to come home
[2:05:55] <v0l1t> like theoretically menace
[2:05:57] <v0l1t> i would agree
[2:06:02] <v0l1t> but then i looked at twitter
[2:06:07] <satan_ondra> @Nessa omg very nice bayonet ruby SeemsGood
[2:06:13] <v0l1t> and at the england lineup
[2:06:21] <v0l1t> and now i really dont want it to come home
[2:06:28] <MenaceAKA> what?
[2:06:31] <dotalegendery2> why
[2:06:35] <dotalegendery2> whos playi volt
[2:06:36] <Xeaz> i mean as long as belgium doesnt win im happy widepeepoHappy
[2:06:38] <MenaceAKA> well in that case you theoretically disagree OMEGALUL
[2:06:39] <dotalegendery2> playing
[2:06:47] <MenaceAKA> if youre basing it on the lineup
[2:06:59] <MenaceAKA> but i like their lineup a lot barring a couple of shaky CBs
[2:07:10] <v0l1t> its just the fact that its 8 defensive players
[2:07:14] <v0l1t> not the players specifically
[2:07:27] <MenaceAKA> 8?
[2:07:29] <Iukecs> england CBs really arent shaky
[2:07:41] <Iukecs> surprisingly
[2:07:45] <MenaceAKA> yea sorry didnt mean shaky
[2:07:45] <Xeaz> bcus i dont want the golden generation to win anything LUL
[2:07:52] <Saannyx> lmao
[2:07:52] <owenn71> NotLikeThis
[2:07:57] <v0l1t> are you gonna tell me anyone of rice phillips shaw or trippier is not a defensive player
[2:08:00] <MenaceAKA> i meant to say they arent the most talented but theyre actually pretty cohesive and defend well
[2:08:00] <Iukecs> belgium arent eevn that good lmao
[2:08:15] <v0l1t> belgium are good enough if kdb isnt injured
[2:08:19] <VibsTV> Belgium are great
[2:08:28] <VibsTV> Prove me wrong
[2:08:29] <MenaceAKA> Belgium are overrated
[2:08:34] <Iukecs> meunier is fucking cat shit
[2:08:36] <VibsTV> And they will win the whole thing
[2:08:38] <Iukecs> massively overrated
[2:08:40] <MenaceAKA> and they'll lose to italy
[2:08:48] <Iukecs> the only reason they are number 1 in the world rankings is because they dont play friendlies
[2:08:48] <Leeo2406> belgium is being the most consistent team
[2:08:54] <v0l1t> meunier has been actually great this tournament

[2:08:59] <Iukecs> most consistent team???
[2:09:02] <Iukecs> theyve never won anything??
[2:09:08] <v0l1t> he just always turns up in a belgium shirt
[2:09:11] <Xeaz> exactly luke
[2:09:15] <Xeaz> consistent loosing 4Head
[2:09:16] <dotalegendery2> ye
[2:09:18] <Leeo2406> im talking about now
[2:09:32] <MenaceAKA> they also struggled against a team that brought in the 6th best goal scorer in the portuguese league instead of the top goal scorer
[2:09:38] <VibsTV> Yeah like those italian players have won alot, All the teams which actually won recently are gone . so ?
[2:09:51] <Iukecs> what???
[2:09:56] <v0l1t> tbf menace they struggled because their only able playmaker got assassinated
[2:10:03] <MenaceAKA> HAHAHA
[2:10:05] <MenaceAKA> ASSASSINATED
[2:10:07] <MenaceAKA> AHAHAHAHAHA
[2:10:08] <MenaceAKA> get me out
[2:10:11] <v0l1t> i am aware
[2:10:15] <v0l1t> lmao
[2:10:17] <Iukecs> italys team has stepped up massively in the last 2 years
[2:10:17] <MenaceAKA> it was a clean tackle
[2:10:24] <MenaceAKA> and no one can tell me other wise
[2:10:26] <Iukecs> thats why i think theyll win
[2:10:30] <kareemserry> MenaceAKA ?
[2:10:41] <kareemserry> are you talking about the tackle where he almost broke the guys knee?
[2:10:46] <v0l1t> if that was a clean tackle the swedish guy made a clean takle yesterday
[2:10:47] <Nightbot> Follow my instagram! https://www.instagram.com/vanessaahlstrom/
[2:10:54] <MenaceAKA> @kareemserry on KDB yes
[2:10:55] <v0l1t> cuz he hit ball first
[2:11:05] <MenaceAKA> what
[2:11:08] <kareemserry> oh nevermind I thought you were talking about swedens red card
[2:11:10] <MenaceAKA> you cant even compare those
[2:11:16] <v0l1t> well you cant
[2:11:21] <Xeaz> the swedens red card was not only a red card
[2:11:28] <Xeaz> it was 2 years ban from footboll pls :)
[2:11:28] <v0l1t> but hitting ball first doesnt equal no foul
[2:11:34] <Xeaz> at least from the swedish national team
[2:11:36] <v0l1t> that was what im saying
[2:11:38] <MenaceAKA> the swedens one was a career ender with how he challenged the ball
[2:11:39] <VibsTV> Italy faced a decent team in austria and almost fcked it up
[2:11:55] <v0l1t> tbf palinhas tackle couldnt easily torn kdbs acl
[2:12:01] <Xeaz> bcus his leg was fucking straight out
[2:12:04] <v0l1t> yes
[2:12:06] <kareemserry> ^'
[2:12:06] <Xeaz> going for the fucking knee
[2:12:09] <MenaceAKA> the swedish one was unlucky
[2:12:14] <v0l1t> yeah
[2:12:16] <Xeaz> no menace it wasnt
[2:12:21] <kareemserry> that was lucky
[2:12:23] <v0l1t> stupid and then unlucky
[2:12:25] <kareemserry> lucky he didn't break his leg off
[2:12:25] <MenaceAKA> palhinhas tackle he actually was playing the ball with a good idea of where KDB was
[2:12:26] <Xeaz> like i understand u guys think that
[2:12:34] <Xeaz> but for a player who does that all the team in his league
[2:12:39] <Xeaz> then its not "unlucky"
[2:12:43] <Xeaz> that is dangerous playing
[2:12:49] <Xeaz> change my mind :)
[2:12:58] <Xeaz> all the time *
[2:13:01] <MenaceAKA> i dont honestly think that he had malicious intent with clearing the ball like that
[2:13:05] <Iukecs> aight imma head out
[2:13:09] <Iukecs> gl
[2:13:11] <dotalegendery2> cya luke
[2:13:15] <dotalegendery2> hfhf <3
[2:13:15] <MenaceAKA> cya luke
[2:13:18] <kareemserry> cya luke
[2:13:24] <Xeaz> yes
[2:13:32] <Xeaz> but i was trying to go fast Pepega
[2:13:33] <v0l1t> well menace the only thing i was saying was if kdbs still on the pitch till the end belgium finishes one of those couinters and puts the game to bed
[2:14:01] <MenaceAKA> didnt he leave at like minute 60-70?
[2:14:07] <v0l1t> 46
[2:14:13] <MenaceAKA> KDB hadnt been threatening at that game at all anyway
[2:14:16] <v0l1t> right after the break
[2:14:47] <v0l1t> well yes
[2:14:48] <v0l1t> but
[2:14:50] <ToToRow> autmEz 69
[2:14:53] <v0l1t> he can play a counter
[2:15:00] <v0l1t> dries mertens apparently cant
[2:15:16] <MenaceAKA> schroedingers cat
[2:15:27] <MenaceAKA> or however you say it
[2:15:34] <MenaceAKA> write it*
[2:15:43] <v0l1t> well
[2:15:46] <v0l1t> then
[2:15:50] <aisleOFcookies> sci
[2:15:53] <v0l1t> its only belgium won
[2:15:55] <v0l1t> no ifs and buts
[2:16:02] <v0l1t> i can live with that LUL
[2:16:06] <dreamyTraveler> damn those gloves tho
[2:16:26] <MenaceAKA> well yea im not disputing the outcome of the game
[2:16:30] <MenaceAKA> im just saying that they struggled
[2:16:35] <v0l1t> ofc they did
[2:16:40] <v0l1t> portugal is a good team
[2:16:51] <v0l1t> and the game looked ropey because the ref had a mare
[2:16:53] <v0l1t> for both sides
[2:17:07] <kareemserry> its wild that portugal france and germany are out
[2:17:20] <dotalegendery2> and czech is in
[2:17:31] <MenaceAKA> better to be consistently impartial and bad than consistently good and one sided
[2:17:38] <dreamyTraveler> the gloves are really nice
[2:17:47] <PopsicleSticksssssssssss> lmao that guy really annoying
[2:17:55] <Saannyx> They’re all useless
[2:17:55] <v0l1t> france to arrogant, portugal made a few mistakes and got a strong opponent, and germany lost a 45-55 game
[2:17:59] <MenaceAKA> @kareemserry im surprised portugal made it the round of 16 with how bad they have been managed
[2:17:59] <v0l1t> *too
[2:18:05] <Saannyx> just mute them and play
[2:18:09] <Saannyx> :)
[2:18:10] <v0l1t> yeah menace but he just didnt have the game under control
[2:18:18] <MenaceAKA> just?
[2:18:23] <Kalzone1> vanessaHi <3 roxiBlush hello everyone! hi hope you're all having a wonderful day
[2:18:24] <MenaceAKA> he hasnt had any game under control
[2:18:30] <dotalegendery2> kalzone <3
[2:18:32] <MenaceAKA> Fernando Santos is an atrocious manager
[2:18:36] <MenaceAKA> god awful
[2:18:41] <Kalzone1> @dotalegendery2 vanessaHi <3 roxiBlush
[2:18:43] <Saannyx> U too kalzone PrideUwu
[2:18:46] <v0l1t> youre talkign to someone who has löw meance
[2:18:48] <MenaceAKA> just as bad as Dechamps and Low if not worse
[2:18:50] <Xeaz> sweden in WC 1/4 sweden in Euros 1/8 :)
[2:18:50] <v0l1t> or 50% has löw
[2:18:58] <Kalzone1> @saannyx thanks roxiBlush
[2:19:06] <MenaceAKA> at least low put in a strong starting 11 against england
[2:19:11] <MenaceAKA> and then proceeded to throw it all away
[2:19:24] <v0l1t> yeah i actually dont think löw was that bad
[2:19:33] <v0l1t> in the end we had same amount of chances as england
[2:19:35] <MenaceAKA> Fernando Santos cant fucking come up with a strong starting 11 to save his life
[2:19:36] <Kalzone1> is it profitable for grabs still? roxiThink what kind of question was that?
[2:19:43] <MenaceAKA> i hope he gets fired and fast
[2:19:47] <v0l1t> lmao
[2:19:49] <MenaceAKA> i agree @Nessa
