[3:34:27] <Gmon13> thats cool they had the colours of each console on their frames
[3:34:28] <4phr0d1s1ac> @wallstreetbtfo i played a lot of warframe, people usually stop playing after a month or two after a big update but they always return when new stuff comes out, also this even is once a year

[4:37:45] <Sponknutt> I waited for years for them to make cross saves but gave up :D started over from scratch on PC, hit MR30 and right after they announce cross saves aha
[4:37:54] <amba_nation> my favorite is nekros :)
[4:37:55] <Puddin_Wing> In my experience, it's confusing as fuck for new players. There's a LOT @juster_is
[4:37:57] <Puddin_Wing> but i mean it's playable
[4:38:09] <juster_is> @Puddin_Wing Yeah seems like a lot
[4:38:10] <matt6888> hey you just accepted my friend request whats up man. HuskyBrigader
[4:38:12] <Puddin_Wing> and it's a good game
[4:38:14] <Puddin_Wing> it's just a lot
[4:38:14] <iVex> Wait what your Nidus is rank 0?
[4:38:14] <Bottsy> I just claimed Loki Prime! Thanks for the Drops @fl0m
[4:38:23] <mas401> ivara is best on stealth unless you build the 300 percent strength for the 10M damage build
[4:38:28] <DLaccy> Valkyr needs a rework
[4:39:08] <Sponknutt> silence on valkyr is nice
[4:39:26] <Puddin_Wing> To their credit, you don't really seem to hit a wall as a new player due to not knowing what you're doing, which is a risk when you have this complex a game @juster_is
[4:39:29] <Sponknutt> but for sure some frames need a rework, valkyr and nyx to name a couple
[4:39:34] <Puddin_Wing> like you can be pretty clueless and still have a lot of play
[4:39:43] <Puddin_Wing> so hopefully you figure it out along the way
[4:39:45] <juster_is> Haha cool
[4:39:50] <mas401> valkyr was my favourite due to the strength and duration build with her augment its absolutely amazing

[4:41:37] <Puddin_Wing> idk what happened but it seems like fl0m did something dumb and that's always funny

[4:57:43] <Sponknutt> I've been waiting for nidus prime for so long - him and saryn are so good with their ability synergy
[4:57:43] <MalATete> 10k plat????
[4:57:50] <yunix_s5> @djues333 ohh really
[4:57:56] <djues333> ye
[4:58:07] <yunix_s5> damn this game has grown so much
[4:58:11] <chrome_axes> nidus was my favorite for a while. the one i played the most is probably rhino or loki
[4:58:17] <yunix_s5> i should give it a try again but idk how much behind i am
[4:58:24] <Relentless1113> prime frames are better than standard frames right?
[4:58:32] <ShadowSytherZX> @Relentless1113 yep
[4:58:32] <f4ncycs> yes primes are better
[4:58:42] <Relentless1113> sweet
[4:58:50] <ShadowSytherZX> still waiting on new update on new war
[4:58:57] <chrome_axes> @Relentless1113 the best thing about beeing behind in warframe is that there is content to play
[4:59:01] <yunix_s5> it was THE BEST free to play b4 i hope they are keeping it that way
[4:59:08] <Doccy> i mean this game is basically a rip off anthem now
[4:59:32] <Relentless1113> I think I currently have 2 frames, at least I did when I stopped like 4 years ago
[4:59:37] <chrome_axes> those are fun
[4:59:40] <f4ncycs> this game was out before anthem though wasn't
[4:59:42] <Gonepunk> Warframe ripped of Anthem - confirmed here
[4:59:53] <ShadowSytherZX> @Gonepunk imagine trying to rip off anthem
[4:59:54] <Bottsy> POGGERS

[5:00:23] <ShadowSytherZX> @darksoul14789 yep
[5:00:29] <chrome_axes> favorite thing to do in warframe is max range loki disarm
[5:00:34] <f4ncycs> @Doccy other way warframe came out in 2013
