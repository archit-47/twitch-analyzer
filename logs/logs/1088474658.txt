[0:44:06] <keegle1> It does
[0:44:09] <SupraUK_> they can still be recovered
[0:44:15] <zahb> They can be recovered
[0:44:16] <DullaTPG> but you have to open it to wipe it, unless theres a way i dont know about
[0:44:19] <Whisken> Delete from Partition, Windows reset function sucks
[0:44:20] <SepiDrunk> the BIOS must have an ssd secure erase utility @fl0m
[0:44:22] <SupraUK_> you'll need to wipe, fill with junk data, then wipe again
[0:44:26] <SupraUK_> and that will take a while
[0:44:26] <Justhoohaa> burn them with a torch and they wont be readable fl0m

[0:45:56] <idiosyncraticthought> Wiping just tells computers that there's nothing there. Anyone with some skill can recover the data. You need to use a program that will randomize all the ones and zeros on the drive.

[2:47:34] <c0rkmcnortis> As someone who uses 8200 dpi on mouse and high sensitivity in source games, it doesn't teleport like that. Even with the 60fps frame skip of the video you would see at least 2-3 frames on that flick. There are 3 clear factors and you're doing mental gymnastics trying to find excuses for every single one of them.

[2:51:17] <whitechocolate64> Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.

Even if you juice you’ll only make gains if your body reacts well to the testosterone. Some people take very little and become monsters, others take every fucking steroid in the book and barely look like they lift
[6:10:41] <sloveCS> you have been a little insufferable the last 24hr
