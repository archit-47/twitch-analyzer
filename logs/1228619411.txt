[1:13:03] <andrewmedaTV> @dankiyy yeah i used to sell phones at AT&T and even my coworkers would tell people that and i'm just like WTFF
[1:13:04] <SoporificPanda> elo is a man made construct
[1:13:11] <Destructoid5858> AT&T tried to cuck me into buying a locked phone from them. Their system was trying to push that my phone doesn't work with 4g and since they are ending 3g they sent me a shitty 8gb storage phone that's already dead and told me that I'd need to pay for something better
[1:13:16] <greenteasake> I reported him, he's part of Mythic League, just bad sportsmanship period

[1:13:57] <waferthinmint> its not like streetfighter where the only variable is ping, there are enough inconsistencies where small adjustments to elo arent representative of skill

[1:15:22] <Moobot> Please ask a mod before posting links. (@davidkoo00) (warning)
[1:15:32] <greenteasake> If this doesn't really matter much but just for elo, its even more for a reason for him to not be stream sniping, not trying to justify stream sniping but thats just troll sportsmanship
[1:15:41] <SoporificPanda> peakzGG only exception would be ads that are run directly in the stream (like ESL does between matches and at breaks as part of the broadcast)
[1:15:57] <dankiyy> galil op OOOO
[1:16:02] <andrewmedaTV> @Destructoid5858 stupid AT&T. I will say having worked there before their system isn't smart enough to auto update the IMEI of a new device if you sim swap. You have to manually update or else they'll think you're still on an old phone. They are pretty dumb KEKW
