[1:48:23] <josome16> @gkaayy I mean I agree but they should have a chance to learn and improve
[1:48:24] <LowRatedHighlander> it was a miscommunication. someone spectating could have called no kit. then no one would have made the call in the first place.

[1:51:41] <fedoralva> "Let's be more aware next time that no one else is around"
[1:51:45] <fazren> the call was not needed, you making that call confuses your teammate

[1:51:54] <froux01> @molotovxcrypt "Let the guy with the kit defuse!" But no-one had a kit.
[1:51:59] <YUGNOVY> it was just a little confusion
[1:52:00] <vek16_> making my heart warm when fl0m is making situation better

[1:53:33] <bigb1058> prius_tv I agree I'm saying chat got used to the players having been ex pros
[1:53:34] <Tank_Melts> I was about to say mythic is not full of pro players or recent retired pros correct chat ?
[1:53:42] <hWhipCream> He shouldn't take it personal, life is full of these situations...Damn, need to learn to deal with criticism ASAP or life be HARD
[1:53:57] <prius_tv> @bigb1058 yaya, i was agreeing with your original statement.  :)
[1:53:58] <zmiIez> @prius_tv I dont think he means to say they are pro but rather that a lot of the past players had a higher level of routine in the way they play things which gave them an edge in not having to prac as much and focus

[1:55:16] <vek16_> brain farts
[1:55:16] <YUGNOVY> it was just confusion
[1:55:18] <n0r13k> @pruth30 they messed up a defuse and probably lost the game as a result. It was just a clusterfuck.
[1:55:22] <Cake315> a s1mple mistake ^^
[1:55:25] <snipestorm_344> is there another game?
[1:55:32] <froux01> He could be blocking "the guy with the kit". That's the negative of him getting on the bomb.
[1:55:34] <DullaTPG> that defuse  mistake shouldnt be the mistake we focus on why you lost the game
