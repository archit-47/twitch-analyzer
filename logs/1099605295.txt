[2:32:48] <choober> @fl0m people are historically bad at playing these games cause they dont play as a team
[2:32:48] <tomlbarden> you don't expect too much, but at the same time people just are kinda worse than you expect as a baseline
[2:32:49] <WretchedGrin> yes you play with pros daily lol
[2:32:51] <Fossil_X2> no. trades/utility usage/comms are required in a team game
[2:32:52] <eherlex> if you expect anything thats too much
[2:32:52] <sphhax> not right now, these players are just *not good*
[2:32:53] <dnillo> Fl0m just queue gold if you expect something
[2:32:54] <hetoUK> at this level you should expect some game sense and team cooperation @fl0m
[2:32:55] <CharlyTevez> NA LVL 10's KEKPOINT
[2:33:00] <dnbull> its wild, if youre not going to "try" like just play unrated games. Why is it that hard for people to understand.
[2:33:01] <roman_anderson> 50% of this game is just knowledge
[2:33:02] <Uwotm08> There's a difference between hope and expectation. We should always hope for more, but expecting it may be too much.

[5:01:21] <Speedrulez> fleury was your guys goalie who popped off last year right fl0m?
[5:01:24] <Mr_Dew_> @GKaayy the guy started planting at like 3.5 seconds or so, watch the xray
[5:01:27] <paapoWeird> He already said he might retire if traded. Now we just have to see if that's what happens
[5:01:30] <jetrae55> the man has 3 cups and his vezna he should call it
[5:01:31] <jockst3r> @Speedrulez yes
[5:01:31] <EffitAhl> You got rid of flower?

[5:01:45] <GKaayy> you can see the plant
[5:01:47] <Pinkledwrenis> @Speedrulez yes he won best goalie of the year (vezina trophy)
[5:01:48] <GKaayy> it looks shorter
[5:01:58] <Chezpuf> is fl0m anti-overlay??? peepoRiot
[5:01:59] <Voidism_> the animation is messed up because of spectating

[5:09:32] <Killer_Panda2k11> Mythic Dirt League Pog
[5:09:34] <tazee15> @zHustlin <3 <3 <3
[5:09:34] <priiide_> its just hard in my mind to justify paying for mythic when im not that invested into cs
[5:09:36] <evil_m0rti> fuck mythic for working
[5:09:40] <Znowleopard> invite eu players to bronze ;)
[5:09:40] <bigdaddydave1> @fl0m I'm hard elo stuck bronze. go to free, i'm great, get back in bronze and I get smacked lmfao
[5:09:52] <Voidism_> I'm a bad player and idk where to start with playing in mythic league
[5:09:55] <BudDiesel> Look.. our players wake up in the morning and piss excellence..
[5:09:59] <spoonyaardvark> @fl0m I don't think silvers are going to want to pay for a league, unfortunately.
[5:10:00] <NextDoorGuy> free week is the best way, people love free shit
[5:10:02] <Simexgg> @fl0m go on mm and mass spam evrysingle player you come across
[5:10:03] <smoke_show> I'd play!
[5:10:03] <dead_ner0> sign me up Kappa
[5:10:04] <Simexgg> :D
[5:10:06] <bluehipp0> I'm certainly bad enough, just have too much to do...
[5:10:10] <nuke_cs> well whatever you did in bronze, it worked cuz those players are terrible
[5:10:12] <TheRenegadeRonin> @fl0m plastic league incoming pepeSus
[5:10:12] <sl0od> uberch4rged knows some bad players, maybe he can help get people in mythic league
[5:10:16] <justfadingthings> i mean @fl0m if i had the money id join mythic league but since i just moved in with a friend and im tryna get a job just aint it rn
[5:10:16] <Tagon35> I only support mythic league financially.

[5:10:23] <jzk777> new players just don't know abt faceit in general usually let alone hubs so it's harder to get them in bronze
[5:10:30] <priiide_> fl0m i think for a lot of bad players its hard to justify paying for a monthly subscription to a league
[5:10:33] <sleeeeppyyyy> WICKEDCock
[5:10:34] <sleeeeppyyyy> WICKEDCock WICKEDCock
[5:10:34] <priiide_> its me
[5:10:36] <priiide_> im bad player
[5:10:40] <sleeeeppyyyy> priiide_ KEKWait
[5:10:40] <a_HamHawk> @fl0m it's the subscription that turned me off mythic. I'm not good enough to want to pay a subscription
[5:10:41] <Rossaroni> good morning/afternoon fl0m and chat depending on where you are
[5:10:41] <messyhair> ^ same
[5:10:42] <jakehascak3> Get me a better computer than a macbook and ill play in silver league
[5:10:45] <a732v> Its just hard for new/bad/casual payers to justify paying a monthly fee to play CS regardless of how affordable it is imo
[5:10:49] <m4lki3r> Do you have to pay to be in mythic?
[5:10:51] <bluehipp0> @jzk777 or players have almost no time to play/practice and are bad because of that
[5:10:52] <priiide_> sleeeeppyyyy WICKEDCock
[5:10:53] <evil_m0rti> yea I mean if u pay u r kinda forced to improve
[5:10:56] <zellers4> Here me out, is there a way to get bronze to be free for everyone? like normal faceit? once they hit ahigher rank they have to start a subscrption
[5:10:57] <sleeeeppyyyy> WICKEDCock

[5:11:02] <toothpickmusic> i kind of like the format fornite does with arena, if you get what im saying
[5:11:02] <p4v1x> Make tournament for low ranks only, no 1-10 lvl but 1-4 lvl tournament and stuff like that. That’d help
[5:11:05] <sleeeeppyyyy> POGGERS
[5:11:06] <priiide_> sleeeeppyyyy nice

[5:11:24] <spoonyaardvark> @fl0m could you give away bronze codes? get some people in

[5:11:28] <evil_m0rti> flom Eureka moment?
[5:11:35] <jzk777> not if i do it b4 u sleeeeppyyyy PepeLaugh
[5:11:42] <SorrowInRain> after so many attempts, finally sleeeeppyyyy did it pepeLaughing
[5:11:44] <priiide_> would bronze not just become a cesspool then?
[5:11:49] <a_HamHawk> Could I get a cheaper rate for a set number of games?
[5:11:55] <Speedrulez> WICKEDCock
[5:11:56] <priiide_> cause low ranked free faceit is a cesspoo
[5:11:57] <priiide_> l
[5:11:57] <Justhoohaa> so when naha was smurfing in silver he was actually trying to boost your numbers.
[5:11:58] <sleeeeppyyyy> SorrowInRain what you mean? that was my fourth paapoWeird
[5:11:58] <jzk777> or u play it yourself spud PauseFish
[5:12:03] <bluehipp0> @jzk777 I'm saying the same reason that some people are bad (like me) is the reason they can't regularly play: lack of time

[5:12:31] <spoonyaardvark> @fl0m free trials would be perfect.
[5:12:33] <m4lki3r> I have a hard time spending money on something I know that I won't get anything back out of it and there is no way to keep smurfs out of it to ruin it.
[5:12:34] <evil_m0rti> dew it
[5:12:35] <sloveCS> we do have free trials
[5:12:36] <jzk777> bluehipp0 NODDERS i was just confused cuz i wasn't talking abt that KEKW
[5:12:37] <spoonyaardvark> Sadge
[5:12:37] <an7iwnl> what is level 1 faceit compared to mm rank? @fl0m
[5:12:38] <videnzio> flommmmmmmmmmmmm venezuela in the hubbbbbbbbbbbbbb:D::DD
[5:12:45] <sloveCS> people still use it
[5:12:46] <Speedrulez> sloveCS, for how long?
[5:12:47] <MattMeeko> Would you get smurfs if bronze was free? idk how faceit works
[5:12:49] <BudDiesel> So the logic behind free trials is that people have something.. then they can't not have it.. so they pay.. be a good way to increase subs if you could set that up..
[5:12:51] <sloveCS> 3d
[5:12:51] <ImJustJoshinYa2> ImJustJoshinYa2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[5:13:23] <Nightbot> 2560×1440 16:9
[5:13:23] <bluehipp0> @jzk777 no problem: I'm just saying I know about faceit, I just don't find the time or energy to play
[5:13:25] <star_made123> But fl0m you own faceit why dont you just make so everyone need to sub to mythic?
[5:13:26] <gomDxx> faceit ceo doesn't know his own league
[5:13:27] <LowRatedHighlander> @slovecs can we make that a command??
[5:13:28] <nortongabriel9> can you not offer refunds for 1 month for people that want them? @fl0m

[5:13:59] <jzk777> KEKPOINT too thicc
[5:14:00] <BudDiesel> Downside to free trial being that you would probably have an uptick in toxic behavior.. I mean even last night in bronze it was a bit rough with people who pay..

[5:17:03] <vchair23> I thought I heard you say something limiting it two pros- or maybe that was just stew/tarik, but should be really fun
[5:17:05] <STatisfacti0n> if you want to play faceit for free, there is an option. Mythic offers something somewhat different so free trials is the way to go for sure
[5:17:13] <pricej22> N OMEGALUL
