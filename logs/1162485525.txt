[0:30:56] <SoporificPanda> @yobtih valorant is likely the greatest team based fps of our lifetime. it has a very very high skills ceiling (you will see many csgo and overwatch players struggle with it). the weapon and hero balance is extremely well done. there are no hamsters and you can not be a 1 dimensional clutch player (for example, full time awper)
[0:31:00] <macbookfps> why did we even mod hitboy again after he asked to be unmodded KEKW

[3:35:41] <iizarian> is ttk way higher in valorant than cs?
[3:35:50] <iizarian> seems like they are dropping you mad quick
[3:35:52] <JeyyF> !rank
[3:35:52] <Nightbot> Fl0m is an ex-pro player who now streams full time. He is Rank S in ESEA and in FPL on FACEIT. His matchmaking rank is Global Elite (boosted by GTR). He is also Diamond something or other in VALORANT and Rank #1 in fucking dads. But no matter what, he will always be Rank #1 in our hearts smileW
[3:36:00] <SuperTuscan888> Sadge
[3:36:03] <ImTarco> ttk's about the same I would say.
[3:36:10] <silvernade> @iizarian yea its low and kinda luck based tbh
[3:36:33] <thejoestokes> @fl0m let the bucky set you free
[3:36:36] <headpatter_> @iizarian i think its less in valorant because noone tries to spray.
[3:36:39] <scribblesper> @iizarian the tagging is more punishing so it's easier to hit followups
[3:36:48] <Scyperr> jeez everyone got eviscerated
[3:36:53] <iizarian> true
[3:37:02] <bolottekid> did fl0m do aimlab before playing?
[3:37:07] <shakezla> @headpatter_ I mean have you tried to spray in valorant? it's random spray patterns
[3:37:08] <ImTarco> Y'all ever have one of those days where every human interaction just rubs you the wrong way? Cuz same.
[3:37:10] <LowRatedHighlander> Nope
[3:37:17] <SuperTuscan888> Hey fl0m smileW I don't like valorant, but I see that you're playing it. So I'm going to come into the stream, wait for the ads to be done, then let you know how I feel smileW pls don't ban smileW

[3:56:31] <trojanfake223> ayaya
[3:56:33] <absollutte> maybe guns should be cheapers? with how the economy works etc
[3:56:36] <absollutte> cheaper
[3:56:38] <Mumflr830> speedrun global any%
[3:56:41] <AMutantCookie> or it should take a few more wins in short games to rank up imo
[3:56:41] <silvernade> play the headshot angles
[3:56:49] <Uwotm08> It's 5v5, the main difference is the extra-large impact of the early economy on the rest of the game.
[3:57:05] <jockst3r> Personally in mm I think the rank and elo gain and all that should be the same as long games
[3:57:06] <AFugy> you're not going to be shockingly better at short or long games
[3:57:09] <absollutte> WICKED

[3:57:30] <Uwotm08> @AMutantCookie Rumour has it that rankups/deranks are primarily based on number of rounds won, not matches won, so short matches don't disbalance ranks too much.
