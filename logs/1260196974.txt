[1:25:56] <cloutburstgg> @corver for a sec i thought u were talking about the real AOC KEKWaddle
[1:25:56] <Cacemen> tarkov is a good game but you need to grind a lot to be decent I feel. I would love to but I don't have the time for that
[1:25:56] <waferthinmint> Tarkov needs to release on steam, I dont wanna download their strange thirdparty launcher
[1:25:56] <SuperTuscan888> twennyNumbers Bedge

[1:26:15] <pan1cc3> the cycle frontier right?
[1:26:16] <the_kung> there are 2 type of MMO RPG:s, gameplay focused and story focused. Gameplay/content focused will never be as big as WoW because it'll be too similar. Story focused ones are popular as long as there's new storylines released
[1:26:20] <Speedrulez> KEKWait is mr Bedge here
[1:26:23] <Speedrulez> sopo gtrH

[1:26:26] <Pawn7> cycle was fun
[1:26:28] <sjoerdtheman> NERVg i dont think the gameplay allowed for pvp and the fact that there was basically 0 customization would make it boring too

[2:37:40] <STatisfacti0n> @formerlygood all good. now you understand. Basically it boils down to streamers being able to be banned for not moderating their chat

[2:38:57] <formerlygood> @STatisfacti0n that actually makes the most sense about being able to effectively moderate chat. My initial reaction was like "wow what if a Spanish speaking viewer with bad English wants to hang out here" you know?
[2:39:00] <LowRatedHighlander> Like if you ask what kinda meat I like in mandarin I got you

[2:39:53] <twennyNumbers> peepoSitHey theHovnival
[2:39:55] <STatisfacti0n> @formerlygood lol yeah, it really just boils down to moderating chat. Obviously everyone is welcome, we just can't effectively moderate the chat when other languages are being spoken so it's better to just not allow it than risk offensive/racist things to be said and us to just allow it because we don't know

[4:29:10] <sjoerdtheman> nnqtr20_ video is probably outdated, he switches crosshair pretty regularly
[4:29:13] <lukemm> If you aren't driving it absolutely. You could get close to what you paid for it if not more than that. The new WRX being ugly is making everyone panic buy the current gen KEKW
