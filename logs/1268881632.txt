[1:05:59] <acesssz> COL keeps throwing. Why are they rushing after getting an entry, chill and think about the round, 5vs4 to 2vs4 in 10seconds
[1:06:00] <GreenPhoenix044> going against the second best team rn in your first game is unlucky
[1:06:05] <DrayAUS> COL has done incredibly well this game for having a player on 200 ping

[1:51:00] <DaE_dAe11> it's literally cheaper to get a pre-built pc. It's even cheaper to just a whole new pc then doing upgrades. @fl0m
[1:51:00] <Tmansterr> I went pre built IBP after 2 self built ones
[1:51:04] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m that of course does not mean that it will be

[2:22:27] <uberargyle> @LowRatedHighlander I think the rest of the team underperforming a bit (less Floppy) also helps in a way.
[2:22:31] <SandwichSundays> @daba_roux you could see it as a spectator, but sh1ro wasn't ever on grim's screen
[2:22:33] <crest_x> jame god
