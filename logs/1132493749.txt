[0:11:33] <Bolly> @macbookfps I have no idea how the game works so I can't reasonably set one up
[0:11:45] <macbookfps> Bolly lowrated used to do "will they pass the mission"
[0:11:51] <macbookfps> cause fl0m is doing these individual challenge cards
[0:12:03] <duLuded> @mccr00o i queued into fl0m a few times on faceit, i played against him and get right last week
[0:12:04] <BooomerNinja> Ah so fl0m is carrying the negev of this game i see NODDERS
[0:12:16] <macbookfps> since fl0m and seagull have such advanced gear, they'll clear the level pretty easy
[0:12:21] <macbookfps> but may not complete the challenge
[0:12:23] <mccr00o> @duLuded thats dope
