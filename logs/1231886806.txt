[1:52:28] <BozzyRL> So any time I've been playing games with higher graphics, my monitor is getting like weird straight line randomly across it like its screen tearing or something. Is there some graphic setting that i need to look at to stop that? Its always horizontal and just looks like distorted for a bit
[1:53:10] <Scruffeh_The_Janitor> PUBG 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
[1:53:26] <Bolly> vsync or adaptive sync would (mostly) resolve screen tearing
[1:53:33] <Bolly> assuming that's what happening
[1:53:48] <kennyyulr> or the smooth frame option + dlss
[1:54:29] <BozzyRL> @Bolly I'll try that. Also last thing, what is FXAA and MSAA and should those be on or off for most games?
[1:54:48] <MANIKcc> @BozzyRL sounds like a sync issue at first glance, those are anti-aliasing settings
[1:55:01] <Bolly> FXAA is a really cheap method for anti-aliasing (it looks like shit); MSAA is a very expensive anti-aliasing method

[2:19:10] <WookiePotamus> I get like 10 more minutes of hope before the game starts
[2:19:10] <LucidR9> but you do you

[2:22:23] <supra_nightmare> need one please
[2:22:26] <WookiePotamus> and like my fave player will always be  Devin Hester that was also part of the reason I picked the bears
[2:22:28] <STatisfacti0n> oh top 5 is a good pick NODDERS
[2:22:31] <supra_nightmare> no nvm
[2:22:33] <supra_nightmare> mb
[2:22:36] <supra_nightmare> Crungo
[2:22:36] <LucidR9> I liked eli manning for literally no reason
[2:22:39] <LucidR9> now that im older
[2:22:44] <LucidR9> im like bruh he really aint all that
[2:22:59] <STatisfacti0n> Eli Manning was a great QB until Pat Shurmur fucked him
[2:23:00] <WookiePotamus> listening to his Kick off return for a touch down to start the super bowl ingrained in my memory for ever
[2:23:04] <supra_nightmare> the only player i genuinely enjoyed watching in the NFL was Troy Polamalu
[2:23:04] <sneakyness> as a detroit lions fan (LUL) I sometimes watch barry sanders highlight reels and cry
[2:23:07] <LucidR9> he was a great QB until he wasn't
[2:23:16] <STatisfacti0n> and as a Broncos fan, I wish Pat Shurmur would be fired out of hte league
[2:23:21] <LucidR9> the thing is he happened to fluctuate a lot

[2:23:36] <scribblesper> i'm enjoying garapollo kittle
[2:23:42] <STatisfacti0n> but when he was playing well he was playing very well
[2:23:44] <LucidR9> I also liked him cause I was the younger brother in my family
[2:23:45] <MANIKcc> typical bot behavior

[2:24:17] <LucidR9> oh for sure
[2:24:26] <WookiePotamus> Tebow > Payton @statisfacti0n
[2:24:27] <LucidR9> I would never argue eli was better

[2:25:07] <scribblesper> wasnt tebow mlb career a farce
[2:25:09] <STatisfacti0n> yes he did
[2:25:12] <LucidR9> he made it

[2:26:29] <LucidR9> he TECHNICALLY made it to the MLB
[2:26:29] <STatisfacti0n> yeah the mets signed him, not sure if he ever played though. I really didn't care to follow Tebow LUL
[2:26:33] <Ronnie143> @LucidR9 how popular is MLB compared to NBA and NFL. I'm a NBA kinda guy
[2:26:38] <Ronnie143> ?\
[2:26:40] <LucidR9> I would say NFL is bigger

[2:26:54] <STatisfacti0n> NFL is more popular in the US I'd say but the MLB extends beyond just the US
[2:26:55] <WookiePotamus> NFL is way bigger
[2:26:57] <sneakyness> ok i just finished downloading this imma give it a rip
[2:26:58] <supra_nightmare> Tim tebow was unnecessarily popular, he never did a single thing to be popular
[2:27:04] <LucidR9> supra_nightmare man made two major leagues
[2:27:06] <LucidR9> that's impressive
[2:27:07] <LucidR9> fym
[2:27:12] <STatisfacti0n> Tim Tebow was also HUGE in college
[2:27:17] <LucidR9> well yeah
[2:27:20] <scribblesper> nfl biggest in NA, nba biggest worldwide, mlb is big is latam and jap/korea
[2:27:38] <BrotherJon> NFL is much bigger in the US, but I'd say that Baseball has a lot more clout worldwide

[2:28:07] <STatisfacti0n> the stuff the Broncos did today to show respects to Demaryius Thomas was awesome
[2:28:14] <WookiePotamus> unless it's like a game 7 or something
[2:28:17] <STatisfacti0n> and the last touchdown drive they had was 88 yards
[2:28:26] <supra_nightmare> before I move to the US I had never heard of NFL. we had heard of gridiron, that's pretty much it. but everyone had heard of the New York Yankees and the White Sox

[2:29:06] <Geyser56> HI WOOKIE
[2:29:07] <whitecoffeegaming> Yeah and baseball is just everywhere
[2:29:09] <WookiePotamus> well baseball
[2:29:11] <BrotherJon> MLB is huge in local markets, but not so much as a national product. And that was built that way because of the newspaper guys and that the "old crowd" has a measure of sway regarding how things continue to be done.
[2:29:15] <dims_cs> sponsored? or u like the game fl0mothy
[2:29:17] <STatisfacti0n> ngl, the Broncos only having 10 men out on the field and having a WR sit and taking the delay of game in honor of DT kinda choked me up LUL
[2:29:19] <WookiePotamus> hi Geyser
[2:29:24] <STatisfacti0n> on the first play
[2:29:33] <whitecoffeegaming> @STatisfacti0n yeah
[2:29:38] <BrotherJon> I think that if we took a more international approach to how baseball is viewed in other countries, baseball would be a LOT more popular.
[2:29:38] <boostedbyduoq> which dlss do i use
[2:29:49] <STatisfacti0n> classy way to do it and really classy by the Lions to decline the penalty

[2:30:20] <Ronnie143> how about Ice hockey not that big in the US? watch some nasty fights for hockey pretty entertaining.
[2:30:21] <STatisfacti0n> @WookiePotamus yeah, dude was at times frustrating to watch in the latter part of his career but he was such a good guy
[2:30:28] <BrotherJon> @whitecoffeegaming during the pandemic when they showed a lot of the Korean and Japanese baseball leagues playing, I thought that was so much more fun to watch.
[2:30:36] <tygrx> hey flom. just got here how are you?
[2:30:39] <whitecoffeegaming> @Ronnie143 ice hockey is big in some plaves
[2:30:53] <STatisfacti0n> yeah, the cost to entry of football is super cheap
[2:31:01] <STatisfacti0n> $15 football and you're good to go learn the basics
[2:31:02] <BrotherJon> Tampa Bay is a hockey powerhouse Kappa
[2:31:05] <WookiePotamus> Skating is so fucking fun I miss it so much being out on the WC
[2:31:11] <theD0RF> Korean Baseball is lit. They rid themselves of the "unwritten rules" and just play for fun. Bat flips and shit. It's fun to watch, but any MLB player would prolly go and wreck shit.
[2:31:13] <STatisfacti0n> same with soccer
[2:31:30] <whitecoffeegaming> @BrotherJon It depends for me, I like the MLB but some of the japanese and korean games are just fun when you dont really have a dog in the fight

[2:31:37] <STatisfacti0n> lol
[2:31:42] <whitecoffeegaming> @theD0RF Their playoffs are weird too
[2:31:53] <LucidR9> hockey is really hard to follow if you want to watch as a casual viewer
[2:32:02] <whitecoffeegaming> its the playoff system from those Gamevil Baseball games on mobile
[2:32:11] <WookiePotamus> I watched a hockey game where the announcers got muted and it was just the crowd honestly best game I've ever watched KEKW

[2:32:33] <joewoess> this kinda looks like a modern pubg sumDuck
[2:32:33] <BozzyRL> Ice hockey is big in the US. Its not as popular as NFL or MLB, but look at the talent pool and especially the last few years of the USNTDP and the World Juniors teams. Saying hockey isnt big in the US is kinda an understatement. Especially with ESPN picking it up to televise
[2:32:47] <LucidR9> I just hear hella names and then i hear SCOOOOORES

[2:37:51] <supra_nightmare> LUL
[2:37:52] <MANIKcc> I wash my fruit before I eat it I mean
[2:37:58] <whitecoffeegaming> yeah thats different

[2:38:03] <BooomerNinja> Wookie is the Ramsey of ramen i guess

[2:38:05] <LucidR9> rice comes directly from fields, which can have bugs and bacteria, pasta has to be made from grain, which means it's already cleaned.
[2:38:10] <whitecoffeegaming> ramen is fucking ramen that shits getting boiled that kills germs
[2:38:16] <LucidR9> check fucking mate wookie
[2:38:19] <whitecoffeegaming> rice is already cleaned anyway
[2:38:36] <WookiePotamus> U put it in boiling fucking water lucid
[2:38:38] <whitecoffeegaming> I wash my rice because it gets rid of this like starch shit and the rice is fluffier in the end
[2:38:39] <supra_nightmare> wookie doesnt even wash his balls and gives us a hard time if we dont wash something
[2:38:45] <LucidR9> was my ass wookie
[2:38:45] <The_Ganznoob> plus washing your rice actually removes a lot of the starch which makes the rice taste better
[2:38:47] <whitecoffeegaming> that starch shit almost acts like glue
[2:38:49] <Nightbot> Latest video: WTF is going on in this CS:GO Game!? - https://youtu.be/RdpKJJP8_ck
[2:39:01] <whitecoffeegaming> washing it gets rid of it and makes it fluffier and looser
[2:39:11] <whitecoffeegaming> it works better in fried rice
[2:39:20] <WookiePotamus> what if I want it hard and sticky
[2:39:26] <WookiePotamus> smileW

[2:39:35] <whitecoffeegaming> I also put a tea towel under the lid after I finish boiling all the water away for a few minutes
[2:39:37] <supra_nightmare> all you right there
[2:39:39] <whitecoffeegaming> it makes the rice drier
[2:39:46] <whitecoffeegaming> and it is even fluffer
[2:39:49] <whitecoffeegaming> that is the best
[2:40:03] <WookiePotamus> pass
[2:40:08] <whitecoffeegaming> also the more egg in fried rice = better change my mind
