[2:01:55] <whitechocolate64> as someone who has like 300+ hours in bloons and 2.5k hours in csgo, this is the crossover I never imagined I'd see
[2:01:56] <praeter15> boob
[2:02:00] <iTysonator252> thereis a setting that will make the rounds start automattically
[2:02:02] <fricks_lozf> praety waety AYAYA
[2:02:08] <praeter15> sticky fricky AYAYA
[2:02:08] <Mr_Dew_> 5-0*
[2:02:09] <whitechocolate64> chat dont shame me for my bloons hours plz
[2:02:09] <iTysonator252> its nice for the flow of the game
[2:02:12] <hypra1> time to sous vide some steakaroos
[2:02:27] <hypra1> peace out chat
[2:02:32] <JayMehta29> is this bloons 6?
[2:02:39] <whitechocolate64> @JayMehta29 YEP
[2:02:41] <2nd_ree_kid> @fl0m 0-2-4 banana market is SOOOOOOOO GOOD
[2:02:48] <fedoralva> Gamba for next map being mirage or ancient?
[2:03:02] <whitechocolate64> @2nd_ree_kid 2-0-4 is actually more efficient
[2:03:05] <schultzymo> !bracket
[2:03:05] <Nightbot> ESEA Cash Cup https://play.esea.net/index.php?s=events&d=brackets&id=1131
[2:04:01] <SvetoMD> wot de fok is this game
[2:04:04] <2nd_ree_kid> @2nd_ree_kid I don't think so no cuz you get a lot more money for 0-2-4
[2:04:18] <rektar> 6969$ Kappa
[2:04:27] <bigboy1520> Adora is a very good hero, I've been using her with a lot of success, would recomment
[2:04:30] <mandime819> mewsRaze mewsRaze mewsRaze
[2:04:37] <iVex> @whitechocolate64 0 2 3+ is more efficient
[2:04:38] <chicken_wings31> i remember the good ol days with star craft/warcraft tower defense modes
[2:04:59] <whitechocolate64> @2nd_ree_kid 0-2-4 turns bananas value from $20 to $25, but 2-0-4 doubles the amount of bananas produced. So 2-0-4 makes way more money
[2:05:25] <whitechocolate64> @iVex trust me its not lol
[2:05:31] <iVex> trust me it is
[2:05:33] <2nd_ree_kid> @whitechocolate64 0-2-4 makes it 87$ a banana
[2:05:50] <JayMehta29> @fl0m how long till next match?
[2:05:58] <schultzymo> next match gotta be close
[2:06:02] <iVex> 91 with monkey knowledge @2nd_ree_kid
[2:06:11] <schultzymo> its assigned
[2:06:23] <Nightbot> Hey! You! Did you know fl0m now has a THIRD Youtube Channel? Well now you do! GO SUBSCRIBE!!! Quick Fl0m: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3zM_ina0NwCcOi7tr2LBQ
[2:06:36] <2nd_ree_kid> @fl0m try the 0-2-4 banna market it gives 87$ a banana super good
[2:06:45] <MegaGeese> Hi chat peepoArrive
[2:06:55] <Moobot> Plebs can only use 10 emotes per chat. (@ruben_slater) (warning)
[2:07:01] <whitechocolate64> yeah but 2-0-4 makes it $70 per banana, and twice as many bananas per round. So it would be the same as $140 per banana. Trust me ive got 330 hours in btd6 lmao
