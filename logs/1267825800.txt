[0:22:56] <andrewmedaTV> they won't block it
[0:22:59] <dweevers> it could fl0m, it makes them the 3rd largest gaming company

[0:23:07] <justdanny> i mean right now all they have acquired is skyrim ports
[0:23:08] <m4lki3r> No way. They already own a gaming company and it wont be a competitive advantage so they'll let it go through.

[0:24:23] <jokkerbo> I'm excited, I think Blizzard can do well under te Xbox Gaming umbrella
[0:24:25] <Cian> WoW on game pass would be insane
[0:24:27] <redsox4evur> Cian I don't think there will be one, tbh. And if there is it won't last long. This is similar to the Fox and Disney deal, which there was no real issue with.
[0:24:29] <justdanny> hoenst take

[0:24:45] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m I don't even play classic anymore Sadge
[0:24:45] <hobrev> so any change would probably be for the better
[0:24:49] <Nemutai_jpeg> shit i didnt even think about game pass
[0:24:50] <justdanny> game pass wow and add more microtransactions
[0:24:52] <dweevers> LowRatedHighlander sony and tencent are larger and tencent dwarfs both of them still
[0:25:10] <not_ian> hopefully this means we get wrath classic sooner YEP
[0:25:11] <Cian> @redsox4evur, I dont think anything will come from it but I deff think theres gonna be some sort of suit considering Microsoft just bought Bethesda too
[0:25:13] <waduheckfossy> game pass for 10 yr old games

[1:52:29] <mukulhayaran> woah is this a new map added to Counter Strike Global Offensive? de_mirage? ive never heard of it when did they add this map it looks really fun i think it would be really enjoyable to play for a 6th time in a day it wouldnt feel repetitive at all bombsite B seems like a cool site to push every round on the T side and the A site seems very cool because it seems like you could throw an entire 4 smokes that are completely necessary to taking the site which seems really cool i think so
[1:52:30] <cowcranky> I am aware of the functional parameters of what is currently transpiring and fully understand that streamer is not throwing but is in fact performing a trick so mind boggling to the common viewer that it can be viewed as such.

[2:53:03] <devilris3s> @KodaRG owwwwww hmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:53:08] <Stogie6> TonyBats Depends on level. I solo queued for the first time in 2 years recently and it was worse than my MM games

[2:53:20] <Stogie6> but lots of people have good experiences too TonyBats
[2:53:21] <J0nssi_> @andrewmedaTV i have a G7 already, why would I downgrade my monitor :o
[2:53:28] <Cacemen> @Justhoohaa I think that is just CS in general. It just changes the amount of sanity you lose from platform to platform
[2:53:32] <LowRatedHighlander> @justinimii important I mean
[2:53:34] <samtera> Does anyone know if dad gets a kickback from me ordering an aimlab hoodie?
[2:53:34] <TonyBats> damn, well im a gn on MM so i'd imagine the lower face it levels being kinda whack
[2:53:34] <hemo_tox> @justinimii not many that i've found. You aren't able to joint he "Premium Queue" and thats about it
[2:53:43] <VashTS1> @justinimii sometimes you will get people with paid subscriptions that can auto veto maps. other than that nothing,.

[2:55:22] <SillyBonesGG> my neighbor had a husky in miami and it was a joyous dog. not necessarily a stance on its morality

[3:07:08] <SovietChill> #1 TaRiK
[3:07:12] <s1mply_AnT> @dequavo556 They popped off the beginning of the year plus LAN wasn't a disappointment
[3:07:18] <andrewmedaTV> I don't think Zywoo should be #2 this year. Although him and Niko are close
[3:07:21] <Kurintoi> this stat guy seems to be bringing down the team...
[3:07:29] <iBUYPOWER> widepeepo
[3:07:32] <LeXCS> I should’ve asked to play this map. I wouldn’t be on a heating pad chewing ibuprofen right now and you would’ve won already
[3:07:33] <vstojanov> it could be #2 NiKo
[3:07:34] <Kurintoi> Peepo
[3:07:34] <the_kung> @dequavo556 no, personally I don't think he played that well
[3:07:36] <HeyItsVherbal> hey intern
[3:07:49] <s1mply_AnT> this stat guys pretty good, you should give him mod or something

[3:08:44] <Justhoohaa> I just don't think the gambit guys should have been below electronic. idc if they played better in the online. the lans should have counted much more
[3:08:45] <samtera> ?
[3:08:59] <s1mply_AnT> that was cute

[3:09:41] <priiide_> YEP hoohoo dumb
[3:09:42] <jonnypondwater> ranked higher
[3:09:43] <bassmaster1619> @Justhoohaa no u are not stop
[3:09:43] <LowRatedHighlander> @ninetyfivemonkeys congrats!!!! PEPEDS

[3:09:52] <oldGiZ> another kill for stat, he's poppin off! :P
[3:09:55] <Justhoohaa> I miss typed. I meant I think electronic should have been ranked higher than axile and hobbit
[3:09:56] <KNAPKINAT0R> you def wanna be 20 overall duhhhh kekw
[3:09:57] <HeyItsVherbal> @ninetyfivemonkeys congrats
[3:09:59] <cs_java> I mean, I dont think Jame should have been numbe 10 or whatever lol all he did was save
[3:10:00] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @LowRatedHighlander  gachiHYPER  gachiHYPER  gachiHYPER
[3:10:01] <khal1dxD> Stuck 😳
[3:10:06] <Justhoohaa> maybe not sh1ro
[3:10:19] <the_kung> but if you only count LAN (or count it higher) then NiKo should be number one because he really did pop off the last few months
[3:10:21] <amethyst01_> this the last one for this stream or you running it back?
[3:10:23] <vso11> @cs_java he was callin strats though
[3:10:27] <Justhoohaa> but that means alot to me though.
[3:10:27] <PeepoConnoisseur> NODDERS
[3:10:27] <s1mply_AnT> sh1ro for sure is number 4 or Ill gift 5
[3:10:28] <Nightbot> Latest video: Best CS:GO Silver Plays of 2021 - https://youtu.be/DNO2XsRzIOk
[3:10:42] <Justhoohaa> fair
[3:10:44] <KNAPKINAT0R> i think b1t should have possibly ranked higher then electronic
[3:10:44] <dequavo556> recency bias would make niko #1 prob
[3:10:58] <LeXCS> Ya I feel like everyone talking about that forgot the first 8 months of the year
[3:11:01] <FletcherB10> yea but its weird bc last year lan was so important in the rankings

[3:11:12] <justiey> @fl0m did you watch the stewie2k goodbye video from liquid? was a banger
[3:11:12] <TonyBats> Shiro is above elec, idk about zywoo imo. but i think Ax1le higher is weird
[3:11:15] <macbookfps> @dequavo556 you mean niko who whiffed on nuke?
[3:11:15] <dequavo556> entry fragger flom
[3:11:18] <PeepoConnoisseur> YEP surely they put niko in #2
[3:11:18] <Dankner> the thing I find funny is sh1ro is higher than b1t but b1t got rookie of the year which technically makes no sense (i think b1t deserved it fwiw)
[3:11:24] <Justhoohaa> sh1ro 100% should have been above electronic regardless. but to me axile and hobbit shouldn't have been

[3:11:41] <Justhoohaa> imo obviously
[3:11:41] <justkcsgo> 1 - s1mple, 2 - zywoo, 3- niko, 4 - sh1ro
[3:11:44] <vchair23> yeah would need to weight lan at like 70% to get all the gambit guys to significant drop probably
[3:11:44] <the_kung> Zywoo will most definitely be #2
[3:11:49] <LowRatedHighlander> I could see him getting above zywoo honestly

[3:11:58] <Thugs_Bunny268> honestly fk those 8 months tho
[3:12:00] <sloveCS> dank #1 hltv in my heart
[3:12:06] <nyvoc_tv> wdym Ax1le was an insane rifler online @TonyBats
[3:12:11] <jockst3r> imo niko was #1 this year
[3:12:25] <Dankner> sloveeeee my lover
[3:12:26] <s1mply_AnT> @nyvoc_tv performed really well on lan too
[3:12:27] <furdahcs> macbookfps wanna uhhhhh play some faceit
[3:12:27] <Justhoohaa> I personally think s1mple Niko sh1ro zywoo .
[3:12:28] <dequavo556> gambit was absolutely dicking on teams online but had a semi decent fall off on lan
[3:12:43] <junior_monk3y> Device should move to some good team
[3:12:43] <dequavo556> kovac cousin + m0nesy Kreygasm
[3:12:47] <einmann17> Elec has a rating of 1.10 online this year wich places him in 11 place, other than that he he ranked at nr4 by rating att the  major, big events and lan
[3:12:48] <ninetyfivemonkeys> sh1ro, niko, s1mple, zywoo. what's the ranking out of the 4
[3:12:50] <macbookfps> @furdahcs rn? monkaS
[3:12:53] <LowRatedHighlander> @justhoohaa that’s a good lineup
[3:12:55] <furdahcs> in 10ish
[3:13:01] <l3ordon> S1mple had more success, NiKo was the best player tho
[3:13:12] <ninetyfivemonkeys> i think: 1 - niko | 2 - sh1ro | 3 - s1mple | 4 - zywoo

[3:13:16] <the_kung> @l3ordon agreed
[3:13:18] <s1mply_AnT> I think the only variable is zywoo and sh1ro can be interchangeable
[3:13:23] <dequavo556> and niko did it with a rifle too, no slightly inflated awp stats
[3:13:26] <macbookfps> @furdahcs sure in 10, finishing up my lunch

[3:14:03] <s1mply_AnT> @junior_monk3y new team, not feeling the same comfortability
[3:14:06] <Justhoohaa> I know I joked about sh1ro cheating all year. but honestly he played better than zywoo for sure this year
[3:14:09] <jockst3r> thats insane
[3:14:19] <the_kung> @junior_monk3y and him being ill
[3:14:22] <LowRatedHighlander> I mean device also said he had some pretty big mental issues for the year
[3:14:22] <PeepoConnoisseur> Peepo 65% entry
[3:14:26] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @Justhoohaa his impact was significant. but hes not a flashy aggressive awper
