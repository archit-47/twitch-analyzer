[0:19:47] <Syndie> @Kafkii from their press release they said they were expanding the league to brazil too so atm its looking good

[0:19:48] <Nightbot> Joris says 97%
[0:19:48] <LowRatedHighlander> because at the end of the day theyre running a business if they want it to thrive it would hurt if they did stuff
[0:19:51] <twennyNumbers> ok
[0:19:51] <007deman> Whats with the dad music
[0:19:57] <Floofys> LowRatedHighlander maybe it should be the catalyst that gets more women and LGBT folks into the game?

[0:20:59] <twennyNumbers> why would you do that yo yourself
[0:21:00] <Floofys> @GFYMeowMix is it gross?
[0:21:08] <GFYMeowMix> it's been years
[0:21:15] <LowRatedHighlander> cause the plan for the womans league had to coincide around the same time as the deal talks
[0:21:17] <S1lentFr3ddy> Jammies
[0:21:20] <babar_en_avion> I saw that fpl and esl merged, but what are the downsides that people are worried about @fl0m
[0:21:20] <scribblesper> people give me billions everyday, it's cause i'm really smart
[0:21:21] <sidcsss> how does ESL make money?
[0:21:30] <babar_en_avion> Im not up on the news
[0:21:33] <GFYMeowMix> it's not bad but not great. still enjoy it but it's not something i ever seek out or crave SHRUGGERS
[0:21:41] <apoodle_> whoever bought esl and faceit obviously looked into what kind or audience they serce, and they will have come to the conclusion that subverting the companies to something fundamentally different will just lead to the new company folding

[0:21:44] <nareshkatra> does ESL host CSGO events for the majority right ? like i know they have other games but what is their main focus on
[0:21:54] <messiah666rc> Multiple Teams are owned by SA. Manchester City, PSG, for example. They have women teams, etc

[2:36:04] <1amdaredevil> why change the oil? I just change cars
[2:36:09] <LeBoomstickPBP> like I should be going on miles because I drive mine A LOT ('13 CR-V) so it just runs out before I would need to on time
[2:36:11] <froster5226> every 6 mos is usually fine

[2:42:42] <Mussel25> @1amdaredevil +1
[2:42:46] <beembuoy> EG shoulda signed sezi or jojo
[2:42:58] <1amdaredevil> @beembuoy JoJo is too tall for EG
[2:43:05] <SpykerLOL> like missed opportunity for EG. They could have gotten fl0m I mean.. top-notch guy

[2:44:18] <WookiePotamus> @c0rkmcnortis more awpers what if we have jojo and slugy stand on top of each other and play boom u get an extra awper
[2:44:31] <matty_phresh> just got into watching pro CS in 2019 and EG have been irrelevant since
[2:44:40] <sleeeeppyyyy> can someone tell me what this man is talking about? seems like he doesnt know what hes talking about WeirdEyes
[2:44:41] <Mentalstatemike> Rush? more like THE ROCK
[2:44:49] <peej2189> @matty_phresh cap.. they were gas in 2020 up until the last 1/3 of it
[2:44:51] <fuzzy75> honesly a bunch of people who never touched the game would have better then previous EG lineup
[2:44:52] <Sketchy_Antix> peepoHigh
[2:44:57] <vinciCS> people question autimatics ability to "get back in the game" but I don't hear nitro critiqued the same way. Liquid will probably do better off the bat, but they will struggle sooner and for longer. EG has the biggest chance to stabilize sooner
[2:45:03] <Mentalstatemike> peepoHigh
[2:45:07] <WookiePotamus> you think EG is in a rush with this roster fl0mHmm
