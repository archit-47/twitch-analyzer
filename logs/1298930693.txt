[1:12:50] <moszkval> i feel like hockey is jus easier to watch casually than baseball is as well
[1:12:51] <Erock5852> hockey best sport no doubt
[1:12:53] <suggard> NHL is very entertaining. Fights are sure fun, and the smaller rink
[1:12:53] <moszkval> baseball too slow at times
[1:12:54] <erk12> hockey is the best sport that is true
[1:12:56] <11placeholder11> as a stars fan I do have a love hate relationship with it tho

[1:13:24] <AMutantCookie> Baseball is for huge nerds
[1:13:24] <MuscularThighz> Hockey is to enjoy, Baseball is to play fantasy.
[1:13:24] <kcerwniart> hockey is super easy theres like 2 rules haha
[1:13:27] <xVeer> As someone who watches 150+ Braves games a year I am invested into the story
[1:13:32] <crypt1ci_i> watch people hit people thats all you need to do
[1:13:32] <debux> puck go in goal is good
[1:13:38] <erk12> with boxing
[1:13:40] <Justhoohaa> baseball is just as boring as golf
[1:13:40] <LeBoomstickPBP> I honestly love them both. It helps i grew up around baseball, but hockey is perfect for my brain. Broadcasting it is so fun
[1:13:41] <moszkval> LMFAO

[1:13:49] <king_roovv> who wants to pay $800 for skates
[1:13:50] <LVLs> can be hard to track the puck tho for a casual viewer
[1:13:53] <scruff304> It's easy to understand, but watching on TV it can be hard to track the puck
[1:13:53] <PeepoConnoisseur> NOPERS football is football on meth
[1:13:54] <suggard> Wish my parents wouldve had the money for me to play hockey FeelsBadMan
[1:13:55] <CodySiesta> @fl0m once people understand what icing is, hockey is super simple
[1:13:56] <Auggan> @Ewy_Qwarp why is a starter for a team not playing is not a stupid question

[1:14:33] <yungjin_r> how was torzi on nuke? I didn't get to see.
[1:14:33] <Justhoohaa> @leboomstickpbp not talking about playing. talking about watching
[1:14:35] <AMutantCookie> If you look at the goal when someone is shooting you learn to track the puck easier
[1:14:36] <Thatonekidmike> They used to have a trail
[1:14:37] <PigeonPantz> played hockey since I was 4, but offsides and icing are the only rules i find the uninitiated have difficulty with, that and maybe penalty stuff
[1:14:37] <MaanSaab> which hocky u guys are talking about ice or field ? fl0mHmm fl0mCozy
[1:14:38] <br0ther_> rainbow puck

[1:14:46] <tylersmokes> they used to do that its so bad
[1:14:46] <dada_iv> you can track the puck just by looking at the players LUL
[1:14:47] <rygaardhansen> they did that before - it wasn't good
[1:14:50] <erk12> didnt they try an outline
[1:14:50] <weeeegy> an outline like valorant
[1:14:50] <LeBoomstickPBP> @justhoohaa understanding some of the mental is part of watching

[1:15:10] <erk12> -nbk +jdc
[1:15:10] <HoseHead> In Canada we used to make fun of American hockey streams with the puck highlighted
[1:15:11] <poprumble_> hockey in the dark with a glowing puck
[1:15:13] <mthdtt13> put some LEDs on a puck
[1:15:13] <kittle_time> will puck is black on ice
[1:15:14] <crypt1ci_i> some rgb puck @fl0m
[1:15:14] <LeBoomstickPBP> @raasco nah penalties are good to explain too as they happen
[1:15:16] <Roya1tyCS> Mouz revenge arc is ruined by rona lol
[1:15:16] <varixalint> how has jks been this event
[1:15:20] <dnillo> jdc could easily be a perma switch
[1:15:20] <kcerwniart> @HoseHead those were such good times haha
[1:15:20] <SillyPanda> If you don't live near a major city look up AHL tickets. Best value imo. $15-20 for a minor league hockey game
[1:15:22] <silviu_cs> Bymas gonna get moved to NXT KEKW
[1:15:22] <greazywook> !1deag

[1:15:28] <11placeholder11> @mk_48 in the past they made the puck almost glow in the dark using special effects
[1:15:28] <destinction13> @fl0m NBC tried that a few years a go with a dot over it and it couldn't keep up with how fast it moved KEKW it was always just behind where it was
[1:15:35] <mukulhayaran> x0r6ztGiggle vp
[1:15:36] <silviu_cs> @Miksu2222 It was slightly T-sided last year
[1:15:42] <ImZed_> Why not make the puck physically a different color? does that change anything for the players?
[1:15:44] <kcerwniart> they dont need to make the puck glow you just need to watch a lil more hockey :)
[1:15:47] <aarvaa> @mukulhayaran BorpaFoundYou
[1:15:50] <LeBoomstickPBP> @sillypanda can confirm, campus is damn close to WBS Pens. Shit is really not expensive
[1:15:50] <mk_48> @fl0m i dont know how heavy the puck is, but you could probably put a tracker into it and let it be tracked from 20 different angles

[1:16:25] <Gour204> the puck with the sensor was like 40k back in the day, anytime it went over the glass they had to retrieve it
[1:16:26] <cranberyy> They should do sports game style put a circle under the puck carrier
[1:16:26] <merrypurse> In canada we are born with eyes that can just simply see a black puck on very white ice...
[1:16:27] <yungjin_r> make the puck the size of the curling stones :)

[2:13:29] <ShaawAU> @fl0m the 19th he can come back with negative pcr too
[2:13:32] <LowRatedHighlander> @debux let’s not
[2:13:34] <LeBoomstickPBP> @audio_noodle its what makes solo calls so much harder. asise from needing to do both roles, entertaining is a lot more difficult alone. it almost feels awkward
[2:13:34] <Konstantinovi> its so sad Robin Kool died of Ligma PepeHands
[2:13:35] <theHovnival> @mukulhayaran fl0mGasm
[2:13:35] <mrnoobofcs> i love how casters go off on their own trail during eco rounds and pauses is so funny
[2:13:35] <NikosRavia> @ccoltt yes
[2:13:38] <flames2802> i think the earliest he can come back is 19th
