[2:00:58] <mukulhayaran> woah is this a new map added to Counter Strike Global Offensive? de_dust2? ive never heard of it when did they add this map it looks really fun i think it would be really enjoyable to play for a 6th time in a day it wouldnt feel repetitive at all bombsite B seems like a cool site to push every round on the T side and the A site seems very cool because it seems like you could throw an entire 4 smokes that are completely necessary to taking the site which seems really cool i think

[3:16:33] <theHovnival> Learning a new language isn't difficult. The key is really about motivation and guidance.
[3:16:36] <IraklisMann> I think it's easier than you think. Especially if you learn fast @fl0m
[3:16:40] <silviu_cs> English is not my first language but I still find it very difficult to start learning a new one

[3:16:42] <PeepoConnoisseur> YEP I took french for 3 years in school, and I could hardly make any sense of it
[3:16:48] <adellll_> flow is from américa?
[3:16:49] <bigfani> you just gotta USE the language to learn it
[3:16:57] <MadokK> Learning languages in the US is insanely difficult.  Everything here caters to english speakers so its difficult to find someone to practice with unless you are trying to learn spanish
[3:17:04] <theHovnival> Motivation is difficult to come by as a native English speaker, as there's not a default reason to learn another language.

[3:19:13] <fr0stbb> I know but people require certificates and i cant get one if my grammar is shit so thats what i am practicing most @bigfani
[3:19:32] <IraklisMann> I am trying to learn Russian since 2019 and now I can start to understand the language
[3:19:33] <theHovnival> Learning languages is more like a sport: practice, repetition, enjoyment
[3:19:46] <doctordoctor_> what does that make me
[3:19:46] <bigfani> fr0stbb oh yeah, then thats understandable. Understanding grammar also comes with using the language on a more broad basis too

[3:21:31] <IraklisMann> @peepoconnoisseur Nobody taking seriously the learning a foreign language in school. That's the problem

[3:22:36] <skearns458> @theHovnival that's unfortunate. It kinda makes sense at 4 languages lol but maybe it helps if you find something meaningful to learning a certain language like "hey we can go visit Sweden but I can actually communicate with them" or something

[3:59:35] <budgetwaifu> Team Fl0m just hasnt looked the same since the first Silver Cast. I mean, why would they ever trade their star entry frags budgetwaifu and paapoweird, the #1 Silver IGL WookiePotamus, the people's favorite awper Huddlesworth and the excellent support player AFugy. After all the hard times and 2-0 winstreak i just cant believe Erik "fl0m" Flom (CEO of Team Fl0m) would ever trade his elite roster even after winning the first ever Silver Major

[5:04:25] <thefl1pdof> yeah its just an endless loop @MadokK
[5:04:35] <voliCS> Sad truth
[5:04:38] <Pojjy> If you dont think they do everything to maximize profits, then you on drugs
[5:04:41] <bigstavsays123> damn well thats very depressing lmao :(
[5:04:49] <KA1SR__> probably wont be seeing Source 2 for at least 3 years
[5:04:54] <Mentalstatemike> NODDERS
[5:04:56] <thefl1pdof> check my scrim stats and match stats COPIUM @Zeyzo_ https://play.esea.net/teams/8746371/stats
[5:04:58] <bigstavsays123> miss the good ole days where people care abt their game
[5:04:58] <rootbeard88> @fl0m why not just have the ranks  reflect percentile range? I feel like that would at least make people with 10k no longer feel bad about being SEM
[5:04:58] <Archangel_King> at least it doesnt result in some ass update we did ask for :smule
[5:05:04] <Krikkiter> you know it's true because we still don't have Zeus skins LUL
[5:05:05] <DirtyDan161> @MANIKcc we could ask them not to
[5:05:12] <thefl1pdof> match stats on the other team COPIUM @Zeyzo_
[5:05:16] <the_kung> Valve is a big corporation and CSGO isn't important enough for them to invest the money required to essentially "please" the community
[5:05:17] <MANIKcc> check out my embeds homie GroupJAM
[5:05:18] <SnowPirate> No that's literally how it is, honestly I look at a game like League and i can't help but think that they do kinda balance based on twitter sometimes
[5:05:20] <GreenBrains_> NODDERS
[5:05:21] <triplehomicide> I wonder what percentage of people actually pump the most money into skins, etc
[5:05:23] <PatrickPlayerOne> 69 IQ nice

[5:06:17] <MadokK> I cant stand the people that will rant and rave about anticheat like thats the ultimate solution
[5:06:19] <SnowPirate> Every game has its own set of problems, but some games problems are a lot worse than others
[5:06:23] <thefl1pdof> i perform with everyone except you @Zeyzo_ COPIUM

[5:06:57] <Pojjy> Give train for example evolving to Ancient... that took ages and data that no one wanted train to make a move
[5:07:03] <SnowPirate> Like look at Titanfall, that game is a constant crisis cause Respawn only really care about Apex
[5:07:05] <VashDaStampede1337> undeniable evidence? more like 'we'll get around to it' (2yrs later) 'oh yah isnt that a prob'
[5:07:08] <m00ki3> queuing west coast mm is so bad. 10 minute queues to play silver 5 stacks
[5:07:13] <doctordoctor_> i wonder how long the a1s will remain the way it is
[5:07:26] <jakenjoi> I think nerfing the SG and Deagle were the most recent examples of Valve changing the game based on Twitter/vocal feedback.
[5:07:31] <Zeyzo_> COPIUM cant gain elo but plays well enough to carry you

[5:08:23] <MANIKcc> exactly it's insanely easy to develop a better algorithm, just take the best players average stats.. anyone above that gets flagged for review... every game should do this imo
[5:08:23] <SnowPirate> For CS it just sucks that the community is forced to just give up the gun and use third party servers for good tick rate and less/no cheaters
[5:08:25] <praeter15> yo fl0m i heard you were in a thescore esports video
[5:08:34] <Zeyzo_> fl0m even the account that has the #1 record for MM wins queues with a 4stack of cheaters

[5:08:54] <praeter15> KA1SR__ no.
[5:08:59] <triplehomicide> love homie randomly talking about how he loves fish and pasta
[5:09:00] <fr0stbb> @pastt1me Wont be disappointed
[5:09:07] <silviu_cs> @SnowPirate The AC should be better hands down, but for 90% of the player base the tick rate is not actually an issue
[5:09:09] <a732v> I think Awp should be free once per half
[5:09:10] <KA1SR__> @praeter15 why
[5:09:14] <praeter15> awp is fine
[5:09:15] <jakenjoi> NA MM is a mess though, and hoping for Valve to adopt 128tick, source 2, better anticheat, etc. is basically a Half Life 3 level meme at this point

[5:09:49] <praeter15> whats wrong with the awp
[5:09:56] <SnowPirate> @SnowPirate @silviu_cs i mean yeah i'm nowhere near good enough to actually have a legit benefit from higher tick rates, but i imagine it can be a bit annoying for the elite tier of players

[5:10:00] <MadokK> when?
[5:10:01] <triplehomicide> Valve like money.
[5:10:06] <KA1SR__> @praeter15 It's too strong for how cheap it is
[5:10:07] <bigstavsays123> is the M4A1-S better than the AK now?
[5:10:13] <KA1SR__> @bigstavsays123 no
[5:10:14] <praeter15> how is the awp too stron
[5:10:16] <DirtyDan161> @w0rmk1ll3r he's teasing
[5:10:20] <DesiredHeadshot> true
[5:10:35] <SpixCS> @fl0m  do you ever get bored of playing csgo all the time?
[5:10:37] <LowRatedHighlander> fingies finally unthawing
[5:10:38] <MANIKcc> unfortunately the corporate side of gaming is more disconnected from the real players and not the morons who post online, more than ever
[5:10:48] <thefl1pdof> hey fl0m you smell
[5:10:52] <thefl1pdof> peepoLeaveFinger
[5:10:52] <crustydumper_> @SpixCS do you like money?
[5:10:52] <bertskii> @fl0m Hey bro nice cock.
[5:10:53] <KA1SR__> @praeter15 It's literally the best gub in the game. NAF wants it to be 6000 but im being generous
[5:10:57] <SnowPirate> I know it's a normie game but Fortnite fucking nerfed their sniper so a headshot isn't a 1 hit kill anymore and that just fucking ruins it for me (my roommates got me playing it unfortunately it's a painful experience)
[5:10:59] <crustydumper_> @SpixCS cause  fl0m does
[5:11:05] <praeter15> KA1SR__ how is it the best gun in the game
[5:11:13] <JokerLuL> id hold you fl0m peepoShy
[5:11:16] <Archangel_King> i find valorant way too damn boring
[5:11:20] <SnowPirate> if CS removed the 1shot on the awp that would fucking kill the gun, but again i'm silver 1 so take what i say with a grain of salt
[5:11:23] <silviu_cs> @SnowPirate Valve probably did the math and it's not worth the expense for such little benefit
[5:11:27] <rootbeard88> @fl0m have you tried doom eternal (nightmare)
[5:11:29] <KA1SR__> @praeter15 How is it not? its a one shot from any distance to body and head

[5:11:34] <SpixCS> @crustydumper_ but at some point its not about the money. its about enjoying what he does.
[5:11:37] <the_kung> we have 4 developers who are limited by their daddy Valve to essentially only develop things that takes little resources and will increase their revenue (like operations etc). The developers probably would do everything we wish for if they could and got the budget for it
[5:11:37] <LukeryD> @fl0m should cs have seasons in the rank system?
[5:11:38] <cmxc0> @SnowPirate would never happen
[5:11:41] <praeter15> why dont teams run 5 awps KA1SR__
[5:11:46] <SnowPirate> @SnowPirate no i 100% agree with you, need better servers and the money going into it wouldn't make it worth
[5:11:51] <DeadWeightktl> Same been playing CS since the original HL... play other games and still come back to CS.

[5:12:38] <sjoerdtheman> GeT_RiGhT D:
[5:12:43] <SnowPirate> @SnowPirate i don't think so either, but with the talk of "awp too strong" i'm kinda thinking "what if they actually did nerf it so it would only 1shot with a headshot" and as a worse player who usually goes for awp bodyshots, that would kill the gun for me
[5:12:45] <LowRatedHighlander> GeT_RiGhT Smadge
[5:12:48] <fr0stbb> I love the fact that i am a part of it
[5:12:56] <LukeryD> @fl0m should cs have seasons in the rank system?
[5:12:58] <dutchbullettv> Have u tried valorant ?
[5:13:00] <crustydumper_> @GeT_RiGhT i don't like you. mr. molly man
[5:13:01] <KA1SR__> @praeter15 Why do they always run 1? IF you had 5 awps and you lose your economy is completely broken. AWP is meta. you need 1 on your team
[5:13:10] <SnowPirate> I consider myself decent when i use the awp but i go for the body because I know my aim isn't good enough for headshots
[5:13:11] <GeT_RiGhT> !ban @crustydumper_

[5:13:26] <TheRenegadeRonin> @praeter15 they don't always run one tho, T side a lot of teams don't run one

[8:03:47] <praeter15> woah is this a new map added to Counter Strike Global Offensive? de_mirage? ive never heard of it when did they add this map it looks really fun i think it would be really enjoyable to play for a 6th time in a day it wouldnt feel repetitive at all bombsite B seems like a cool site to push every round on the T side and the A site seems very cool because it seems like you could throw an entire 4 smokes that are completely necessary to taking the site which seems really cool i think

[8:29:12] <Iuxembourg> pre-2018 cobble though
[8:29:13] <Puddin_Wing> yeah but neither of them is gonna sit back and play where partey/elneney would be next to xhaka

[8:29:56] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing it's either that or only play with xhaka back there which isn't a great idea imo
[8:30:04] <idsug5> I order three butterfly knife but only one came i got to wait until sunday to get the last two
[8:30:07] <Puddin_Wing> we've seen how that turns out
[8:30:13] <Puddin_Wing> he gets a red card 17 minutes into the game
[8:30:23] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing I was just going to say, it ends up with him not on the pitch KEKW
[8:30:36] <Puddin_Wing> he's been better in this system
[8:30:42] <Puddin_Wing> but i've been hurt too many times
[8:30:43] <Flame_Fhoenix> @McBubba03 Sadge I wish u did. The cobble they have now is ass
