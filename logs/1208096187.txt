[0:27:03] <dotalegendery2> zThrice MLADY
[0:27:13] <zThrice> dotalegendery2 MLADY
[0:27:14] <a732v> Adren to Mythic :D
[0:27:15] <adder13> @fl0m  what do you think G2 should do?
[0:27:16] <huronvalley21> @zThrice BOOM @ you
[0:27:16] <marcos_s> guardian and olof to faze?
[0:27:19] <officer_ant> Been a minute, could be really good or reeeeaaaaallly bad
[0:27:24] <SoporificPanda> i am friends with magisk, dupreeh, and zonic on duolingo and they have been grinding french lessons. EZ major for vitality
[0:27:26] <Mr_Gatler> Prolly the best move for the astralis boys but idk how it's gonna be vitality
[0:27:28] <hemgarr> Tarik and stew to mibr?
[0:27:40] <XeeVzz> apex is a major winner also Clap
[0:27:45] <officer_ant> I hope shox finds a good team soon
[0:27:46] <apoodle10> KEKW
[0:27:47] <errorCS_BM> is the free agents a viable option for complexity ?? @fl0m
[0:27:54] <Dynamo_Dave> @stewartj i'm just glad i didnt paste the political paragraph below that one KEKW
[0:27:55] <skylo_y> zywoo cant speak english properly kekw
[0:27:59] <cyanideaddict_> Peepo
[0:28:04] <ZORO1800> zonic will make it work
[0:28:04] <stormshitman> true
[0:28:06] <ScoutPack151> yeah I don't see this working out
[0:28:06] <rygaardhansen> Dupreeh and Apex are going to overlapping roles, no?
[0:28:07] <stormshitman> very true
[0:28:07] <Mr_Gatler> I feel like they can be top 10 but not major title contenders
[0:28:09] <Boyinawell> I think the expectations will be too high, so while over time it could do well, right away it wont and that will cause a collapse
[0:28:16] <carboxylate1> were there any better french players or should they have just not made a change
[0:28:22] <Arrowhead1300> first NiP, now Vitality, the danes are invading
[0:28:27] <dotalegendery2> he can speak english chat
[0:28:27] <huronvalley21> millions of viewers lol
[0:28:27] <SoporificPanda> i am feeling thank you FeelsOkayMan
[0:28:28] <dotalegendery2> he shy
[0:28:29] <stewartj> @Dynamo_Dave it was actually one of the most intelligent things i've seen on twitch LUL
[0:28:30] <a732v> that was also like 3 years ago
[0:28:31] <PabloEscoBAKED> zywoo speaks great english
[0:28:31] <M3n0H> zywoo no, haHAA
[0:28:33] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[0:28:33] <Killer_Panda2k11> Shy = can't speak KKona
[0:28:40] <ZORO1800> Zywoo has been playing FPL for years lol he definitely knows english
[0:28:50] <errorCS_BM> faze yeah
[0:28:53] <Mr_Gatler> no international roster has won a major yet
[0:28:57] <zThrice> @fl0m has there been a major winner roster where there was a language barrier?
[0:28:58] <Inversion101> I mean flom his english isnt great though, its definitely good enough for conversation but I really dont think its good enough for fast efficient comms
[0:29:04] <Mr_Gatler> but they got there lmao
[0:29:08] <rygaardhansen> NeL have reported that the 3 remaining French players speak good English
[0:29:09] <huronvalley21> @fl0m do you know the Major viewers numbers altogether? Like people attending and people specing online?!
[0:29:10] <carboxylate1> @zThrice nope
[0:29:12] <Sealer9> I would argue doing an interview in a second language in front of fans is much harder than communicating in cs in another language
[0:29:12] <ScoutPack151> and g2 just lost their coach and prob 1-2 players lol
[0:29:13] <dotalegendery2> 2nd places on major pain Sadge
[0:29:16] <AirGlider> but historically they havent won anything right?
[0:29:16] <felibelii> Probably because #1 niko is nuts and #2 he has more experience in international rosters than in national ones LUL @fl0m
[0:29:18] <XeeVzz> even if he can talk ,it will be hard
[0:29:19] <officer_ant> I think everyone comming in english keeps you from articulating properly what you mean to say. Synergy as a team takes longer to achieve
[0:29:19] <Mr_Gatler> no no, niko was good KEKW
[0:29:22] <Dynamo_Dave> @stewartj thats what you get when you have to pull things out of your ass to make the word count on essays LUL
[0:29:27] <zThrice> carboxylate1 thats what I thought

[0:29:53] <Nightbot> MLADY
[0:30:00] <Dankner> Just speak the universal language english Kappa
[0:30:15] <Sealer9> Well fl0m our favorite NA team is going international :D
[0:30:15] <Moobot> fl0m has partnered with IBUYPOWER for all of his PC needs! Check out their website here: https://ibp.gg/fl0m
[0:30:17] <need_a_name__> fnatic on a 9 match win streak and it is international
[0:30:38] <k1p_csgoo> you would have to think more when you're not talking mother language, which transmit into less of communication and aim accuracy
[0:30:38] <JakeHart> JakeHart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Almost a year and Fl0m still hasn‚Äôt showered. Pain.
[0:30:38] <Techno> - JakeHart just re-subscribed for 11 months! fl0mPog
[0:30:38] <Boyinawell> You can see the international issues when you and Davey played. The language barrier, cultural differences, his view angle
[0:30:38] <officer_ant> its not impossible for it to succeed it just takes a long time. And orgs would revamp the roster before you you can achieve it
[0:30:44] <adder13> @fl0m what do you think G2 should do?
[0:30:45] <zThrice> need_a_name__ were not talking winning matches we are talking winning tournaments
[0:30:47] <bluehipp0> I'm not sure...
[0:30:48] <javo_> @fl0m did we already discuss why nip signed es3tag and not bubzki?
[0:30:50] <Dynamo_Dave> wait... christmas emotes in chat??? BLANKIES DinkDonk
[0:30:54] <kallek> 100 ping on the comms KEKW
[0:30:56] <Dankner> @boyinawell solid comment
[0:30:57] <dweevers> the extra half second it takes you to think of how to say it in your non-native language can make a huge difference fl0m
[0:30:58] <BizarreMark> Peep So TL shox huh
[0:31:02] <stormshitman> @kallek KEKW
[0:31:03] <huronvalley21> Well who'll be IGLing for vitality?
[0:31:06] <huronvalley21> Apex?
[0:31:06] <sgpamaar> fallen prob has the best english of every international player
[0:31:07] <bluehipp0> in many sports you have great players that often have no language skills in their new team
[0:31:08] <skylo_y> @kallek LMFAAOOOOAOO
[0:31:12] <S1lentFr3ddy> What was the obo situation? I missed that
[0:31:12] <AirGlider> i'm interested to see how good zywoos english is because even a couple years ago it didnt seem that great
[0:31:14] <officer_ant> I think Faze did it well but they still dont see a ton of success as a whole
[0:31:14] <mrlp1337> Peepo
[0:31:15] <batsbanaan_> Thats true
[0:31:17] <carboxylate1> @huronvalley21 most likely
[0:31:25] <huronvalley21> hmmm
[0:31:26] <batsbanaan_> I would say for igls its even harder
[0:31:27] <stormshitman> im bilingual and the hitch always exists 100 percent
[0:31:28] <mrlp1337> winter Peepo  POGGERS
[0:31:37] <murlocnoies> can agree sometimes I forget words
[0:31:38] <ScoutPack151> yeah they still think in their native language.
[0:31:39] <BizarreMark> SHRUGGERS But Alex was good IGL
[0:31:40] <SpykerLOL> Oh yeah for sure bud
[0:31:49] <stsoul2> do you remember the vs rumour that astralis were better because danish words are shorter
[0:31:56] <ScoutPack151> @SpykerLOL speaking in canadian
[0:31:58] <officer_ant> The new vitality could be a failure or a major contender. There is no in between.
[0:31:59] <Moobot> Fl0m is now sponsored by Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs. Yes he really gets paid to eat hotdogs. Use the link below to find Nathans's Famous Hot Dogs in a store near you! bit.ly/GlizzyFl0m
[0:32:00] <yaJgnizamA> i can barely speak my native language
[0:32:04] <huronvalley21> It takes ZyWoo to tell apex to STFU
[0:32:10] <Mr_Gatler> YEP that's exactly what the hltv confirmed guys said
[0:32:11] <Destructoid5858> This is Ted Talk with NA CS:GO's Dad Flom
[0:32:13] <errorCS_BM> who would complexity potentially pick up ??
[0:32:14] <dFab1> Dupreeh and Apex multilingual malding
[0:32:17] <BizarreMark> YEP Qui qui baguette
[0:32:17] <ScoutPack151> maybe Zonic can fix apex lol
[0:32:18] <zThrice> And then there are Danes KEKW
[0:32:19] <XeeVzz> what if magisk will be the new igl
[0:32:24] <apoodle10> if apex doesn't igl, i think rpk would be a much better fit with zonic
[0:32:32] <rygaardhansen> But why does it works in Dota and LoL?
[0:32:36] <M3n0H> gla1ve smash KEKW
[0:32:42] <BizarreMark> peepoW fisting desk fl0mSlam
[0:32:44] <WookiePotamus> have a good day chat fl0mHeart
[0:32:46] <huronvalley21> gla1ve was IGL though right>?
[0:32:46] <adder13> @fl0m what do you think G2 should do?
[0:32:47] <Sealer9> Hey at least now with shox we will finally get some emotion on liquid :)
[0:32:50] <dotalegendery2> WookiePotamus u too
[0:32:52] <TrvsF> no one else on vitality is that animated tho
[0:32:53] <Dynamo_Dave> apex definitely gets his team hyped like nobody else
[0:32:53] <huronvalley21> Any Astralis news @fl0m ?
[0:32:54] <zThrice> youre not my dad @WookiePotamus
[0:32:55] <officer_ant> I think theres a good balance of tilt and overwhelming support with apeX. There must be a good balance that they can work with
[0:32:56] <jaawglaary> Cadian is the only emotional dane
[0:32:57] <apoodle10> no, YOU have a great day WookiePotamus
[0:32:57] <BizarreMark> peepoCool / wookie
[0:33:00] <stormshitman> stsoul2 Pog  havent seen you in so long
[0:33:09] <huronvalley21> LOL Cadian how many monitors?
[0:33:12] <torp3d0_> @rygaardhansen you don't need that quick and fast comms in MOBA's IMO
[0:33:15] <huronvalley21> Same with device how many monitors?
[0:33:20] <Diaz1> zoroBaller
[0:33:27] <Inversion101> you dont need fast efficient comms in league/dota the same way you do in CS
[0:33:29] <Nightbot> Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
[0:33:38] <mayor_RO> in France there are many people like apex many emotional players
[0:33:45] <javo_> MOBA's comms are much less detailed
[0:33:58] <Just_Melo> Mobas are individual lanes into teamfights/objectives you can't compare to an fps
[0:34:01] <huronvalley21> Usually 2 different IGLs too
[0:34:17] <enemyteamyasuoxd> CS requires constant call outs/ info etc. League for the most part everyone somewhat knows what is going on, you also can communicate what you‚Äôre doing via pings
[0:34:24] <huronvalley21> One claling beginning strats others telling players during roun
[0:34:27] <k1p_csgoo> the more comfortable you feel ingame the more you can get out of the game which transits into winning, speaking your mother language can make a big difference in situations like calling accuracy, or makes you have to think less and focus more on your role i'd say
[0:34:51] <officer_ant> I dont think the tilting is going to be an issue. I think its going to be more about team synergy not getting to a good level before the org wants to switch shit up again
[0:34:53] <need_a_name__> if fallen is leaving then who is joining t
[0:34:58] <need_a_name__> tl
[0:35:02] <Just_Melo> yes Chinese teams in lol
[0:35:11] <huronvalley21> @officer_ant absolutely synergy will be the issue
[0:35:11] <rygaardhansen> Thanks for answering
[0:35:12] <dreamshadow0> Liquid also in Dota
[0:35:14] <Dynamo_Dave> if someone is holding b solo on mirage. you have no idea whats happening on the rest of the map
[0:35:19] <BizarreMark> pepeMeltdown EG
[0:35:19] <stsoul2> calling out if you hear footsteps is huge
[0:35:22] <huronvalley21> I feel the Danish and French fans are not happy with this move
[0:35:25] <AirGlider> obo Sadge
[0:35:29] <zThrice> stan is washed, sad to say
[0:35:36] <ScoutPack151> I don't think EG know what is happening with EG
[0:35:40] <BizarreMark> Sadge stan
[0:35:41] <huronvalley21> Olof is done right?
[0:35:43] <enemyteamyasuoxd> NA is really the only region that imports heavy in league
[0:35:45] <zThrice> hes run out of steam
[0:35:46] <mayor_RO> bro my opinion is international rosters are the future
[0:35:48] <zThrice> get it chat
[0:35:50] <zThrice> run out of steam
[0:35:51] <karlsson365> !crosshair
[0:35:51] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's in-game settings: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY?t=426 (it's timestamped) (changed to gap -2 ; fixedgap -4 respectively)
[0:35:58] <parub1> @Flom did you hear that nitro might consider going back to csgo
[0:36:00] <BizarreMark> monkaHmm thrice
[0:36:09] <huronvalley21> Is Olofmeister done competing? @fl0m
[0:36:10] <SoporificPanda> zThrice back to giraffe facts for you
[0:36:13] <zThrice> PepeLaugh
[0:36:20] <gauravt1998> S1MPLWE
[0:36:22] <Mr_Gatler> cerq is basically NA
[0:36:24] <officer_ant> EG unfortunately will always be a mess. You think tarik will be taken back to build a decent roster or has that ship sailed?
[0:36:24] <gauravt1998> S1mplw
[0:36:29] <pinkyto3> mixwell?
[0:36:34] <gauravt1998> s1mple when he joined liquid
[0:36:48] <Dynamo_Dave> its a big commitment leaving a continent. not just a country/state
[0:36:50] <BizarreMark> NAF to EG SeriousSloth
[0:36:54] <huronvalley21> It sucks... EG like NiP long time fan since beginning of cs competition
[0:36:57] <gauravt1998> s1mple when he joined liquid he just carried them
[0:36:57] <mayor_RO> bro mixwell played really good on optic what about him
[0:36:58] <huronvalley21> like Fnatic
[0:36:59] <XeeVzz> it was a dark time in s1mple's career
[0:37:02] <mayor_RO> and jkaem too
[0:37:06] <M3n0H> maybe they dont trust obo
[0:37:06] <officer_ant> @BizarreMark NAF wont leave liquid for a while
[0:37:07] <ScoutPack151> It looked like he just gave up
[0:37:28] <mayor_RO> bro mixwell played really good on optic what about him not only michu @fl0m
[0:37:35] <TargiJuan> mizkifNote He looks Polish
[0:37:41] <cs_java> I dont want the Liquid roster to change much :( Its fine if they lose Fallen but I want the other 4 to stick together
[0:37:45] <PolynomC> Rush and Stewie joining?
[0:37:47] <AirGlider> @fl0m if EG could pick up any NA free agents who should they get?
[0:37:49] <huronvalley21> But would mixwell perform at a Major level with the comp out there now
[0:37:57] <officer_ant> I wonder if falleN leaves liquid they will take tarik and move NAF to primary AWPer again
[0:38:03] <Diaz1> do you think eg could bring tarik back?
[0:38:10] <ScoutPack151> @fl0m There was a rumour around Stew joining EG. thoughts?
[0:38:11] <BizarreMark> officer_ant Yeah I guess, maybe C9 decides to make some roster moves maybe then, but not sure?
[0:38:18] <bigfudge3432> Obo had to want to leave because that‚Äôs the only cut that didn‚Äôt make sense
[0:38:22] <pjcq> PepeLaugh

[2:37:18] <Rei_J4> homie just needs to accept that this isn't his match.  try again next match
[2:37:19] <Zeyzo_> peepoHug how doink jizz jizz
[2:37:23] <jzk777> fl0mSlam no stream delay fl0mSlam how could i possibly shoot fl0mSlam
[2:37:24] <ninetyfivemonkeys> i laugh every time a non sub tries to copypasta
[2:37:24] <bolottekid> D:
[2:37:28] <ninetyfivemonkeys> GOTTA PAY TO PLAY FOLKS
[2:37:30] <ninetyfivemonkeys> ;)
[2:37:32] <waduheckfossy> delay is for hoes KEKW
[2:37:33] <sevengaming_tv> ninetyfivemonkeys peepoGiggles
[2:37:37] <xPad_> the delay is in his brain
[2:37:38] <bolottekid> Actually

[2:37:43] <jzk777> doing good Zeyzo_ MmmHmm hbu?
[2:37:44] <KMur_Creates> i laugh every time a non sub tries to copypasta
[2:37:48] <Killer_Panda2k11> Or maybe stop being a try hard on PUGs KEKW
[2:37:51] <BrotherBeelo13> How much brain delay is he using?
[2:37:55] <dankiyy> lukewarm to say the least
[2:38:02] <frogoree> the brain delay is much worse than the stream delay this match
[2:38:03] <Dynamo_Dave> I used to be bothered by in-game rage until I bought a Kia Optima. The Kia Optima is a stylish saloon aimed at the Ford Mondeo and Volkswagen Passat. It sits proud in a segment destined for decline, offering space, kit and quality, wrapped up in a reliable Kia-branded package. If you're after an economical and good value family car, the Optima should be on your list.
[2:38:05] <ninetyfivemonkeys> @Killer_Panda2k11 faceit lvl 10 should have a bumpy brain
[2:38:07] <two_drop> @BrotherBeelo13 nice

[7:17:57] <huronvalley21> Surfing helps with movement like KZ
[7:17:59] <ayezey> @Doccy monkaHmm

[7:18:16] <apoodle10> prodigy was fun, but i didn't play it much because i couldn't be bothered to learn the maps with a more intricate layout, and prodigy was just such a maze

[7:55:28] <Doccy> restrict lootboxes
[7:55:41] <huronvalley21> that's a good option actually
[7:55:41] <Doccy> or just ban them
[7:55:45] <Doccy> fuck lootboxes tbh
[7:55:50] <huronvalley21> yeah like the skin market in CS GO
[7:56:16] <AMutantCookie> Loot boxes just make a fuck tonne of money though. They will fight it till their last breath to keep
[7:56:19] <Doccy> the fact people treat the cs skins like stock day trading
[7:56:33] <AMutantCookie> EA made what a billion dollars from just Ultimate team/
