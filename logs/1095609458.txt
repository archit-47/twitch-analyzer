[0:24:53] <Puddin_Wing> I mean, that can go for artists in any genre. Green Day put out like 15 or 20 years of great albums then started writing shite. AFI put out 2 good albums then turned into a dumpster fire. @slimrick6
[0:24:55] <c0rkmcnortis> Acid rap might still be my favorite rap album ever, but holy shit chance can’t make good music these days
