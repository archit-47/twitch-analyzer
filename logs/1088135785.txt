[4:06:05] <officialnigelg> @tarik how much did you earn in c9 after the major?

[4:54:39] <zebraoncrack> Once again, Tarik "tarik" Celik has demonstrated his mastery of the humblest of tools in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the flashbang. Every time he lines up a nade, my toes curl with anticipation of the beautiful teamplay I know lurks just around the corner. His sleek throwing motion belies the thousands of hours he's spent honing his craft across space and time. I've never seen anyone so adept at setting up his teammates. Blind me with your light tarik. What a lord.

[5:07:41] <Romit_Kanabar> @WillP0918 anything can happen its not like 100% gambit winning
[5:08:00] <d1se3t> @WillP0918 gambit will loose to navi
[5:08:10] <Sur_Cole> who plays first game chat?
[5:08:11] <greywindex> why wont esl allow costreaming smh
[5:08:12] <margiela69> Why everyone keeping glocks ct side tonight
[5:08:12] <Denn1sTheMenac3> All the pressure is on Gambit tmr
[5:08:13] <yung_kenji> I think the semi would be super dead though if FaZe won
[5:08:14] <LoksyS1> Gambit didnt look that good against G2 tbh
[5:08:18] <LoksyS1> Navi is the real favorite
[5:08:22] <WillP0918> @d1se3t but will gambit lose to faze
[5:08:28] <swatkeith> but the casters said no one is close to gambits league
[5:08:30] <WillP0918> @d1se3t I think so
[5:08:41] <Daiily> !socials
[5:08:44] <margiela69> Ppl been watching gambit demos
[5:08:44] <swatkeith> or are the casters overhyping the
[5:08:45] <singsing_13> @yung_kenji it'll actually be hype
[5:08:48] <margiela69> They are ready
[5:08:49] <d1se3t> @WillP0918 highly unlikely but anything is possiblr
[5:08:57] <yung_kenji> @swatkeith Gambit has been losing some big series to NaVi recently.
[5:08:59] <margiela69> I hate vp
[5:09:04] <1law_> vitality won against gambit
[5:09:07] <stanleywu> hopefully faze pull the upset
[5:09:10] <margiela69> No way they win tmrw
[5:09:10] <1law_> everything is possible
[5:09:16] <vigoda_> simple looks so incredible this event, that Navi are absolutely a legit chance against Gambit

[5:09:38] <margiela69> Astralis are not as washed as ppl think
[5:09:38] <ranger20fast> pistol?

[5:10:25] <yung_kenji> karrigan's calling is waaaay to dependant on player form imo. An upset is possible, but twistzz and broky needs to be insane.
[5:10:27] <wkd_tv> any titters in chat?

[5:13:53] <d1se3t> mr12 is bullshit

[5:14:02] <alcatrazantirekalma> shwz is a very toxic player tha k god he's not on your team
[5:14:02] <jprosp21> yea that’s dumb it makes csgo special
[5:14:06] <McRippins> It used to be MR12 back in the day and MR15 is so much better
[5:14:09] <yoshitta> @tepatry wait fr?
[5:14:09] <yanqeem> 1.6 had MR12
[5:14:10] <Leb0nJame> itd fuck the economy so bad tho @tarik
[5:14:13] <eggsaladplusbacon> that's fucked up
[5:14:16] <jprosp21> just changing the game to valorant Sadge
[5:14:17] <margiela69> Ruins all the stats
[5:14:19] <d1se3t> mr15 is for chads
[5:14:20] <chipotle604> losing pistol would mean gg
[5:14:22] <1vadercs> cs is literally a perfect game
[5:14:24] <cavegirl> karrigan gets a lot of hate from people who dont know the game lmaoo
[5:14:26] <allukazoldycKK> mr12 would make the economy so shit just like valorant
[5:14:29] <deciB1ll> @Temperaize when you put it this way...it does sound pretty crazy
[5:14:30] <eggsaladplusbacon> fk valorant rounds
[5:14:30] <mcamzz> I like MR15 cause it feels like there’s more comeback potential
[5:14:31] <vikkekw2> mr15 Gigachad
[5:14:34] <ssintra> games are quite long tho
[5:14:38] <Rimprex> Kids wouldn’t know that old CS was mr12 KEKW
[5:14:40] <Shotgun_Chef> mr15 only happened because they couldnt balance the money
[5:14:46] <vigoda_> should be mr 15 with Valorant OT (2 rounds in a row victory)
[5:14:47] <margiela69> Every sport is long
[5:14:49] <1law_> they care alot about viewership
[5:14:50] <sassy_nick> what is mr15?
[5:14:51] <d1se3t> mr15 is better
[5:14:56] <kazekagegaara29> no Moe today.. feels so good..
[5:14:58] <s1gmaO> MR15 just better
[5:14:59] <Leb0nJame> well they made the big economy change a couple years ago and theyd have to go back to s shittier econ
[5:15:01] <SVaneF> @sassy_nick max round

[5:15:28] <LoksyS1> @cavegirl his IGL strats consist on making a play based on him trying to do a risky play and then he dies, putting his team at disadvantage many rounds lol
[5:15:28] <cowinacow> they should make the bombs stronger so less terrorists live after it explodes
[5:15:32] <1swim> lieth wayyy too tired KEKW
[5:15:42] <Gekko125> they should change OT to 2 in a row wins instead of 6 rounds. 2 OT games can be 12 more rounds of CS
[5:15:43] <eeeeMGEEEE> lieth doesnt know whats going on anymore
[5:15:44] <ukenshi> mr3 would better win by 20
