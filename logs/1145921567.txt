[1:38:01] <STatisfacti0n> be a variety streamer and play whatever you want. good streamers gonna grow :D
[1:38:09] <killerdragon510> i felt sed when I saw people shifting to val
[1:38:13] <handsupboiii> is it going to be vitality or navi, what do you think? @fl0m
[1:38:25] <umaroreis> do you think CS will recover after the major and the LANs come ack?
[1:38:46] <th3kery> or ASMR cooperation, right @fl0m?  Kappa

[1:40:23] <Mune94> @fl0m have you seen an italian team? lmao try imagiine why
[1:40:33] <handsupboiii> griefing
[1:40:39] <n0r13k> I think CS has huge cultural power in EU, whereas NA tends to be a little less "loyal"
[1:40:45] <Mune94> @fl0m btw I am italian, I am not dissing
[1:40:49] <Justhoohaa> I swear. Everytime someone mentions cs being dead I have to hear fl0m talk logically
[1:40:54] <Donnigan> after 15 years of cs i haven't found another comp fps game that can keep my attention

[1:41:50] <HorseS0da> I don't think Valorant will ever match the level of fun as it was playing with you, that's TRUE marketing right there
[1:41:52] <Nomad182> play what you wanna play peepoRiot
[1:41:52] <killerdragon510> there is no satisfaction in valo

[1:42:17] <xfluzsk> hey fl0m
[1:42:25] <n0r13k> I really like how Party Astronauts play Inferno.
[1:42:27] <Solank0> Anyone tried Vampire: the masquerade bloodhunt yet?
[1:42:31] <w0liver> i just think valorant is so boring.. the play feels so slow and the corners are 4 miles deep lmfao
[1:42:34] <handsupboiii> the only time cs dies is when another cs releases
[1:42:46] <STatisfacti0n> I mean not all of the casual player base watches the professional matches so what you see in terms of viewership absolutely doesn't indicate how alive a game is
[1:42:47] <lasmole101> there is the argument that should NA viewership dwindle then sponsorship money may go with it due to biggest advertisement contracts come from the US
[1:42:49] <Aralain> CS is a special kind of addiction, I always come back to it
[1:42:49] <apodis10> i'm amazed that commercials work on anyone
[1:42:53] <TheLuffLuff> people like to be aknowledged as someone good at things so popular competitive games gain players from this
[1:42:55] <yakikurwa> i will agree that we wanted new maps for cs but they give us ancient and its huge sad
[1:42:55] <killerdragon510> the stage for vct is so wonderful , hope esl will do the same
[1:42:56] <ksoltan> !viewmodel
[1:42:57] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's in-game settings including his viewmodel: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY?t=367
[1:43:10] <Nomad182> @yakikurwa but ancient is dope
[1:43:19] <n0r13k> Ancient is a very good map.
[1:43:32] <NanosymBol> what pro player do you like watching the most with only a deagle and a dream?
[1:43:37] <yakikurwa> for a pug maybe. played it in a match and it was no good if you ask me? feels random as fuck
[1:43:39] <killerdragon510> the stage for vct is so wonderful , hope esl will do the same
[1:43:43] <STatisfacti0n> the sponsorships were also chasing the zeitgeist
[1:43:46] <Aralain> NA companies still want EU and CH customers
[1:43:48] <STatisfacti0n> they always will
[1:43:55] <STatisfacti0n> as long as they can make a profit, that's what companies and orgs will do
[1:44:04] <lex_luthra> a lot of NA cs orgs r going to EU right?
[1:44:08] <4NG0S> bloated as in not enough talent?
[1:44:19] <STatisfacti0n> bloated as in way more than there should be
[1:44:38] <ashu9890> !settings
[1:44:38] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's ingame settings: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY
[1:44:41] <n0r13k> There's no T2 scene in VALORANT, a lot of people are going to be very disappointed.
[1:44:43] <STatisfacti0n> a lot of half-baked orgs existing just solely to have their name in the mix of it all, hoping to also make money while it's big
[1:44:49] <HorseS0da> Chat you should listen to him, and if you didn't know he's HARDSTUCK DIAMOND
[1:44:51] <killerdragon510> cs will never die , as long as we have people like you , who really enjoy this game 🎯
[1:44:57] <umaroreis> I mean the NA scene can function without a huge NA playerbase, if you catch my drift. The NA LCS in league is like half asians and europeans but there are a lot of sponsors because of franchised leagues etc
[1:45:06] <4NG0S> Ahh fair
[1:45:16] <yakikurwa> what he just said is facts there need to be less teams na
[1:45:45] <n0r13k> @umaroreis franchised leagues are awful, as a European the entire idea of it is bewildering.
[1:45:54] <LonsoR> its like overwatch... it sucks
[1:45:55] <4NG0S> Its like the cfl needing 3 canadians on each team lol
[1:46:00] <STatisfacti0n> the only downside to the shrinking of the NA scene is there's is only a few teams that are at that "professional" level now
[1:46:10] <senorvac12> just buy all the talent KKona
[1:46:10] <umaroreis> yeah they are awful when it comes to competition, open circuit is 100% better but franchises are better for orgs, I guess
[1:46:17] <killerdragon510> and dmg in cs but I suck at valo
[1:46:19] <w0liver> the problem is that NA players think Valorant is big WORLDWIDE, when it is literally just half of washed NA CS pros lmao
[1:46:23] <yakikurwa> we dont need a lot of teams we just need one good team
[1:46:40] <LonsoR> franchising = entry barriers to protect incumbent teams
[1:46:50] <n0r13k> NA molly
[1:46:51] <t4urtus> NA molly
[1:46:56] <BizarreMark> NA Molly

[1:47:09] <yaJgnizamA> evening gamers

[1:47:38] <umaroreis> like orgs like EG going EU and 100t picking renegades before etc
[1:47:38] <LonsoR> the good thing about valorant is that it runs on a potato so many players in emerging markets can play it
[1:47:38] <priiide_> senorvac12 NA is mostly console players
[1:47:51] <w0liver> but worldwide, its really not that big. the Valo hype train is great but its not big in other regions lmao
[1:47:53] <n0r13k> You was CSS wasn't you?
[1:47:57] <senorvac12> i see in COD and other scenes?
[1:48:07] <lex_luthra> so is csgo 2 going to be the next thing?
[1:48:07] <nora2way> I don't think Valorant playerbase is bigger than CSGO's
[1:48:12] <killerdragon510> did u get satisfaction while playing valorant?
[1:48:14] <w0liver> @senorvac12 absolutely not lmao
[1:48:35] <STatisfacti0n> he didn't get STatisfacti0n Sadge
[1:48:43] <BizarreMark> Sadge Stat
[1:48:43] <Solank0> Source warcraft servers were fun
[1:48:44] <killerdragon510> indeed
[1:48:45] <senorvac12> i thought he asked abot STatisfacti0n
[1:48:45] <Scape000> COULD NOT AGREE MORE
[1:48:54] <90tino> 100%
[1:48:57] <Scape000> @fl0m why u hate solo que
[1:48:57] <priiide_> i have less fun playing solo queue valorant than cs and im significantly better at valorant
[1:48:58] <n0r13k> Personally, I really dislike VALORANT - but that's probably down to the fact that a) in EU it's a library and I function off comms and b) I hate the retake meta.
[1:49:03] <STatisfacti0n> brb getting food
[1:49:07] <Scape000> @fl0m I hate solo too, but why do u dislike
[1:49:18] <cschopps> sick shirt :)
[1:49:18] <senorvac12> because of no comms or? @fl0m
[1:49:32] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m solo queuing CS is dogshit too though tbf
[1:49:33] <asdfk1> ive never even played valorant, no interest
[1:49:35] <Nomad182> @senorvac12 he had some super weirdos, trolls
[1:49:42] <ReBorn_StyLez> Hey fl0m idk if anyone told you this as of late / / / / nice cock
[1:49:50] <umaroreis> i'd play valorant but i feel bad supporting a company like riot
[1:49:53] <killerdragon510> we don't play compi , we have a squad of 20 people , they get free time in weekend, we enjoy in casual,so fun
[1:49:55] <umaroreis> same as overwatch

[1:50:33] <STatisfacti0n> okay I get food now
[1:50:36] <LonsoR> my last faceit game ended up 3 v 5...
[1:50:39] <senorvac12> is faceit Valo a thing thats possible?
[1:50:44] <w0liver> valorant feels like CS as a mobile game, but still on PC
[1:50:50] <Holstaura> it's the overwatch effect after they made role lock.
[1:51:00] <Nomad182> @senorvac12 NOPERS they refuse to work with 3rd party integrations
[1:51:03] <LonsoR> @senorvac12 nah, riot wants to control the entire value chain
[1:51:05] <w0liver> i'm glad people like it though, i don't wanna hate on it i just don't get it lol
[1:51:08] <Holstaura> some roles just can't do anything to carry uncoopoerative people
[1:51:10] <n0r13k> The best parts of comp VALORANT are the bits that feel like CS.

[3:25:54] <ThatOtherGuy122> At Twitch I was so surprised to see Fl0m. He was ignoring all subs one by one. The subs were unfazed, this was a daily occurrence according to them. Every time he ignored one he said something about “5 gifted” under his breath.

[3:26:00] <praeter15> bhopping IRL is a scary visual

[3:50:31] <yourducky> it works
[3:50:33] <JalapenoJeppe> a moose wtf
[3:50:35] <yourducky> but doesnt print happy bday
[3:50:41] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky the other issue you have is current is the current year and DOB I'd assume will be a different year
[3:50:47] <yourducky> YEP
[3:50:51] <yourducky> hang on
[3:50:54] <Solank0> Canadian moose?
[3:50:59] <angymilo> like the ones from canada?

[3:51:10] <Puddin_Wing> project pat?
[3:51:16] <Nomad182> @yourducky wait - I could be very wrong, but current can never equal DOB, right? it'd have to be current_month and current_day = bday_month and bday_day ?

[3:52:22] <STatisfacti0n> Current will always be the current year (2021) while DOB will have another year. so yeah, Current will NEVER equal DOB
[3:52:24] <Nomad182> @STatisfacti0n yeah I'm just slow, but I think we're onto something rooHi
[3:52:25] <STatisfacti0n> unless they are born today
[3:52:27] <Booooooolin> munchy sub sound YEP
[3:52:36] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky set the DOB to today's date
[3:52:39] <STatisfacti0n> and see if it prints
[3:52:49] <Puddin_Wing> project pat is great, I fuckin love some of 3 6 mafia's work
[3:52:53] <yourducky> NOPERS
[3:52:57] <yourducky> didnt do anything
[3:53:11] <njblumberg> munchy is a pycho and i love it
[3:53:15] <yourducky> wait
[3:53:17] <yourducky> it worked
[3:53:20] <yourducky> titties
[3:53:25] <Puddin_Wing> the fact that all his shit is project pat is super on brand though
[3:53:28] <Puddin_Wing> I love munchy
[3:53:40] <STatisfacti0n> setting DOB to today's date worked?
[3:53:55] <yourducky> https://gyazo.com/618a3b7090e829fae35f6b8866d90ac9
[3:53:55] <cardboardtoast> object comparison
[3:53:59] <yourducky> YEP worked
[3:54:09] <messyhair> peepoClap
[3:54:12] <STatisfacti0n> yup
[3:54:19] <praeter15> yourducky does it work with any year
[3:54:27] <Puddin_Wing> as long as that year is 2021
[3:54:27] <STatisfacti0n> so just add another variable that only looks for day and month
[3:54:28] <Puddin_Wing> then yes
[3:54:29] <cardboardtoast> in languages I use at least you cannot use "==" when comparing date objects, you have to use something like .equals()
[3:54:36] <EricBantona> show close up of your pc
[3:54:50] <praeter15> Booooooolin
[3:54:52] <STatisfacti0n> and use a comparison of like if bday_monthyear == today
[3:54:57] <Booooooolin> praeter15
[3:55:04] <cardboardtoast> so the "today" = DOB works because the dates are the same @yourducky
[3:55:05] <yourducky> so I would do
[3:55:05] <praeter15> the game
[3:55:05] <Puddin_Wing> "it doesnt really go that far, man" Is the name of fl0m's autobiography
[3:55:08] <Puddin_Wing> because his weiner is small
[3:55:10] <Puddin_Wing> get it
[3:55:15] <priiide_> yes

[3:55:26] <imbakinacake> thanks for the gifted subirino
[3:55:27] <420Enigma> NODDERS
[3:55:27] <praeter15> nice one feeny
[3:55:28] <yourducky> if bday_month and bday_day == today
[3:55:32] <STatisfacti0n> you can use == for python as long as the two are the same type of variable. so both would have to be integers, strings, etc.
[3:55:33] <Puddin_Wing> ty
[3:55:52] <praeter15> what even is pythons and operator
[3:55:55] <cardboardtoast> @STatisfacti0n ah ok, that makes it easier than others :D
[3:56:00] <Puddin_Wing> Sorry fl0m sometimes the all time great classic roasts just pour out of me
[3:56:01] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky using an and in your IF statement means both have to be the same
[3:56:05] <Puddin_Wing> I can't really stem that flow
[3:56:20] <yourducky> now im confused
[3:56:21] <bilbobaginss5> you playin cs anytime soon?
[3:56:23] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky can run into trouble
[3:56:31] <datkidaa> Lex is afk
[3:56:32] <astrononymous> its disgusting behavior to talk shit about someones cock size
[3:56:34] <praeter15> yourducky add the space again see if it breaks peepoSit

[3:56:50] <angymilo> @bilbobaginss5 yeah fl0m when you gonna play cs again its like u quit

[3:56:54] <Puddin_Wing> problem?
[3:56:54] <Kafkii> Im also leaving since youre not playing bloons peepoLeaveFinger
[3:56:56] <datkidaa> F
[3:57:13] <STatisfacti0n> typically with python if you have an IF AND statement, then both pieces of the if statement have to equal whatever it is you're setting them to @yourducky. so in this case, IF bday_month AND bday_day == today, typically it means that both month and day have to be the same as today or else it will be false
[3:57:19] <datkidaa> !shutupMilo
[3:57:25] <angymilo> :)
[3:57:34] <entea> how do bears hold the news if they don't have thumbs

[3:58:30] <Puddin_Wing> DONUT
[3:58:36] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky no because each variable only has one part when today has both parts
[3:58:41] <praeter15> yourducky is this your first coding language
[3:58:45] <yourducky> yeah
[3:58:46] <yourducky> KEKW

[3:59:23] <LlamaSalamy> oh shit
[3:59:24] <LlamaSalamy> he back
[3:59:25] <Zorik13> @yourducky i dont know python syntax. statement should be right you need to find a way to write it down
[3:59:26] <praeter15> yourducky did you run it after removing line 27 cuz i think the the ifs have to be touching
[3:59:30] <LlamaSalamy> hey fl0m MLADY
[3:59:35] <LlamaSalamy> hey chat MLADY
[3:59:37] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky so you're better off setting a new variable like today = datetime.datetime(current_month,current_day) and then bday = datetime.datetime(bday_month, bday_day)
[3:59:38] <JalapenoJeppe> game do a lil troll :tf:
[3:59:47] <datkidaa> shot a 103 in golf today but they had just punched the greens.. does that count or should I disregard chat?
[3:59:51] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky or something similar to that
[3:59:56] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky and then using those in your IF statement
[4:00:10] <praeter15> didn’t he do that stat
[4:00:14] <STatisfacti0n> no

[4:02:00] <cardboardtoast> can datetime cause issues here? it runs the risk of a difference in seconds that could cause intermittent comparison fails @STatisfacti0n
[4:02:06] <datkidaa> wingman, they were probably cheating lets be honest
[4:02:07] <gboyc> why ur guy looks like if chuck norris and twitch had a baby

[4:02:33] <SukksGaming> playing wingman, only using shotgun
[4:02:35] <STatisfacti0n> @cardboardtoast I mean I think the way he's using it he'll be fine. it should really only matter if he was including seconds/minutes/hours I believe
[4:02:35] <Dashie_ttv> they played a wingman game on train, and only used shotguns
[4:02:38] <cardboardtoast> @praeter15 does python not fill it in when creating the object?
[4:02:43] <SukksGaming> They used AWP and shit, actualy cheating
[4:02:43] <yourducky> it broke stat
[4:02:44] <yourducky> KEKW
[4:02:46] <STatisfacti0n> KEKW

[4:03:40] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky okay
[4:03:48] <yourducky> fl0m we are being HACKERMANS in chat right now
[4:03:50] <cardboardtoast> lol
[4:03:52] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky so you still have to include your variables that you had before (Current and DOB)
[4:04:01] <yourducky> titties
[4:04:03] <STatisfacti0n> you just write the two new variables like you have now
[4:04:04] <yourducky> I'm stupid
[4:04:06] <STatisfacti0n> lol
[4:04:12] <STatisfacti0n> that's why it broke, because it's calling on those and you don't have them defined
[4:04:33] <yourducky> it broke still KEKWait
[4:04:43] <gboyc> BLELELE too big
[4:04:48] <STatisfacti0n> one sec
[4:04:54] <praeter15> wtf does putting the numbers into datetime() do

[4:05:52] <STatisfacti0n> @yourducky okay try rewriting birthday as birthday = datetime.datetime( ,bday_month,bday_day)
[4:05:55] <Zorik13> @STatisfacti0n he just needs third argument in datetime.datetime
[4:06:00] <STatisfacti0n> and the same for today, have a space in the first column

[4:06:14] <mamaluigi45> phalanx is really good against synths not so much xenos
[4:06:15] <STatisfacti0n> see if it throws a fit about a space instead of having an actual year

[4:06:35] <Zorik13> 0 or something
