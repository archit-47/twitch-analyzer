[0:30:54] <xjawzie> you want tohave multicore rendering enabled nessa
[0:31:12] <xjawzie> is your cs lagging or only streamlabs?

[0:34:10] <dotalegendery2> :)
[0:34:20] <Mikkel1591> Cba dota
[0:34:37] <phineasdiketer> multicore rendering should be better for sure in terms of csgo performance. Oh and ancient is worse than other maps in terms of performance too
[0:34:37] <Nightbot> Join my discord to meme and derp around! https://discord.gg/mdesYhX
[0:34:53] <dotalegendery2> cba Mikkel
[0:34:57] <phineasdiketer> you should try to add this in the steam CSGO launch arguments: +cl_forcepreload 1
[0:35:09] <phineasdiketer> it preloads assets like sounds, models, etc
[0:35:11] <sr_dub> hi
[0:35:23] <sr_dub> vanessaFood
[0:36:35] <phineasdiketer> and maybe try to add this too, some people say it boosts performance (something related to opengl): -r_emulate_g

[0:37:09] <urlilase1> the thing is that she play 1080p and the map is more heavy on the GPU add to that its 1080p is might be too much
[0:37:34] <Blazicen7> why do ppl play cs on full hd
[0:37:41] <Nightbot> Follow my twitter! https://twitter.com/NessaCSGO
[0:37:57] <phineasdiketer> Ancient is heavier than other maps in general
[0:38:03] <dotalegendery2> @Blazicen7 its personal prefrence
[0:38:31] <phineasdiketer> same, I also play on full hd, I like the HUD and stuff to be clean and high quality

[0:39:53] <sarpado_nk> Hi Nessa good morning How are you ?
[0:39:56] <phineasdiketer> Nessa, try to add this to the steam CSGO launch arguments without the quotes (the first one is an overall good one, the second one is just more of a trial and error): "+cl_forcepreload 1 -r_emulate_g"
