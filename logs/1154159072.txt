[2:08:37] <SuperTuscan888> sleeeeppyyyy It's alright, I don't mind it. One of those that will most likely grow on me. The front end looks like the controversial point, but it's way better than the silverado imo
[2:08:38] <damnw0w> How hard can be to buy the rights for tuscan ? @fl0m
[2:08:39] <xremmyxcsgo> what would you change to train so it can come back to competitive play

[2:14:03] <NERVg> that actually doesnt seem possible
[2:14:05] <dankiyy> KEKW
[2:14:05] <Gatherbro> they should just use pistols then
[2:14:05] <praeter15> so its the opposite of mythic peepoSit
[2:14:06] <Speedrulez> soooo why do they buy guns
[2:14:07] <abhi007bond> %? no cumback
[2:14:07] <Nightbot> Joris says 67%
[2:14:08] <SupraUK_> so what you're saying is... they should pistol every round
[2:14:08] <bigfani> sheesh
[2:14:08] <Nightbot> bigfani has been bant BOP
[2:14:09] <awshuckz> it's the ol 80/20 moral conundrum
[2:14:10] <nuke_cs> so mythic to mibr when?
[2:14:16] <Expanses__> How does G2 gets slapped by mibr with a standin :(
[2:14:18] <tamelike147> anyone know the name of that italian map that had hostage rescue in 1.6 ??

[2:14:38] <TheSolaceXD> this match is pretty much fpl so losing 2nd round is guaranteed pretty much
[2:14:48] <MrRobbin_> hello hi hey
[2:14:48] <NERVg> That makes sense' I'd instinctively think the opposite
[2:14:48] <praeter15> mibr gets eco'd here peepoSit

[2:14:51] <edgyeddy233> lack of experience
[2:14:57] <dankiyy> like 70-80 yeah

[2:15:10] <blacktron1x> @tamelike147 italy?
[2:15:11] <ByakkoGTV> @fl0m tell them to start throwing pistol rounds and then they can win maps. Smart.
[2:15:15] <From_The_Wrath> morning fl0m  hows it goin

[3:55:39] <goldenlogic23> @1downbad imagine csgo tomahawk free for all.
[3:55:42] <small_tymer> a new map set would be key. it is hard to get new players in when people have been playing the same maps for 20 years and now all of the lineups
[3:55:43] <ItsJustHenry> volvo
[3:55:45] <dylants> imagine if valve didn't own steam and they actually had to make games

[3:55:48] <dylants> what a world that would be
[3:55:51] <OGWerp> I would want them to do a Fan Funded Major to see how it compares to TI

[3:56:14] <damnw0w> there not going to kill something that makes them that kind of money to take a gamble
[3:56:18] <WubbiSubbi> i feel like valve has a solid vr future, but not with just general pc games

[3:56:21] <Otschboh> Beat Saber NODDERS @fl0m
[3:56:22] <chickenuggetz2> BRO?

[3:57:06] <zoody_tv> I know you said you don't care, but if a new cs came out do you think they would have skins transfer or start fresh? @fl0m
[3:57:11] <abhi007bond> %? just scout and deagle
[3:57:11] <Nightbot> Joris says 4%
[3:57:13] <siiiif> he likes playing in the dungeon NODDERS

[3:57:22] <Sergeantdude_rl> lnz kind of beaned that. if he had his gun out it was an ez kill
[3:57:26] <Darra5> He needs to scout some better players for the team Kappa
[3:57:33] <Speedrulez> he could go to mouz, but that seems like a sideway move
[3:57:36] <Speedrulez> not up or down
[3:57:37] <dankiyy> as if valve gives a fuck
[3:57:37] <jockst3r> they could just transfer the skins
[3:57:40] <Terie54> Yeah, but I think he'd be sick for Mouz

[3:58:02] <mukulhayaran> I would love to look at my safari mesh in source 2
[3:58:03] <SupraUK_> they'll keep adding to/updating CS:GO
[3:58:04] <friendlymackerel> rez is goin off a little bit
[3:58:05] <PerhapsItsPeach> valve don't give a shit about skins,  they know just like we do that people would buy new skins
[3:58:10] <SupraUK_> til the end of time
[3:58:11] <priiide_> i think especially with howl it might be hard to just transfer for legal shit
[3:58:11] <siiiif> sleeeeppyyyy D:
[3:58:16] <chickenuggetz2> amogus?
[3:58:16] <Rossaroni> they should change skins to just unlockable patterns and customizable weapons for yourself
[3:58:20] <chickenuggetz2> oh that trade
[3:58:24] <c0rkmcnortis> it would not make me want to buy another knife if this one just goes worthless

[3:58:35] <Paroto7> when was the last update for cs ?
[3:58:35] <dankiyy> that would be dope
[3:58:36] <LucidR9> the amount of inflation
[3:58:36] <ra1n1ngdeath> people will die
[3:58:36] <Solank0> People would bitch and moan but still buy new skins
[3:58:37] <zoofuu_> Didn’t know xantares started his own team
[3:58:37] <sloveCS> that would be pretty sick
[3:58:38] <LucidR9> that would cause
[3:58:38] <arkzenx> PogChamp
[3:58:41] <SupraUK_> my worm god will go 📈
[3:58:42] <friendlymackerel> @Rossaroni they would lose so much money

[3:58:42] <LowRatedHighlander> Bad sleepy
[3:58:48] <dylants> SupraUK_ i heard thats what they want to do but theres just no one that fully understands the code and thus they cant bring csgo to source 2
[3:58:51] <sloveCS> WE'D ALL BE RICH
[3:58:52] <WubbiSubbi> %? BIG comeback
[3:58:58] <siiiif> LowRatedHighlander peepoHuggers
[3:59:01] <Killer_Panda2k11> IBP and Titan Holos would double
[3:59:04] <c0rkmcnortis> fl0m why does no one seem to realize that the muliple lane tactical maps with more than a 3 lane was introduced by val csgo branded that as anicent as a way to bring the bae of valorant players back to cs which is a game that is stale
[3:59:04] <mayhem_666_> @fl0m when h1z1 became 2 separate games they put your skins on both
[3:59:05] <SupraUK_> @dylants ye, something about spaghetti code
[3:59:05] <TheSolaceXD> IBP holo sticker contraband for 1 mil each
[3:59:06] <LowRatedHighlander> My sand dunes will be worth so much
[3:59:09] <timthetrollmantaylor> Investing in a Dlore now just incase
[3:59:13] <dankiyy> im buying back my skins peepoFoil
[3:59:16] <SwifferWetWiener> csgo 2, valve outsources cs to ubisoft and ea for extra ingame transactions and bugs
[3:59:18] <SupraUK_> oh
[3:59:24] <DeFreggle> how to stream streched with streamlabs??
[3:59:24] <dylants> csgo has a really bad case of spaghetti code lmao
[3:59:25] <SupraUK_> fl0m is saying it because of how many skins he has
[3:59:26] <jannewow> I wish m4 was like it was in 1.6/source but valve will never remake it like it was because of skins D:
[3:59:26] <SupraUK_> i get iot
[3:59:26] <LucidR9> the guy with 10,000 sand dunes in his inventory hearing abour the skins no longer dropping in the new game Pog
[3:59:27] <billballbowl> I think one of the reasons they haven't released a new one has to do with potential issues around the skin market. Like if they render them void/contraband, they would probably susceptible to legal damages
[3:59:27] <a_HamHawk> I think the next dynamic item they should add to CS is a tank for 16k
[3:59:27] <DeFreggle> it doesnt work
[3:59:30] <ItsJustHenry> @fl0m Is there info about on how much volvo make per year from case sales etc?
[3:59:30] <NextDoorGuy> if that happens they would make the skins not tradeable 100%
[3:59:31] <SupraUK_> retirement fund, buddy?
[3:59:34] <NextDoorGuy> only steam market
[3:59:35] <zoofuu_> Stonks
[3:59:35] <timthetrollmantaylor> CSGO skins are just NFTs
[3:59:36] <siiiif> why are people acting like your skins would lose value? Just print them out and save them lol 4Head
[3:59:37] <njgyaani> do u know zipel @fl0m
[3:59:44] <RummYY> would suck for me cause I sold all my skins lol
[3:59:50] <splitsky_> or the skins worth nothing and the world implodes KEKW
[3:59:51] <need_a_name__> 2nd map?
[3:59:53] <dankiyy> steammarket makes a trillion or smth
[3:59:54] <dylants> a lot
[3:59:56] <TheSolaceXD> a lot
[4:00:00] <RobertCamposs> they would make it not tradable skins
[4:00:04] <SupraUK_> @dankiyy KEKW
[4:00:05] <abhi007bond> %? 2-0 ResidentSleeper
[4:00:06] <Nightbot> Joris says 1%
[4:00:09] <Lia_de> I have such a hard time understanding why I'd care if a pixel was purple or green. Skins were not made for me for sure
[4:00:09] <Solank0> Big dick move would be to make then untradeable also KEKW
[4:00:10] <c0rkmcnortis> fl0m why does no one seem to realize that the muliple lane tactical maps with more than a 3 lane was introduced by val csgo branded that as anicent as a way to bring the bae of valorant players back to cs which is a game that is stale
[4:00:12] <1downbad> valve arent publicy traded so i think getting numbers is hard

[4:00:17] <MrKrakens> big .. nip, you like?
[4:00:18] <RealMajd> Valve doesn’t control the prices, so if the skins lost their value after a new game is released, it’s not valve’s fault

[4:05:15] <maxbax0808> A "decoy decoy", so  a flash that first looks like a decoy, but then after a few seconds goes off
[4:05:16] <LucidR9> or a non clearable one
[4:05:19] <dankiyy> whoever shows up will win
[4:05:20] <palindrome____> @RummYY nouce
[4:05:24] <zoofuu_> When a person dies their knife and gloves should fall so I can be rich for a round :)
[4:05:29] <ItsJustHenry> I like the idea of a gas grenade but then I feel its too similar to a molotov
[4:05:31] <stan0728> they can bring back slap feature fromm 1.6
[4:05:38] <Terie54> add prone to cs KEKW
[4:05:40] <LucidR9> bring back the snowballs
[4:05:41] <LucidR9> KEKW

[4:05:56] <praeter15> LucidR9 weird
[4:05:59] <Solank0> Bring back nightvision KEKW
[4:06:04] <LucidR9> weird my balls

[4:06:24] <dankiyy> progression wise in the game the meta hasnt changed at all
[4:06:24] <NERVg> From the lan its not even post plant, its a heavy retake meta
[4:06:27] <ekstral0ve> do you think they would rework the damage/kill/flashed enemy animations?
[4:06:28] <flyguy1449> I think thats been created by the maps
[4:06:30] <stan0728> how bout nunchucks
[4:06:32] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Weirdest Santa Mod in Red Dead Online - https://youtu.be/6RNFJEHXWpM

[4:06:36] <NERVg> Gambit won off of just throwing all their shit on retakes
[4:06:36] <Justhoohaa> what about throwing your knife fl0m LOL
[4:06:36] <azolaki> oh a dart like sova's that only one player gets one time per round
[4:06:37] <zoofuu_> Bring back flashlights peepoRiot
[4:06:38] <SwifferWetWiener> maybe a proper proximity chat?
[4:06:38] <Phi0_> emp grenade, makes it so bomb can't be planted xD
[4:06:39] <DavieWhy> @fl0m Variable flashes, motion sensors, tear gas (you make noise if you walk through it)
[4:06:44] <fedl1ngen> Footsteps decoy like in BR would be lit.
[4:06:45] <Deagent9> how about fixing  the smoke glitch first xD
[4:06:45] <LucidR9> tomahawk fl0m - tomahawk NODDERS
[4:06:46] <dankiyy> like a teargas?
[4:06:47] <SupraUK_> VX poison  gas
[4:06:48] <djues333> @fl0m viper v2 monkaW
[4:06:49] <dylants> that's probably the best you'll get
[4:06:49] <friendlymackerel> thats just a molly that blocks vision
[4:06:50] <Squach509> NIP throw this away? pausechamp
[4:06:51] <SDPeeks> what about different types of current util, short fuse flash, longer burning molly, or a environmental nade. Like emp to knock out lights and bring back nightvision
[4:06:52] <DavieWhy> Tear gas
[4:06:55] <bigdaddydave1> gravity gun from half life. throw nades back with it
[4:06:55] <s7ytv> tabun gas type beat
[4:06:56] <Speedrulez> dj nerd
[4:06:57] <RummYY> what if they just removed mollys again?
[4:07:01] <LowRatedHighlander> An ability where you fart Peepo
[4:07:01] <wxstfall> nah semtex plays different than reg grenade
[4:07:01] <stan0728> makes the player dizzy
[4:07:03] <Rossaroni> a gas grenade could have a higher vertical element to balance with molotovs
[4:07:03] <TheMajesticGhost> 7 second poison grenade sounds fire
[4:07:04] <djues333> @Speedrulez no u
[4:07:06] <RummYY> instead of adding, removing stuff
[4:07:06] <jockst3r> if smoke is 18 sec make the gas like 12 sec but does dmg?
[4:07:07] <shagy_91> but you can hold your breath for 18 seconds
[4:07:07] <MrRobbin_> ye like i say poison grande
[4:07:07] <Floofys> What if tear gas was a CT only nade, and Ts had like. Napalm.
[4:07:07] <clastonz> de_assault where the bomb is already planted and the cts have the round to defuse
[4:07:08] <LucidR9> hehe stinky fart Peepo
[4:07:09] <njgyaani> have u ever considered podcast between a pro cs player v pro valo player luv ur podcast though@
[4:07:10] <solopistolo> pls fix the molotov bug
[4:07:11] <njgyaani> @fl0m
[4:07:11] <Otschboh> @fl0m And you get a "dot" on you when you pass through.
[4:07:12] <jackx14> i cant see shit through mollies anyway LUL
[4:07:12] <Speedrulez> dj both nerd fl0mSlam
[4:07:12] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m what about sun glasses? reduce the amount of time a flash full blinds you fl0mHmm
[4:07:12] <Beecky_not_Becky> maybe a killjoy type molly, that you can trigger from a distance
[4:07:17] <caffeinetx> i want a wirecut feature for bomb defuse
[4:07:17] <ItsJustHenry> Isnt that the same as a molotov though @fl0m where its a shorter duration than a smoke and is an area clearer type of util
[4:07:17] <wattkins> add odd job hat
[4:07:18] <lespauls19> heck yea let's add mustard gas to cs LUL
[4:07:18] <TheSolaceXD> remove molotovs NODDERS
[4:07:18] <Kraftfull> @fl0m just a smoke that makes the player cough? so they make a sound tryin to hide in it?
[4:07:19] <Torschden> a smoke you can look into but not look out of
[4:07:19] <caffeinetx> KEKW]
[4:07:20] <praeter15> sounds like viper fl0m peepoSit
[4:07:21] <djues333> @Speedrulez NODDERS
[4:07:22] <Deagent9> what about being able to buy multiples of HE, smoke, or molly  but it costs more (still hold 4)
[4:07:22] <Morde24> would you get an extra grenade slot for it?
[4:07:22] <dylants> replace the damage with a tear gas type of thing maybe?
[4:07:22] <SupraUK_> fl0m hear me out, what about a molotov which can't be extinguished by a smoke
[4:07:23] <Justhoohaa> like the viper smoke
[4:07:24] <dankiyy> add decay and vulnerability for x2 dmg too smileW
[4:07:26] <Nightbot> Latest video: What the Voice Comms during a DreamHack CS:GO Tournament Sounds Like! - https://youtu.be/OSlVtFo9bcw
[4:07:26] <Speedrulez> djues333, Peepo Kissahomie
[4:07:27] <small_tymer> coughing sound cue for info
[4:07:27] <ra1n1ngdeath> I personally would want a net to catch chickens
[4:07:29] <jockst3r> You can make it so you can only use smoke or the gas
[4:07:31] <Paroto7> one thing i miss from CS when i play valorant is spawns . i like having an edge if i understand timing depending on the spawn i get
[4:07:31] <DavieWhy> 15 dmg but makes noise as you sit in it
[4:07:34] <LucidR9> LowRatedHighlander fart ability causes sound queue Peepo
[4:07:35] <1downbad> like tear gas. could somewhat blur the vision if youre in the smoke
[4:07:35] <emptyjuicecan> valve hire this mans
[4:07:37] <CeIIfps> Like a decay?
[4:07:37] <Snewby> thoughts on the concussion idea from val where your fire rate is impeded and vision reduced but not completely blind
[4:07:37] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m Save this for Not a Podcast fl0mHmm
[4:07:38] <lex_luthra> tripwire? which goes off  if someone walks past
[4:07:38] <sleeeeppyyyy> valve needs to add amouranth as an agent Kreygasm
[4:07:40] <ItsJustHenry> 10 smoke site takes lmaooo
[4:07:45] <Squach509> mini map emp grenade
[4:07:47] <bigdaddydave1> @fl0m gravity gun from half life, throw nades back
[4:07:47] <Destructoid5858> What if that utility only lasted 3-5 seconds instead of the regular smoke length
[4:07:47] <heisenburgblu> teargas
[4:07:49] <angrytreeclimber> how about a shrapnel grenade, less damage more AOE
[4:07:49] <LowRatedHighlander> @lucidr9 exactly Peepo
[4:07:49] <NoremaN> @fl0m the biggest problem with Val at the moment is lack of champions. League went threw this issue. for like 4-5 years.
[4:07:50] <bo0ya_> @fl0m the only new piece of utility they need is zeus skin.
[4:07:51] <caffeinetx> lex_luthra they have those in dangerzone
[4:07:54] <fedoralva> Office would suck in that case
[4:07:55] <dankiyy> it fucking sucks
[4:07:55] <praeter15> what about Jarate from TF2 peepoSit
[4:07:55] <stan0728> GabeN so now you'll teach me ?
[4:07:56] <starbasegoblins> We need more aggressive utility, current utility forces the game to be played much slower
[4:07:56] <SwifferWetWiener> what about a noob toob that can launch all your nades further faster
[4:07:56] <Alireza_GM> isn't that just molotov with low shader details pepeLaughings
[4:07:57] <Rossaroni> i think stun grenades are good as an alt flashbang. immobilizes you if you're really close, slows you down, movement speed comes back over 7s
[4:07:58] <yaboysmb> dont they have to up the limit of nades u can buy tho @fl0m  KEKWait
[4:07:58] <davaddacarry> what about like a concussion grenade thats like a HE but it makes you have the shaky vision and makes you not accurate.
[4:07:58] <Otschboh> @fl0m Thoughts on claymores on ct ?
[4:07:58] <HrabbiCerebuZ> Tear gas , like a smoke but you can hear someone cough in it
[4:07:58] <solopistolo> droping nades would be awesome
[4:07:59] <fedl1ngen> Footsteps decoy like in BR would be lit.
[4:08:00] <LucidR9> what about a triggered smoke, so you could throw it and it doesnt go off and later you could remotely trigger it @fl0m
[4:08:01] <Bashooka> @fl0m how about a syringe that gives u a small amount of health or someshit
[4:08:03] <chaoskompanie> and gives a sound cue too - so that you know that somebody tries to sneak trough it?
[4:08:04] <Snewby> nodders
[4:08:05] <jackx14> nades tho
[4:08:05] <SupraUK_> ye no that sounds awful
[4:08:06] <jamejacobs> doesn't molly slow down game?
[4:08:07] <arkzenx> They may do something after the major fl0mCozy
[4:08:07] <JP1910> yea doesnt sound too good
[4:08:09] <RummYY> what if you can see through the tear gas, kinda like molly smoke
[4:08:09] <Grimreminder> Just go full nutters and introduce the jump mines so we can introduce goomba stomping to competitive CS.
[4:08:11] <Terie54> Maybe a high powered rifle with tap fire could be decent imo, would be tough to balance
[4:08:14] <dankiyy> it is by far the worst type of non dmg effect
[4:08:14] <Killer_Panda2k11> Extend the utilty slot to 5, can carry any nade
[4:08:15] <lex_luthra> @caffeinetx oh nice, would it work in comp?
[4:08:17] <SICK0> fl0m literally throwing away a free podcast episode today
[4:08:19] <Deagent9> what about a nade that just removes your crosshair instead of being blind
[4:08:20] <njgyaani> ever considered a podcast pro valo v cs player
[4:08:21] <LucidR9> fl0m what about a triggered smoke, so you could throw it and it doesnt go off and later you could remotely trigger it @fl0m
[4:08:23] <WookiePotamus> @SICK0 IKR
[4:08:23] <bakktothefuture> @fl0m what about a nade that only breaks armor
[4:08:24] <omgsteppbro> oh hey fl0m man good morning
[4:08:25] <Otschboh> @fl0m Thoughts on claymores on ct ? HahaThink
[4:08:33] <Solank0> fl0m it would make sense to not have both, allowing you to throw off the timing of opposite team
[4:08:34] <imBacca> @fl0m 9banger???
[4:08:34] <stan0728> GabeN fl0m we need you here at valve
[4:08:36] <wxstfall> semtex could be played differently than the reg grenade
[4:08:36] <SwifferWetWiener> playing dead?
[4:08:38] <ra1n1ngdeath> Nets to catch chickens tho, HYPERCLAP
[4:08:40] <SupraUK_> lets talk about this interest match KappaHD
[4:08:44] <itsHAWKyotwitch> BRING BACK THE RIOTSHIELD
[4:08:44] <Rossaroni> remote triggered nades could be sick
[4:08:45] <DavieWhy> Mines?
[4:08:47] <dankiyy> so just add viper to the game
[4:08:48] <Justhoohaa> decoy with steps would be neat
[4:08:48] <minops_> motion detector?
[4:08:51] <s0up155> mines?
[4:08:51] <VeriVex> slippery banana
[4:08:52] <RealMajd> Mortar? LUL
[4:08:52] <LucidR9> like smoke from siege
[4:08:53] <Darra5> Smoke wall
[4:08:53] <dankiyy> no more walls on nuke
[4:08:55] <iizarian> @fl0m make the decoy triggerable, so that the might actually be used in a strat?
[4:08:57] <DT1224> What about a trophy system?
[4:09:01] <itsHAWKyotwitch> RIOTSHIELD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[4:09:02] <TheSolaceXD> you can slow someones sens down in val? LUL
[4:09:02] <ItsJustHenry> Does the triggered smoke not give CTs too much time to react? Like when they see it land before it gets triggered they can reposition
[4:09:04] <WookiePotamus> step decoy would ruin Silver MM KEKW
[4:09:04] <fedoralva> For the damaging smoke, make Molly's light it on fire in an explosion to do damage instead?
[4:09:04] <LucidR9> trophy system would be too op
[4:09:05] <dankiyy> what is this r6?
[4:09:08] <PerhapsItsPeach> fl0m talk about how big are bringing this interesting game back Kappa
[4:09:10] <SICK0> they already have wallhack nades in the game and c4s
[4:09:11] <JP1910> TRUE!
[4:09:12] <dylants> i doubt anything could be added that would fit
[4:09:12] <jockst3r> info gather items are dumb and too op
[4:09:12] <njgyaani> ever considered a pod cast for pro valo v csgo luv ur podcast
[4:09:12] <GuntherThePingouin> @fl0m  what about 12 sec regular smoke and 6 sec poison smoke that way smoke duration is the same
[4:09:13] <angrytreeclimber> oil slicks KEKW
[4:09:13] <friendlymackerel> triggered smoke that lasts like 12 seconds
[4:09:14] <ra1n1ngdeath> true
[4:09:15] <SICK0> time to bust them out
[4:09:16] <maxbax0808> Just the breach charges ? fl0m
[4:09:16] <c0smosLIVE> stop trying to make the game easier for noobs guys LUL
[4:09:16] <Darra5> heartbeat sensor that you can buy
[4:09:18] <djues333> @WookiePotamus how exactly?
[4:09:18] <wxstfall> trophy system would be nuts
[4:09:18] <clastonz> $10k jetpack, people fuckin flying
[4:09:20] <LucidR9> ninja monkey in cs?
[4:09:20] <SwifferWetWiener> throwing knife?
[4:09:24] <Mono1ow> a grenade that can break a wall?
[4:09:25] <djues333> @WookiePotamus silvers don't hear footsteps Kappa
[4:09:28] <stan0728> flare gun ?
[4:09:28] <Nemutai_jpeg> what if you had something like yorus footstep trap thing
[4:09:29] <frostiji> mud bucket you can throw to hear walking footsteps
[4:09:30] <JoshieSKun> 15 is all they get ? LETSGO
[4:09:31] <WookiePotamus> @djues333 true true KEKW
[4:09:34] <wattkins> a nade the negates hearing for a few seconds
[4:09:35] <Alps_san> CCTV in cs_assault @fl0m
[4:09:37] <Aurorn> Tear gas?
[4:09:37] <dankiyy> just add all DZ content to the game
[4:09:38] <SoporificPanda> what about the ability to strike everyone with lightning on the map and they become 1/3 of their normal size
[4:09:38] <ekstral0ve> but if you add any utlity that takes up time more than 5 seconds, the rounds will have to be extended
[4:09:38] <bigdaddydave1> oohhh breakable walls like battlefield
[4:09:39] <imBacca> @fl0m slow grenade
[4:09:40] <bakktothefuture> a nade that only breaks armor
[4:09:40] <Killer_Panda2k11> @fl0m What if you can control a chicken for longer than 30 seconds, they'll fetch a gun and have it for you at the end of the round
[4:09:41] <mymanmymanmy> Air nade that can make a gap in smokes
[4:09:48] <dersiegemaster> How about abilities, to reduce the effect of a flash, or lengthen the time a smoke stays in place?
[4:09:48] <82red2> @fl0m flare? Could cast shadows
[4:09:48] <Razr_BOI> im with the trophy idea @LucidR9
[4:09:50] <BizarreMark> Peepo how about adding a drone into the game
[4:09:52] <bigdaddydave1> yep exactly
[4:09:52] <LucidR9> what about like a camera that hovered above the map that a 6th player could look through and relay the info to the tea- ohhhhhh wait
[4:09:52] <sleepingraijin> wall climb rope.. self boosting
[4:09:53] <dylants> like crates
[4:09:53] <wxstfall> whoever said trophy system is a genius lmao
[4:09:54] <WookiePotamus> blow up car
[4:09:54] <apodis10> bring back the annoying source dust2 barrels
[4:09:55] <marcus1593813> maybe a grenade that only slows enemies as they walk through and nothing else?
[4:09:57] <Terie54> C4 would be could but it has to explode if hit by a molotov or nade so there is clearability and counterplay
[4:09:57] <Deagent9> but only with a certain piece of util that is expensive
[4:09:59] <Destructoid5858> What a slow down chain that the user throws. It doesn't completely prevent moving, but it slows the user down and maybe deals 5-10 dmg
[4:09:59] <billcypher28> 15 IS ALL THEY GET LETSGO
[4:10:00] <RummYY> like garage doors
[4:10:01] <bluehipp0> sadgeBusinessTime
[4:10:02] <Rossaroni> boxes you can hide in?
[4:10:02] <Oshubuds> How about a air canister? throw it inot a molly, it explodes. place it at a smoke and shoot it, removing the smoke.
[4:10:03] <stan0728> voos video on inferno
[4:10:06] <SICK0> would it be too weird to add the health stims to the actual game?
[4:10:07] <Killer_Panda2k11> R6 x CSGO
[4:10:07] <LowRatedHighlander> Indirect Info giving is vastly different from direct info
[4:10:08] <heisenburgblu> mid door  start closed on D2
[4:10:08] <Nemutai_jpeg> a decoy that plays like footsteps or reloading sounds or something
[4:10:08] <person612> like some of the spammable wood things
[4:10:08] <VeriVex> long term vision disruption. like a flare
[4:10:09] <maxbax0808> being able to move the bomb as a ct with grenades? fl0m
[4:10:10] <JP1910> but i mean doesnt it then slowly become r6 with all this util shit?
[4:10:11] <itsHAWKyotwitch> breakable map parts sound cool
[4:10:12] <abhi007bond> %? NIP FINISHES THIS
[4:10:12] <Nightbot> Joris says 70%
[4:10:12] <heisenburgblu> then nadews open it up
[4:10:13] <Swisha_24> what about deployable, destructible cover?
[4:10:13] <SwifferWetWiener> ability to high five?
[4:10:14] <ra1n1ngdeath> mid doors gone KEKWait
[4:10:15] <alemeffayoh> How about Bomb Bags from the ice cream man
[4:10:15] <Alireza_GM> At least have something blow up when the C4 blows the whole town
[4:10:16] <sleeeeppyyyy> next thing you guys want a tank. cs: battlefield edition paapoWeird
[4:10:17] <Timbot525> Blow up new box on inferno
[4:10:18] <MrRobbin_> what about wapons uppgrades?
[4:10:20] <RobertCamposs> that would suck, trust me i played enought R6
[4:10:26] <LucidR9> what about like a camera that hovered above the map that a 6th player could look through and relay the info to the tea- ohhhhhh wait
[4:10:27] <njgyaani> valo v csgo podcast idea luv ur podcast @fl0m
[4:10:28] <SICK0> NODDERS
[4:10:29] <cs_java> fire extinguisher that you can place anywhere on the map including walls, that puts out a white, not grey, smoke for less time than a normal smoke
[4:10:29] <Quailman1234> Maybe bleed status when you get hit without armor
[4:10:30] <ItsJustHenry> @Timbot525 lol YES
[4:10:31] <pigawn> Like the vents on mirage and nuke?
[4:10:33] <Darra5> Degen ability?

[4:10:35] <praeter15> what about a tactical nuke that ends the game if you go 25-0
[4:10:36] <Cacemen> @fl0m what about an RPG?
[4:10:37] <wattkins> i just want my operator to wear jordans is that to much to ask
[4:10:44] <parhamdd> poison gas and a gas mask that prevent taking damage
[4:10:45] <friendlymackerel> movement stim could be cool
[4:10:46] <dankiyy> just make cs an mmorpg
[4:10:47] <sam19n7> CSGO IS BALANCED AS IT IS
[4:10:51] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m cs needs Finishers like war zone

[4:10:58] <jockst3r> KEKW
[4:10:59] <LucidR9> make the fl0m operator have a voice command that asks for five gifted, that's the only problem with the game
[4:10:59] <MrRobbin_> what about wapons uppgrades???
[4:11:01] <palindrome____> Sit in the car at long D2 and drive around killinng everyone
[4:11:02] <dankiyy> praeter15 HYPERNODDERS
[4:11:04] <BizarreMark> KEKW
[4:11:05] <Paroto7> or maybe making a new post plant spot to hold using destructible environment
[4:11:07] <siiiif> I think they should add a bench to mid. I know its a big shock to the game, but it will add alot Peepo
[4:11:07] <heisenburgblu> gg
[4:11:08] <alemeffayoh> BOMB BAGS!!!  from the ice cream man
[4:11:09] <SupraUK_> ye he just joined chat

[4:11:10] <wxstfall> trophy system
[4:11:11] <mymanmymanmy> We need some type of system to nerf smokes
[4:11:12] <SupraUK_> don't worry about it
[4:11:13] <SoporificPanda> you should be able to turn into a giant dinosaur and eat the enemies
[4:11:14] <mayhem_666_> @fl0m option to buy suppressors for any guns maybe
[4:11:15] <Quailman1234> Blood trail if under 50 hp

[4:11:24] <BizarreMark> PauseFish
[4:11:25] <SupraUK_> %? nip choke
[4:11:25] <Nightbot> Joris says 100%
[4:11:27] <jockst3r> @ItsJustHenry in csgo
[4:11:27] <itsHAWKyotwitch> booba traps !?
[4:11:27] <arkzenx> I think they will let you see your legs and add shoes skins in the next update.
[4:11:28] <cool_guy_168> i think the decoys need a rework
[4:11:29] <Rossaroni> VAC
[4:11:29] <cloutburstgg> they should add a bazooka @fl0m :D
[4:11:30] <palindrome____> GG

[4:11:33] <BizarreMark> Sadge
[4:11:34] <maxbax0808> NOOO
[4:11:34] <apodis10> the biggest revolution of all, being able to unbind taking off the silencer of guns
[4:11:35] <PerhapsItsPeach> YEP  Cheating
[4:11:36] <mikeid> @fl0m We need the Shield and Nightvision goggles back
[4:11:37] <ItsJustHenry> @jockst3r w h e n
[4:11:39] <bakktothefuture> a grenade that breaks armor?
[4:11:39] <wsx05> @fl0m what about like a night mode or different lighting
[4:11:39] <wattkins> gratfiti can also mace the target
[4:11:41] <Razr_BOI> let me be able to throw my knife at people lmfao
[4:11:44] <LucidR9> what about like an audio booster, so if you threw it over onto b site you could hear things from tunns happening on the site for a short time @fl0m
[4:11:45] <siiiif> peepoSit add a deployabl stepstool to the game
[4:11:45] <jockst3r> 2012 release
[4:11:46] <dersiegemaster> Fl0m how about 'skills' that reduces the time your screen is white from a flash, or that lengthen the ammount of time a smoke stays in place?
[4:11:47] <swiftwizard2> what about a nade that only fucks with sound
[4:11:47] <DevilJack> @fl0m Do you think device's preformance has dropped since astralis?
[4:11:48] <nyssen> I think bringing back more spammable surfaces would be good.  1.6 had a weird meta shift around 2007/2008 where teams would start rounds by spamming multiple angles at the same time.  Nuke flipped to being a lot more T-sided when that hit.
[4:11:49] <Cacemen> something like a toxic cloud like the things in APEX from costic @fl0m
[4:11:52] <cool_guy_168> the decoys need a rework i think
[4:11:53] <Swisha_24> electric shock grenade that makes the floor static and slows down movement
[4:11:56] <WookiePotamus> peepoRiot RIOT SHEILD peepoRiot
[4:11:59] <viking_mercenary> ez points Clap

[4:12:03] <r0gu3_z> Add a silencer that can be added to most guns but it costs 2000
[4:12:04] <Shimshammie> what about trip wire bomb?  could be defused if you have a kit?
[4:12:05] <NoremaN> @fl0m What about a delayed flash? Like it does a decoy flash sound and then flashes 1 second later?
[4:12:05] <Darra5> scolding KEKW
[4:12:08] <LowRatedHighlander> Peepo
[4:12:10] <cloutburstgg> riot shields will be fun
[4:12:10] <LucidR9> fl0m what about like an audio booster, so if you threw it over onto b site you could hear things from tunns happening on the site for a short time @fl0m

[4:12:12] <SupraUK_> HYPERGAMBLE

[4:12:13] <Cacemen> you could see trhough it but did damage if you go inside it @fl0m

[4:12:50] <dankiyy> add a roombot and rpg, give cluster grenade
[4:12:51] <virtualhoaxx> I really like the idea of trigger nades. Like a molotov going off on another site when someone walks
[4:12:51] <Cacemen> @fl0m what about an RPG?
[4:12:52] <frenchzebra> maybe like sand bags
[4:12:53] <bruhandon46> bump mines in comp

[4:12:55] <a732v> what about a tactical nuke?

[4:12:57] <ByakkoGTV> @fl0m send help. I just ate 10 white castles
[4:12:57] <Killer_Panda2k11> What about magic?
[4:12:58] <stucko> Fuck it, give us bomb vests Kappa
[4:12:59] <frenchzebra> so you could make togglable cover
[4:12:59] <starbasegoblins> We need more aggressive utility, something that forces the game to speed up rather than slow down
[4:13:00] <texerson> gas grenade that has a tick damage
[4:13:00] <CortanaLXIX> R EZ
[4:13:00] <Swisha_24> bro i got it! HOOK! bring hook back and you have to manually bind it through console

[4:13:05] <Morde24> only add rc car if it goes boom
[4:13:05] <Mulukky> @fl0m riot shield was the best
[4:13:06] <wallmanm> you have equipped rocket launcher
[4:13:08] <Justhoohaa> they could add a camera you can place and just call it hunden
[4:13:10] <wattkins> you should able to throw your gun at people when you run out of ammo
[4:13:11] <Morde24> maybe call it a boom car?
[4:13:12] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m what if they added an SKS kinda like the Guardian for Valorant but no ADS
[4:13:12] <doctordoctor_> hear me out, 4 man rez

[4:14:32] <bakktothefuture> If they added an armor box a nade or somethign that breaks armor would work as well
[4:14:33] <RummYY> ez
[4:14:33] <Mulukky> @fl0m tank would be ok or Apache
[4:14:34] <dersiegemaster> I mean @fl0m would it be bad to add 'skills' that reduce the time your screen is white from a flash or increase how long a smoke stays, maybe decrease or increase the damage a HE nade does, and things like that.

[4:14:50] <frostiji> exo suit with auto bhop
[4:14:51] <iizarian> make the decoy triggerable with a special key so it only fires when you hit the key, and when thrown underhanded it wont make a sound when landing. no visible timer so you have to keep track off its timeframe on your own.
[4:14:53] <r0gu3_z> An acid that would allow more penetration to a wall
[4:14:55] <maxbax0808> longer knifes that are slower but have a higher reach

[4:15:00] <Mahesh277> We are thinking too deep which never gonna happen in csgo

[4:15:32] <LowRatedHighlander> @djues333 yeah and you can like fly up occasionally. And like maybe even dash side to side Peepo
[4:15:34] <Hookzy_> They should add a bazooka to the game! 100%
[4:15:35] <Nylucc> maps were not made to accomodate that kind of nade tho
[4:15:35] <IceRenamonGaming> we penetrating walls now? gachiBASS
[4:15:35] <Timbot525> @wookiepotamus so I can grapple back up vertigo when I fall off

[4:15:35] <nerkkin> Has anyone mentioned a healing item yet?
[4:15:36] <jockst3r> @fl0m in 1.6 you bought ammo...what about armor pen ammo or something like that
[4:15:37] <Thegnarlynarwhal> extended magazines but less rounds
[4:15:39] <mavesuvius> AIR STRIKES
[4:15:40] <Terie54> breach charges that could be used to break walls and do some he damage
[4:15:40] <fedl1ngen> Bring back VIP maps.
[4:15:41] <dolev801> like a wall crackers

[4:15:41] <gyggles> Portal guns?
[4:15:41] <nanerpus_> bring back the 1.6 spam spots
[4:15:42] <DeusNightFire> and having like raiding a room with lights?
[4:15:46] <person612> like a smoke grenade that makes your screen go minecraft nausea
[4:15:46] <Destructoid5858> Armor HE grenade. It does more dmg to the receivers armor and still a bit a dmg to the users health
[4:15:47] <nerkkin> SeemsGood
[4:15:47] <itsHAWKyotwitch> they can literally change the recoil system and make it a bit more realistic and tactical and it would be a brand new game completely
[4:15:47] <siiiif> praeter15 noooooo that would be crazy
[4:15:48] <wxstfall> add a third armor choice to only purchase head armor but your movement speed is increased
[4:15:48] <SwifferWetWiener> what if for bomb defuse the bomb has to have a code typed in displayed on the bomb that you have to click the buttons on the bomb to type in only visible after standard defuse time
[4:15:51] <billcypher28> LETSGO
[4:15:52] <KamJam> flamethrower

[4:16:08] <DaiMars> being able to place wall
[4:16:08] <Scornfulboot_eu> granade launcher
[4:16:10] <undercoverbulbasaur> Yeah knife round in MM would be dope

[4:16:20] <necroix0> @fl0m what about a sound grenade and a headset to block it. if u are in reach u cant hear steps and shots for a short time
[4:16:20] <san2194> one of the podcasts mentioned 1.6 had you buying ammo for each of the guns
[4:16:21] <DavveSQ> !sens

[4:16:30] <HrabbiCerebuZ> The market for realistic slow paced shooters is already finen
[4:16:30] <ItsJustHenry> A single shot rpg would be quite cool lol
[4:16:32] <iizarian> when about a sentry grenade that is like a decoy that can make enemies show up on then map when the grenade has them in line of sight within a certain distance
[4:16:33] <starbasegoblins> Add the breaching charge from the BR mode
[4:16:34] <jockst3r> what about the ct's can pick up the bomb and defuse it at all times Kapp
[4:16:34] <Rossaroni> the ct's need to replace defuse kits with liquid nitrogen cans that can also be used to slow down enemies slightly
[4:16:35] <th3kery> @fl0m you have one knife and u can throw it and does 25 to arms legs, 50 body and 75 head. and u can throwit one round once
[4:16:37] <praeter15> remove spray patterns make bullets go where your xhair is

[4:17:18] <danielvaltameri> There's a lot you could do but a lot could also go wrong with many of these ideas, but I guess that's why it takes time to really come up with games in a similar vein
[4:17:19] <Dexterity15> Wtf what????
[4:17:23] <small_tymer> what about a perk system that counters one piece of utility but makes you  more vulnerable to another
[4:17:28] <Rossaroni> auto sniper insurance
[4:17:29] <davaddacarry> I think the idea of budget util would be cool
[4:17:29] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m what about making the bomb plant 7 seconds and making the Ts buy a kit to plant faster
[4:17:32] <bigdaddydave1> I like the idea of droppable utility. I wish they would implement that
[4:17:32] <person612> they should give the mp5sd more ammo so it could be used for spamming smokes

[4:21:59] <nanerpus_> To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.

[4:22:55] <Darra5> fl0m wanted to say low risk, low IQ
[4:22:59] <WookiePotamus> thats why i use the R8

[4:22:59] <f0rreverr> agreed
[4:23:00] <DavieWhy> SCOPED PISTOL
[4:23:00] <crocswsocks> could they fix that by just decreasing fire rate?
[4:23:00] <LucidR9> but what about FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
[4:23:00] <hobrev> and its still a shadow of what it used to be in source
[4:23:02] <dankiyy> for the love of everything keep it 1 shot to the head
[4:23:03] <Cacemen> w8 the otheir way
[4:23:03] <wxstfall> cs could add a better overtime feature. almost like gulags but better tuned for csgo and the playstyle
[4:23:05] <djues333> @friendlymackerel and idk if just bhopping around would be an enjoyable playing (and viewing) experience, I'd love it though KEKW

[4:23:19] <ekstral0ve> what does a kill with a deag get you again in money? k frogtot
[4:23:20] <Matata12922> deagle helps ct side tho a bit
[4:23:22] <virtualhoaxx> "Viewers in your region can only predict without using any Channel Points" chill tf out twitch
[4:23:24] <flyguy1449> I think the deagle also just outcompetes shotguns, I feel like they could actually be viable without the deagle
[4:23:24] <dylants> agree completely
[4:23:24] <raynor90> the double body shot is aids

[4:23:46] <LucidR9> well, long range, it doesnt
[4:23:46] <zoofuu_> I’d say the deagle is the iconic CSGO weapon though

[4:24:07] <tr3y919> what about no armor 2 shot armom 3 shot?
[4:24:08] <WookiePotamus> u just make it a 33.5 damage per shot and a 4x multiplier to the head
[4:24:08] <DavieWhy> What if we put a scope on the r8 lmao
[4:24:10] <dankiyy> rn 2 shots just do 160 dmg LUL
[4:24:11] <BizarreMark> peepoRiot and also fix CT side economy

[4:24:47] <SwifferWetWiener> my opinion the only thing they should add to steam is fl0ms signature on my profile
[4:24:48] <SupraUK_> P250 > Deagle > 5-7
[4:24:49] <dankiyy> @dankiyy 1 shot in the lower body is 80 or something yes
[4:24:50] <XeeVzz> @fl0m maybe add a smoke that it will take a little  from your health if you push it ,and will kill you if you sit in it or try to phase it.
[4:24:51] <VeriVex> member when the deagle sucked
[4:24:59] <wxstfall> five seven accuracy needs to increase
[4:25:05] <fedoralva> Doesn't the AK take 4 to the body though?
[4:25:05] <Cacemen> @fl0m any previsions for when the next silver cast will happen?
[4:25:05] <sjoerdtheman> why people use the deagle while the R8 exists baffles me
[4:25:12] <ItsJustHenry> @fl0m clearly hasn't watched silvers saying the deagle is too ez to use
[4:25:17] <sylphreet> need sova dart in new cs
[4:25:17] <Scornfulboot_eu> makes it so cts can still have a chance with thier shitty economy @fl0m
[4:25:18] <jockst3r> someone famous once said you can always afford a p250. Now its you can always afford a deag

[4:40:49] <Destructoid5858> What about 2 HE's?
[4:40:50] <AyrenTheWolf> CT holds would just be nutty with two smokes a person
[4:40:51] <fredthashed> two smokes what is this valorant
[4:40:52] <stan0728> i smoke 2 smokes everyday fl0m
[4:40:53] <maT_whiTeho> 5 flashes per person
[4:40:54] <Destructoid5858> Or 5 decoy's
[4:40:57] <TheBlankSkies> yea bc of how many smoke lineups in spawn

[4:41:17] <dec0dep> @djues333 true, forget about inferno B site
[4:41:19] <Sergeantdude_rl> 5 decoys would actually be hilarious
[4:41:19] <Deagent9> you just get a tazer instead of pistol
[4:41:20] <LucidR9> what about an underbarrel attachment that can fire nades so you dont have to swap to nades to throw them @fl0m
[4:41:23] <Destructoid5858> Then they can be more useful to deceive the enemy about about many of which guns your team has
[4:41:28] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m What about being able to carry a 2nd gun fl0mHmm
[4:41:28] <dankiyy> d2 mid cross was so easy
