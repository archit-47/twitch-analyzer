[5:25:04] <Justhoohaa> @slimrick6 I don't mean it disrespectful. I just don't tune into a stream because they are sponsored by "X" product.
[5:25:05] <wrecktangle321> fair enough, i never meant any disrespect, I just wanted your take on how common sponsorships are and if its still holds the same meaning to be sponsored by some big company as it did back in the day but again, good point that for the streamer it wont ever matter to much

[8:33:58] <stt0nk> get deathmark stuff because acrid already gets one effect off of his basic. (deathmark, gasoline, tri tips, chronoboble) then i would say get visions of heresy since acrid becomes a ranged character rather than a semi ranged. you could also get hooks of herest if u want  @fl0m

[8:45:16] <LowRatedHighlander> Pog shatterspleen is so good on you and just in general
[8:45:19] <stt0nk> I would highly recommend getting a newt altar and trying to get a visions of heresy since acrid has no place being in melee range. it makes him a ranged character which he should be anyways
[8:45:43] <DrtNinja> get some shrooms for josh
[8:45:47] <stt0nk> and since you have an afterburner you can bounce in and out leaving the poision trail
[8:46:45] <LowRatedHighlander> damn yall are making good time

[9:19:29] <SukksGaming> @spli7er My country doesnt allow to gamba channel points Sadge
[9:19:47] <datkidaa> I thought this was america
[9:19:52] <spli7er> damn
[9:19:58] <LowRatedHighlander> so they need to complete this stage and then charge the pillars on the next stage. or if they somehow figure it out skip the pillars and insta start the mythrix fight
[9:20:05] <crocswsocks> i'm really the only person who bet on this? lol
[9:20:15] <SukksGaming> But besides no gambling, Europe is the bestest country of the USA
[9:20:24] <LowRatedHighlander> slow degen night i guess SHRUGGERS
[9:20:31] <crocswsocks> FEelsBadMan
[9:21:06] <spli7er> it was a HYPERGAMBLE
[9:21:07] <LowRatedHighlander> whats weird is it says you did gamble SukksGaming but you gamble 0 points
[9:21:13] <iTysonator252> yooooo if your homie is playing loader too you can grapple off your homie while he is grappling
[9:21:18] <iTysonator252> the funniest shit ever
[9:21:26] <SukksGaming> Yeah, i can predict. But i cant spend channel points Sadge
[9:21:53] <crocswsocks> yeah don't grapple on those guys
[9:21:55] <spli7er> that sucks

[9:22:26] <AnthonyPerfetto> bro that shirt is sick @fl0m.  where can i cop that
[9:22:35] <Kend0g2020> @SukksGaming They consider it actual gambling when the points have literally no value?

[9:22:57] <AnthonyPerfetto> day is ruined
[9:23:11] <Kend0g2020> @crocswsocks Really? Why would anyone do that?
[9:23:11] <LowRatedHighlander> wait what?
[9:23:13] <crocswsocks> and twitch doesn't regulate what the points can be used for
[9:23:23] <crocswsocks> if you sub you get 1.2x points
[9:23:26] <LowRatedHighlander> crocswsocks do you mean by subbing?

[9:24:38] <LowRatedHighlander> not yet Kend0g2020
[9:24:41] <Kend0g2020> @LowRatedHighlander Awesome info, thanks!
[9:24:49] <Nightbot> Latest video: CS:GO but I Hit a Wallbang You've Never Seen Before! - https://youtu.be/YB_lqCG6tTQ
[9:25:10] <LowRatedHighlander> so they have to tele to the next stage. complete some pillar charge stuff. and then launch up to where mythrix is
[9:25:16] <dirty_kiwi> you took both
[9:25:23] <dirty_kiwi> you stutter stepped left
[9:25:26] <crocswsocks> deskplant OMEGALUL
[9:25:32] <crocswsocks> worst red in the game @fl0m
[9:25:39] <LowRatedHighlander> or if theyre 5Head they find an equipment that takes them both to the top
[9:25:49] <stt0nk> @crocswsocks the most cap ive ever seen
[9:25:49] <LowRatedHighlander> deskplant is uhhhhhh
[9:25:52] <iTysonator252> the only way it could be worse is if you were ranged
[9:25:59] <ShadowsAura> you can trade it next stage im pretty sure
[9:26:00] <ShadowsAura> on the moon
[9:26:15] <LowRatedHighlander> depends on if theres a white cauldren
[9:26:19] <LowRatedHighlander> sometimes there isnt
[9:26:26] <crocswsocks> stt0nk its literally useless in the mithrix fight
[9:26:49] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah its basically useless in the mythrix fight
[9:26:58] <stt0nk> @crocswsocks yeah for mithrix of course but i thought you meant in general
[9:27:14] <crocswsocks> I mean, its still pretty bad in general
[9:27:14] <mindframeawful> s
[9:27:23] <LowRatedHighlander> i think its debatable
[9:27:32] <crocswsocks> unless you get it first stage and that is your only healing
[9:27:33] <LowRatedHighlander> happiest mask is also kinda bad for a red
[9:27:40] <stt0nk> its saved my life multiple times
[9:28:14] <crocswsocks> its very situational
[9:28:15] <stt0nk> when you are looping and you are killing tens on mobs at a time there is always like 20 on the ground
[9:28:21] <Koreyzk> Koreyzk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 
[9:28:21] <Techno> - Koreyzk just re-subscribed for 22 months! fl0mPog
[9:28:36] <LowRatedHighlander> stt0nk i think the big thing to keep in mind is what the other reds can do
[9:28:38] <fhilcollins> All about the goat hooves
[9:28:45] <LowRatedHighlander> so comparatively its bad for a red
[9:28:49] <crocswsocks> but by the time you are looping you have scythes, leeching seeds and other heals
[9:28:53] <stt0nk> @fl0m dont worry about killing all the mobs just go to the pillars and ignore them
[9:28:58] <crocswsocks> and exactly what low rated said
[9:29:02] <Kend0g2020> When I latch onto my own thing I get kicked out of the public park
[9:29:04] <spli7er> PauseFish
[9:29:06] <LowRatedHighlander> like yes its good and can save you but almost all the other reds are a lot better
[9:29:07] <stt0nk> @LowRatedHighlander thats fair but its defo not the worst
[9:29:08] <SupraUK_> hey fl0m looking good

[9:32:02] <crocswsocks> believers, i give you good odds again
[9:32:27] <spli7er> 10k on no may the gamba gods be with me
[9:32:43] <stt0nk> @fl0m make sure you get a lot of backup mags, syringes, and crit glasses. iff you see things like rose bucklers and infusions prioritize those since huntress has low survivability.

[9:33:00] <Kend0g2020> I cant bet too many points they are all invested in AMC
[9:33:10] <Speedrulez> apparently crit is this move fl0m
[9:33:24] <iTysonator252> crit, attack speed, a wax quail is really nice
[9:33:28] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah the usual attack speed crit is really good. move speed as always.
[9:33:38] <F1niteCS> Speedrulez PeepoJuice
[9:33:39] <420Enigma> bleed is real good too
[9:33:41] <LowRatedHighlander> crit is good on everyone
[9:33:49] <tossacoinforthetwitcher> something bout the map color turning me off from this game
[9:33:56] <iTysonator252> @420Enigma its only good through thespecial yellow item
[9:33:57] <Speedrulez> @f1nitecs roo4
[9:34:00] <Kend0g2020> @fl0m criticizing the crit
[9:34:05] <LowRatedHighlander> tossacoinforthetwitcher theyre not all like that
[9:34:12] <F1niteCS> Speedrulez PauseFish
[9:34:13] <stt0nk> *Rose buckler, and infusion are important items for huntress*
[9:34:19] <Speedrulez> @f1nitecs rooSip
[9:34:26] <Speedrulez> attack speed fl0m
[9:34:27] <crocswsocks> crit, attack speed, bleed is decent
[9:34:31] <Solank0> Build for speed, you dont need dmg when you fast a.f boy
[9:34:32] <iTysonator252> on hits like the runaalds band are really good too
[9:34:41] <tossacoinforthetwitcher> @lowratedhighlander thx ill check some vids
[9:34:42] <fhilcollins> Goat hooves
[9:35:17] <Kend0g2020> When in doubt, POGDOG it out
[9:35:18] <fricks_lozf> hey fl0m and chat MLADY
[9:35:18] <stt0nk> also i dont know how much you play this game but if you play it fairly regularly then i would go get some of the loadout abilities for the characters you play the most.
[9:35:22] <somanybiscuits> no joke got Nathans because of these streams last time I got some dogs
[9:35:30] <LowRatedHighlander> huntress is one of the survivors that you pretty much can throw anything on and itll be usefull and focus on the normal stuff like crit/attack speed/ and move speed
[9:35:35] <datkidaa> we out here
[9:35:41] <datkidaa> POGDOG

[9:53:40] <LowRatedHighlander> your equipment heals you or whoever you use it on
[9:53:43] <LowRatedHighlander> well the one you had
[9:53:49] <Nightbot> Latest video: CS:GO but I Hit a Wallbang You've Never Seen Before! - https://youtu.be/YB_lqCG6tTQ
[9:53:50] <crocswsocks> no you have to activate it
[9:53:54] <LowRatedHighlander> you can activate it though fl0m
[9:54:02] <thech3mistt> wasn't the equipment a passive heal
[9:54:11] <crocswsocks> no when you activate it, it heals you
[9:54:13] <crocswsocks> nonono
[9:54:17] <LowRatedHighlander> noooooooooo
[9:54:21] <thech3mistt> activate was send it to partner though
[9:54:24] <LowRatedHighlander> you can activate on yourself or other things
[9:54:31] <crocswsocks> no KEKWiggle
[9:54:37] <overrated_tv> when you activate it and it doesnt go to someone it gives you a bigish heal
[9:54:39] <LowRatedHighlander> it does a passive little baby heal
[9:54:56] <LowRatedHighlander> but it does a decent heal on yourself when you activate it
[9:55:16] <crocswsocks> it has a really short cool down so you can use it often
[9:55:18] <LowRatedHighlander> well it can go to someone if youre looking at something when you activate it
[9:55:47] <LowRatedHighlander> omg these odds KEKW
[9:55:49] <crocswsocks> live and learn
[9:56:01] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKWiggle
[9:56:14] <thech3mistt> its not obvious from the description
[9:56:23] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah it can be a bit misleading
[9:56:40] <fifalee> monthly reminder that you have a nice cock bro
[9:56:51] <crocswsocks> a lot of the items are that way I feel. the descriptions are very ambiguous
[9:57:15] <LowRatedHighlander> theres a lot about some items that you just cant fit everything in the description
[9:57:23] <LowRatedHighlander> although some could be a bit more detailed
[9:57:30] <Pau11y_> ...and his music was electric.
[9:57:47] <crocswsocks> theres a mod for better items descriptions and stats
[9:57:49] <LowRatedHighlander> catJAM
[9:57:50] <Pau11y_> best item in the game and you wouldnt know it
