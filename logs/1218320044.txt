[0:59:04] <nickthesizz> I hope to see Stew and NAF together still
[0:59:05] <sm0ke_ii> they lost 3 tho :/
[0:59:07] <anirudhamar04> so fl0m to TL is off??
[0:59:10] <lolypop98> fl0m awp-er for liquid Pog confirmed
[0:59:10] <santinoj9> N0thing, skadoodle, shroud, autimatic and stewie2k new liquid roster
[0:59:11] <dweevers> fl0m do they try junior? I know it didn't work on furia but I still think he could be a decent awper pickup
[0:59:13] <BakkerTwitch> Well NA cs is over then Kappa
[0:59:14] <Hektic2> I'm happy Nitr0 is back thats it
[0:59:17] <hemo_tox> yeeesh
[0:59:19] <locustyears> PREACH.
[0:59:20] <SukksGaming> Stewie will become the first pro krunker player
[0:59:21] <BalumaNotSoHot> i feel like if osee goes there he will ruin his career right? @fl0m
[0:59:21] <marine5014> @element0x then why arent you on the stage?
[0:59:22] <hemo_tox> thats a yikes from me
[0:59:22] <YujnFPS> Cheer100 any rumors for where grim is going?
[0:59:23] <yaJgnizamA> SeriousSloth
[0:59:24] <Dynamo_Dave> @suprauk_ Sadge
[0:59:24] <the_scrash> Would it be better if nitr0 replaced fallen and everyone else would stay ?
[0:59:25] <speciality_> oSee prob stays idk, unless JT + Floppy happens as well
[0:59:25] <guckmalnachhinten_> well better than eg atm
[0:59:27] <Slasher> do you think Liquid taking Vini could be potentially a buiness decision to keep the brazilian fanbae?
[0:59:28] <itsPoZr> @fl0m I feel like Fallen just speedran this Blast tournament just so he could leave quicker LUL
[0:59:29] <splitzky__> please don't turn oSee into another koosta Sadge
[0:59:30] <Hektic2> But if they just got rid of Fallen and put Nitr0 for him, it would be a good mix I think

[0:59:34] <killabeeztv> i would have liked to have seen nitr0 Eliige Naf Brehze and Cerq, that would be a good roster
[0:59:39] <element0x> @marine5014 because I already have nice life and work ...
[0:59:41] <officer_ant> I wish junior would get some more experience, he could be a good fit as an NA AWPer
[0:59:47] <Hektic2> Grim is a really good player with Team Liquid
[0:59:51] <okiseky> do u think if stew tim and naf went to Eg to brehze and cerq would be good?
[1:00:00] <sylveonkid1> why would you get rid of grim? aint he a human aimbot
[1:00:02] <audio_noodle> @fl0m we just need a retirement home of og2 to house all those players Sadge
[1:00:03] <Mumflr830> astralis looks weird without zonic
[1:00:03] <locustyears> Man, I am glad I am not the only person who thinks that EU players treat NA as a paycheck stopgap.

[1:00:09] <cranidos_11> PepeLaugh
[1:00:09] <nickthesizz> Liquid keeping the least likable player
[1:00:10] <skylo_y> cant they try to keep stew and naf, and elige, if nitr0 and tim are on their way out in valorant
[1:00:12] <dcn1ghtwing> I get liquid dropping stew, fallen and grim. but I think they should've kept naf. having naf and elige as riflers is an elite combo.

[1:01:04] <nifonz> naf popped off this tourn
[1:01:05] <derius1> what's flom's take on lucky atm?
[1:01:08] <yaJgnizamA> maybe naf will become a streamer and replace fl0m again KEKW
[1:01:11] <DimitriPascaluta> you're just saying that because he replaced you
[1:01:13] <vinciCS> Liquid would never willingly drop NAF, so he wanted to leave on his own which is even more concerning for the Liquid situation
[1:01:13] <audio_noodle> all those lost rounds just have the arena being dead quiet KEKW
[1:01:13] <guscantsleep> Im super down to see the EG roster

[1:01:21] <locustyears> @froster5226 Why would Naf retire? He was just top-fragging, lol.
[1:01:22] <Hektic2> Best roster for Team Liquid... Stew, Naf, Grim, Elige, and Nitr0
[1:01:24] <slugycs> wait why is JoJoDJ mod but i'm not paapoWeird
[1:01:25] <FrostedAlibi> lmao
[1:01:26] <BenForFriends> Anything new about C9 @fl0m ?

[1:54:46] <jgrasp_> Maybe unpopular opinion but the Danish crowd sucks. It’s dead silent every time Astralis loses a round
[1:54:49] <slugycs> checking util damage inbetween rounds is also useful to see if your nade/molly hit
[1:54:56] <anirudhamar04> why dont they tell  damage??
[1:55:05] <itPat> valorant shouldn't
[1:55:07] <murel> at the end of the round_
[1:55:08] <cjlessthan3> Glaive said "hurt 60" when he hit someone for 58 on Nuke hes a gamer
[1:55:10] <murel> ?
[1:55:10] <ancalagon9608> really, not even like in faceit?
[1:55:18] <f0rreverr> everyone knows anyone you shoot is always 1 shot
[1:55:18] <jbirdblue> @jgrasp_ imagine LOL
[1:55:21] <glaizeeee> does it appear on console?
[1:55:22] <ItsJustKetsu> I don't follow the scene that much, is Astralis still the dominant team or have they fallen off?
[1:55:23] <dimesntreys> valorant also tells you how much money the other team has because smol brain
[1:55:25] <fareminkers> well you know if a nade hit someone at the end of the round even if you didnt see it land

[1:59:59] <50CEMENT> *gently squeezes his shoulder
[2:00:16] <DrIsaac> I agree, i think spawns in valorant would be way more interesting if you all started in spawn when the round officially starts.
[2:00:16] <beta_kush> Valve was smart all along??
[2:00:31] <jimmerg87> @abdo_2_ theyre always important obviously, but the only map ive hit a 4k nade is inferno lolol

[2:00:38] <phd120> why is it necessary to compare every cs aspect to a valorant aspect
[2:00:46] <abdo_2_> @jimmerg87 LUL
[2:00:47] <alexboneinwings> Valorant won't last as long as a game purely because of the lack of a skill gap
[2:00:51] <Morde24> so 100T is ditching another FPS?
[2:00:54] <FlameyKumori> @beta_kush Valve was never dumb, they just ignore us. Sadge

[2:01:23] <KT_Mike> @fl0m any idea why Nitro wanted to go back to CS? Has he openly said why?
[2:01:24] <JuiceW4H> The mechanics of the game are almost the same that`s why.
[2:01:25] <retiiful> I AM NOT DUMB rooMadslam

[2:58:56] <Madfish2021> they need tier 1 teams to prac against and all the tier 1 teams are in EU. Its no good them scrimming against tier 2 NA teams... Makes no sense
[2:59:01] <sylveonkid1> you think ethan comes back to csgo?
[2:59:08] <Bob0_s> @fl0m Stan strikes me as someone who's got no work ethic anymore you think it was because EG was dead in the water or just him losing motivation?

[2:59:50] <kamelski> big difference is in EU some countries are pushing CS while in NA mostly business pushes "new" games like cod and valo.. you need to get barstool on board :P

[2:59:57] <F1niteCS> WookiePotamus does it have white sauce? like is it a chicken alfredo pizza?
[3:00:01] <sylveonkid1> @fl0m did flashpoint give up as a to?
[3:00:10] <WookiePotamus> @f1nitecs yeah
[3:00:12] <andrewmedaTV> @bob0_s from what I’ve heard, Stan is more of a CS pro just because teams keep picking him up. He doesn’t really have a love for the game
[3:00:15] <itsMasterSprinkles> ESL needs to chill
[3:00:28] <Bob0_s> @andrewmedaTV thats what I thought it looked like myself tbh
[3:00:28] <WookiePotamus> chicken and red sauce doing really vibe TBH unless it's chicken parm
[3:00:29] <F1niteCS> WookiePotamus if I'm in the mood for it, chicken alfredo pizza is undefeated.

[3:33:40] <dan1iels> 1%
[3:33:40] <Morde24> streamlabs is the kid who copied your homework, then when you both got called into the principals office for it, streamlabs dragged you down with him for something you didnt do

[3:34:45] <hunter6925> its not so much about the "homework" itself, its all open source... the issue was the name
[3:34:45] <nickthesizz> for NAVI itll be high for russian stream too

[3:35:06] <FlameyKumori> @BuSheeZy I know, I meant I just assumed it was a fork but didn't think it was partnered more just some sort of agreement between the two, because SLOBS always felt worse than Studio in terms of QoL elements in the UI
[3:35:08] <tangoernie> @fl0m can i link my brothers faceit or no
[3:35:10] <cr4zydavey> 500 during the final

[4:50:14] <ShawnMCS_> i feel like RUSH is still mega underrated, u got grim, auti, PA guys, BNB guys, get a fourth team behind ES, Liquid, EG
[4:50:20] <muddychor> isnt valorant better if its major gets more prize money than csgo
[4:50:25] <Fl3mington> marketing and interest
[4:50:30] <Fl3mington> na needs that for sure
[4:50:49] <Achapman18> thats how navi has gotten so good
[4:50:51] <Fyxtro_live> That PostureCheck tho
[4:50:53] <HeyKroZ_> Clapgers the bestest
[4:50:54] <Spider22Monkey> but having more of those top teams, wouldnt that make it better for teams to prac in NA?

[4:51:04] <OGWerp> I forgot stanislaw and obo are both free agents too
[4:51:05] <glaizeeee> @muddychor valorant is more friendly, and it appeals to opposite gender as well compared to cs which makes it incredibly popular

[4:51:38] <salmonknight2> more advertiser friendly = better Pog
[4:51:44] <glaizeeee> @blanplam already finals bud
[4:51:50] <moosE3knucklE> I really think Extra Salt can go far in Pro League. Mad Lion's were the 18th ranked team on HLTV and they absolutely murked them. then Sprout who are doing really well right now and the Renegades who arent bad at all. Extra Salt is def on the Rebound and its good to see for NA
[4:51:55] <BizarreMark> OOOO ns
[4:52:05] <blanplam> @glaizeeee ok ty
[4:52:11] <td_gg> the best way to sustain a pro scene in a region is to maintain a healthy casual player base. if valve tried to make a push to appeal to NA players it would go a long way to improve the pro scene
[4:52:11] <DIkktudo> do you think astralis will become the best EU team again?
[4:52:16] <Achapman18> hugs widepeepoHappy

[4:53:07] <Tarnixx> Chat is this semi's or finals?
[4:53:10] <moosE3knucklE> @DIkktudo oh yeah. BlameF and K0nfig on a team with Gla1ve.... Astralis will utilize K0nfig like Magisk and i think K0nfig is better than Magisk was
[4:53:12] <Cymatics_> Blast with the fresh content, they are doing better than pgl
[4:53:18] <bigfani> its the finals

[5:26:15] <vtec_kicked_in__yo> So I should stop buying bizons you're saying????
[5:26:21] <aunathons> this is why i buy negev fl0m. if i have enough bullet to cover all 1920x1080 pixels i cant miss
[5:26:21] <peakzGG> I think the meta is pretty balanced atm but the m4a1s is actually broken
[5:26:26] <billballbowl> I feel like having more bullets is ideal in certain situations.... I switch to A4 if I'm playing pit on inferno for example
[5:26:27] <GiraffePig> The game is to NaVi sided right now, need balance

[5:32:56] <ashen21> fuck the sg
[5:32:57] <1amdaredevil> what about the riot shield, fl0m?
[5:32:57] <DEETLEJUICE> aint nobody tryna play cod bruh
[5:32:58] <ongcugia1> I loved the SG man Sadge
[5:32:58] <td_gg> should the A1 go to 3000 and the A4 go to 2 900?
[5:32:59] <bapetiBUPI> i wish we could buy both m4a4 and m4a1-s during a game
[5:33:00] <DrIsaac> playing T side nuke in 2014 OMEGALUL
[5:33:00] <ashen21> all my homies hate the sg
[5:33:01] <Bob0_s> how many channel points to get fl0m a night with Shox?
[5:33:02] <jtrix1875_> the SG was so much fun for me but it was far too good :D
[5:33:02] <SukksGaming> galil doesnt even have a burst mode Kappa
[5:33:06] <btr1242> I loved the sg LUL
[5:33:07] <Gittawat_> @fl0m  spectre run n gun is king in valorant :)
[5:33:07] <ShawnMCS_> bro watching AK 1 taps are so much more fun than fuckign SGs
[5:33:07] <peakzGG> mac-10 > Galil
[5:33:08] <cr4zydavey> sg meta was dark times
[5:33:11] <Tarnixx> KEKW
[5:33:12] <bobongtalong> why not just ban nuke?
[5:33:13] <A_GT86> but buying a4 and a1 at the same time would be greeat
[5:33:14] <bolottekid> KEKW
[5:33:15] <hunter6925> what about m249 @fl0m
[5:33:16] <ap0stle21> b1t is sad he is not getting frags , no mvp
[5:33:16] <dotalegendery2> 100% bullet pen aswell
[5:33:22] <ongcugia1> NIKO DOES LULW
[5:33:23] <TacticalAlmonds> it was awful when cts got the sg
[5:33:24] <c0rkmcnortis> fl0m thoughts on mixing up the smg meta? can we make the bizon 1tap for like a day?
[5:33:24] <btr1242> Spray pattern was too fun
[5:33:24] <bolottekid> NERF NEGEV peepoRiot
[5:33:26] <Silkjackel222> 5 CTs with SG's was the worst feeling
[5:33:27] <glaizeeee> sg felt amazing to spray though nail gun go brrrrrrr
[5:33:29] <iehdke> Tabsen
[5:33:32] <Kurintoi> S1mple getting a proposal mid game.
[5:33:35] <A_GT86> but buying a4 and a1 at the same time would be great @fl0m
[5:33:36] <tommysaiami420> tabsen and niko
[5:33:39] <SternXP> it's NIKOs favourite gun lol
[5:33:39] <Aallesklaarr> they have to buff the sg a bit
[5:33:41] <ShawnMCS_> they dont need a buff on T
[5:33:42] <BizarreMark> peepoW I hope they dont
[5:33:42] <dunkinsomedonuts> niko and tabsen use krieg
[5:33:46] <sanchit47> NiKo used it in major final overtime @fl0m
[5:33:49] <GiraffePig> SG was that OP for years and nobody realised cos price
[5:33:50] <Gour204> i'd rather scout than us an sg
[5:33:58] <yungdankdank> what do u think about the d2 change with the no mid peaking from spawn @fl0m
[5:34:06] <dweevers> peepoPat GiraffePig
[5:34:06] <saltyasd> it only took a small price reduction to make the gun op, when before everyone thought it was garbo, don't trust community with balance KEKW
[5:34:09] <lolypop98> make it not oneshot headshot and old firerate
[5:34:10] <glaizeeee> spent hours practicing with sg that when they nerfed it i struggled with ak

[5:55:00] <critians321> misuta seems like he has insane aim but doesnt get many kills in games
[5:55:01] <jgrasp_> dismantling a roster after reaching the champions stage in the major seems a little dumb imo
[5:55:04] <TheHolyDaal> b1t gets 3 1deags here
[5:55:04] <kersting> or was Kyojin the only one
[5:55:05] <impulse_101> just replace kyojin why the fuck would you dismantle this team

[5:55:19] <dunkinsomedonuts> @fl0m what do you think rpk was better on than kyojin
[5:55:28] <Bulleta> no, youd start each round like it was the pistol, death match is totally different than that

[6:03:11] <ShawnMCS_> the CS orgs are some of the only ones who can get these sponsors
[6:03:11] <Mussejusse> did liquid just announce NAF or is that a meme tweet, i really cant tell
[6:03:11] <Uwotm08> Crypto making inroads is making me want to quit watching CS.
[6:03:16] <long_hands_02> imagine what naf can do if you put him on a team that is build around him
[6:03:16] <yobtih> have you seen the way your chat handles channel points? your whole chat are degen gamblers who can't control themselves

[6:29:45] <SaMtHePeRv> ELIGE think its still 2017

[6:29:47] <n9nelashes> except pwn
[6:29:48] <rushil_20> i hope grim lands on a good team @fl0m
[6:29:57] <vchair23> roles wise shox seems dead with naf back
[6:29:58] <ambi3n> I think refrezh is the most underrated player rn
[6:29:58] <critians321> you dont have to develop an awper in the general no?
[6:29:58] <5Rule_> yo i havent heard of that name for years LUL
[6:30:03] <ImTarco> Yeah it seems like teams are no longer willing to take chances on up-and-comers.
[6:30:04] <kersting> I sort of appreciate Liquid for not scalping the other teams right now, cause now we have more solid cores.
[6:30:05] <cow1337kills> @fl0m do you know if stew will start streaming?
[6:30:05] <A_GT86> poison tho?
[6:30:09] <hmminator> @fl0m do you think blade will change cs scene
[6:30:10] <kersting> I know its controversial
[6:30:12] <keegle1> Liquid could sign Fl0m, I`ve heard hes open for negotiations
[6:30:20] <ShawnMCS_> wolfy is banging in tier 2 EU
[6:30:25] <pirateluffydking> Jks to liquid
[6:30:25] <coffee_josh> i wish cs wasnt dead in NA. lol i cant even find a game in the morning on the west coast

[6:30:35] <cr4zydavey> not liquid fault for not wanting to develop someone KEKW
[6:30:36] <dunkinsomedonuts> but apparantely poizon was booted from col because he was very causual about the teams prep like he never watched demos and stuff when the team did
[6:30:37] <Timbot525> @keegle1 fl0m's contract would be 5gited for every kill
[6:30:38] <A_GT86> @keegle1 yeah hes a prodigy
[6:30:43] <imnoahh> @vchair23 nitr0 for fallen is all thats needed and maybe someone else for grim
[6:30:46] <megaganj> if anything i think naf stomping this tourney helped
[6:30:51] <pirateluffydking> jks to liquid
[6:30:56] <keegle1> @keegle1 This is the most true tonight
[6:31:01] <Sealer9> liquid was going to have a frenchman, americans, and brazilians on the same team. they woulda been dead in 2 months
[6:31:02] <A_GT86> poison? @fl0m
[6:31:05] <yu__ng> imnoahh -grim -fallen +auti +nitr0 EZ

[6:54:34] <5Rule_> not clown car, say it right. Clown9 KEKW
[6:54:35] <Terie54> Autimatic was nuts in a random retake server I was in
[6:54:35] <camyo> tsm tim FeelsStrongMan
[6:54:36] <Morde24> Tim won the major then got shafted for 2 years straight
[6:54:38] <klaxon419> The one time I bet 50K channel points on a match its Navi on Nuke on a 20 win streak and theyre fucking losing

[7:53:02] <craigr96> I miss being silver tbh, I had ten times more fun than now as an LEM
[7:53:08] <IcyCucumber420> @Frosteys yep or dont speak
[7:53:11] <iterexet> na you see weird shit like faceit 7 = silver 4
[7:53:16] <Chumbo767> BANKS Pog
[7:53:16] <Morde24> a small selectively bad group of people
[7:53:19] <Bulleta> i dont play enough to rank up
[7:53:20] <Shimshammie> it also gives some explanation
[7:53:21] <420Enigma> POGGERS
[7:53:24] <dorfenklus> and then once I got out of silver I ranked through Gold instantly
[7:53:26] <SuPReMaXzZ> BANKS Pog
[7:53:33] <numb3r_cs> BANKS POGGERS
[7:53:34] <Bowl0fWater> and the tie system is dumb
[7:53:37] <morgan_freeman_but_not> banks widepeepoHappy
[7:53:38] <Frosteys> @IcyCucumber420 yeah its so anoying XD
[7:53:39] <Liberadikal> The thing is, when you get to SEM or Global ranks in EU, its alooot of cheating
[7:53:48] <ash588> ash588 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Pog ?
[7:53:48] <Techno> - ash588 just re-subscribed for 6 months! fl0mPog
[7:53:53] <striegel_> @Bowl0fWater yeah that is really dumb
[7:53:54] <SpykerLOL> so banks is a dedicated  na'vi fan :D
[7:54:00] <dankiyy> but instead new skins Peepo
[7:54:01] <muddychor> i m silver in valorant and take a pride as iron is the lowest rank there
[7:54:02] <ChappieLUX> @Liberadikal in my experience, only if your trust factor is trash
[7:54:03] <PottsnPannz> PottsnPannz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Finally got ranked after watching ya since Valorant beta, got silver 1, thanks for showing me CSGO, and the last like 2 years of content
[7:54:03] <SupraUK_> boombl: get out of my site
[7:54:04] <Techno> - PottsnPannz just re-subscribed for 11 months! fl0mPog
[7:54:06] <downbadceo> I dont think ppl actually try in MM.
[7:54:07] <Gekko125> Cs go should just have seasons that would fix a lot
[7:54:10] <Shimshammie> fuck 128 tick servers...can I get ranks that reflect what's up
[7:54:10] <XeeVzz> 5 AKs monkaS
[7:54:12] <iiTz_Nza> B OOOO M
[7:54:12] <monkkey2> they need to fix the cheater problem
[7:54:15] <HotDishMan> MM is the single biggest part of a game continuing to grow/sustain
[7:54:16] <tander159> that would require Valve to "give a shit"
[7:54:19] <numb3r_cs> valve caring about games other than Dota KEKPOINT
[7:54:21] <MagicMarker1> right Valve has done an awful job with matchmaking
[7:54:22] <thylastfyre> skins are much more important to the game the actual mm @fl0m
[7:54:24] <vinciCS> A good matchmaking system would singlehandedly get me back into CS
[7:54:24] <audio_noodle> boom just having a banger
[7:54:31] <huronvalley21> how do you pronounce Boombla?? Is it Boom Bitch theyre saying?
[7:54:32] <pananatr33> nopers need to fix case drop chance
[7:54:34] <Frosteys> yeah the cheater problem is bad as always. but still better then warzone XD
[7:54:37] <sanchit47> valorant sorted their MM we have to give them that
[7:54:38] <TheRock_as> But how do you fix it? Full reset on everyones rank + different placement and ranking up system?
[7:54:39] <ash588> my tier 1 PepeHands
[7:54:39] <chrisp_baykon> @huronvalley21 boomitch
[7:54:40] <purjetv> EZ

[7:54:56] <HotDishMan> @TheRock_as they have to revamp the anti-cheat heavily
[7:54:56] <Chumbo767> konfig is well served damn Pog
[7:54:57] <rikimaru_xd> s1mple is pissed
[7:54:57] <huronvalley21> ahh ty @chrisp_baykon
[7:55:02] <dankiyy> they are panning every couple at the venue holy
[7:55:03] <hwanzi> if Valve fixed the cheating problem like riot has i would play CS again
[7:55:07] <Xcilentt> Hot
[7:55:09] <stsoul2> boom itch
[7:55:10] <chrisp_baykon> boom bitch 10/10
[7:55:14] <iiTz_Nza> i might start playing csgo again if they fix it
[7:55:16] <huronvalley21> hahah
[7:55:18] <tander159> navi is just peaking everything and not getting punished
[7:55:19] <SpykerLOL> But I personally like MM
[7:55:22] <Achapman18> oh no
[7:55:23] <ash588> wtf
[7:55:24] <striegel_> holy shit
[7:55:25] <TurtlesFly> OOOO
[7:55:25] <ThePooP> the best way to enjoy a csgo game is to play valve mm
[7:55:25] <SupraUK_> 16-1 incoming
[7:55:26] <Achapman18> hes doing the thing
[7:55:26] <Goffefefefe> ok then
[7:55:26] <B_RYE> LUL
[7:55:27] <mystorrr> VAC
[7:55:27] <Durtle02> I have lots of fun in unranked competitive @fl0m
[7:55:27] <SupraUK_> wtf is this
[7:55:28] <Inxter> How do you get 2 there OMEGALUL
[7:55:28] <chrisp_baykon> damn navi is unstoppable
[7:55:28] <kylelokhin> !setting
[7:55:28] <IcyCucumber420> gg
[7:55:29] <fedoralva> DISGUSTING!
[7:55:29] <downbadceo> being 64 tck is a big turn off
[7:55:29] <beerocl0ck> i feel like valve has no fiscal incentive to fix mm, therefore it will not be fixed
[7:55:30] <iam_DJ_> wwtffff
[7:55:30] <schultzymo> Navi is a literal cheat code of a team.... jesus....
[7:55:30] <BooomerNinja> Oh they mad
[7:55:32] <iiTz_Nza> OOOO
[7:55:32] <Hearte_> Ok s1mple
[7:55:32] <ash588> how could he get double kill from there
[7:55:33] <numb3r_cs> how does he get 2!
[7:55:33] <striegel_> how does he win that?
[7:55:36] <ItsAho> They pissed Navi off with nuke
[7:55:37] <CrovvCSGO> Navi lost on nuke though
[7:55:37] <SpykerLOL> with the new addition on short MM it has been a lot more enjoyable for me as a filthy casual
[7:55:38] <Shimshammie> The whole "rank decay" formula isn't working currently. Leetify saying that tons of S2-S5 are like FaceIt 7-9
[7:55:39] <IcyCucumber420> navi is pissed
[7:55:39] <ChappieLUX> @ThePooP hello there fine sir widepeepoHappy
[7:55:41] <Xcilentt> If they have better anti cheat and add 128 tick I’ll play
[7:55:41] <Frosteys> valve is never gonna fix the shitty anti cheat -_- more skins and shit maps. but anti cheat is low prio XD
[7:55:42] <klovnn1> navi speedrunnig inferno
[7:55:42] <TheRock_as> @HotDishMan The anti cheat is good, i dont know why everyone complains about it, just have a good trust factor and thats it

[7:55:48] <fluidfirexx> YEP
[7:55:49] <rikimaru_xd> called it
[7:55:50] <dankiyy> just took them 10 years too long
[7:55:52] <officer_ant> ton of cheaters in unranked for me anyways
[7:55:55] <Morde24> I literally only play short matches or casual nowadays
[7:55:55] <ImTarco> Apex's preaims are actually so satisfying to watch.
[7:55:56] <downbadceo> yeah Sadge
[7:55:59] <Bowl0fWater> it does
[7:56:01] <Chumbo767> they made navi mad monkaS
[7:56:01] <IcyCucumber420> shortmatches are great
[7:56:01] <iam_DJ_> i dont understand how does he win that it doesnt make sense
[7:56:01] <kylelokhin> !sens
[7:56:02] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's in-game settings including his sensitivity: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY?t=26
[7:56:03] <CrovvCSGO> MM Na is also from what i heard a LOT worse than EU
[7:56:03] <SpykerLOL> Short MM is a good new addition to MM
[7:56:03] <hey_itsjean> sometimes unraked is full of tryharding 5 stacks
[7:56:05] <ThePooP> i have not met a cheater in MM for years
[7:56:05] <easternexamination> it does yeah
[7:56:07] <gambinium> I tried a bit of unranked, it's either people with 5h in the game or cheaters
[7:56:08] <dankiyy> unrated should have been in the game since it came out
[7:56:08] <HotDishMan> @TheRock_as but what do people have to suffer through to get a good trust factor as well
[7:56:08] <IcyCucumber420> i like em atleast
[7:56:10] <hobrev> I legit miss the public gaming culture from 1.6 and source, you could make real friendships on public servers
[7:56:11] <TheOnlyWookie> same with faceit honestly
[7:56:12] <DIkktudo> they need an anti cheat system asap
[7:56:12] <adderallstarcs> Farting can be a gamble sometimes @fl0m
[7:56:12] <SupraUK_> i played unranked with a few friends of a friend (i know), i felt really bad for the opposition because it looked like 3 of them were playing for the first time KEKWait
[7:56:15] <axxe112> for me mm is always cancer
[7:56:16] <SuPReMaXzZ> Banks Pog
[7:56:17] <muddychor> @hey_itsjean always
[7:56:18] <Liberadikal> You meet cheaters everywhere, ive encountered cheaters in DM
[7:56:23] <yavin04> i just dont like solo queing faceit so i just suffer in MM
[7:56:24] <monkkey2> yeah, play against novas and get your ass beat. then play against lems and have a good game
[7:56:26] <ItsAho> I had a spinbotter on my team yesterday lol
[7:56:27] <numb3r_cs> that's how i feel playing facit lvl 1 as an EU LE getting stomped or get griefed
[7:56:27] <Rinm> short matchs i like better tbh
[7:56:29] <5thrabbit> I only do short games now just incase so im not locked in for an hour
[7:56:31] <lolypop98> yeah, it's either you get stomped or you stomp the other team
[7:56:34] <Sealer9> bring back community servers
[7:56:35] <SternXP> when I play mm I feel like fl0m cause it always seems like I'm against big fana

[7:56:39] <Durtle02> @fl0m it does kinda feel like a gamble but with the short matches i dont care taking that gamble cause worst case its like 20 mins of frustrating enemies but I can still meme because its unranked
[7:56:45] <IcyCucumber420> thoughts on short matches? @fl0m
[7:56:51] <fluidfirexx> @fl0m is it true that NA MM IS way worse than eu or any other region ? heard a lot of crying from warowl

[7:57:15] <priiide_> nvm they fixed it
[7:57:15] <SquiDI0> there we go
[7:57:16] <doTRONymous> If I have a decent system will increasing from 16gb to 32gb of ram have any effect on my FPS?
[7:57:18] <TheOnlyWookie> valve made sure that community servers dide
[7:57:18] <BooomerNinja> They're all B1t peepoFoil
[7:57:19] <Gour204> i've been trying to teach my friend csgo. its basically impossible with the way MM is. he's to shit for faceit but mm isn't really helping
[7:57:19] <ItsKaribou> all of my games are either all low silvers or a mix of literally every rank
[7:57:20] <Chumbo767> b1t vs b1t Pog
[7:57:21] <a732v> people still like watching players grind for #1
[7:57:22] <Hearte_> Powerpoint map

[7:57:43] <BooomerNinja> EZ 4 S1MPLE
[7:57:44] <ThePooP> there is not that many cheaters in EU supreme/global
[7:57:46] <skippyball_> Hey chat! it is fl0m's BDAY!!! fl0mBirthday fl0mBirthday fl0mBirthday fl0mBirthday fl0mBirthday
[7:57:47] <kylelokhin> 128 ticks server
[7:57:48] <MiraiShikimi> but overwatch is still down so...
[7:57:51] <Seppedc> @fl0m  do u think they are working on a new anti cheat?
[7:57:52] <Achapman18> D:
[7:57:54] <sanchit47> anti cheat should be their priority
[7:57:55] <ap0stle21> i was afk these last rounds , did anything crazy happen?
[7:57:55] <eternal_vision> KEKW
[7:57:56] <dankiyy> no one wants to be the one doing it
[7:57:57] <aain02> LULW
[7:57:58] <hobrev> I think valve is still developing the AI for it
[7:58:02] <CrovvCSGO> Also 128 tick is just... kinda nice @fl0m Thats for myself a big reason why i prefer FACEIT and ESEA
[7:58:02] <kylelokhin> and anti cheat
[7:58:02] <cow1337kills> GOAT
[7:58:03] <BooomerNinja> CS and chill KEKW
[7:58:03] <maskellsamuel> they said not to cheat wdym
[7:58:06] <IcyCucumber420> thye dont have much space in NZ office @fl0m
[7:58:07] <TheOnlyWookie> they would loose a good amount of the playerbase if they had a better anticheat
[7:58:08] <og_breezy> i 5 queue mm and we almost guaranteed a cheater... if u make 1 nice play they assume u cheat and just turn on
[7:58:09] <acey091> CS and chill sounds like a DREAM
[7:58:09] <stsoul2> @doTRONymous cs is majority single core cpu determines fps the gpu will always help but don't go upgrading specifically for fps
[7:58:11] <downbadceo> just hire the faceit guy
[7:58:15] <buddha_pest> honestly the problem in NA is that matchmaking is broken - LEs against silvers happens way way too much
[7:58:16] <TheRock_as> PogU
[7:58:17] <TurtlesFly> CONDOM MAN!!!
[7:58:17] <TBagCS> 128 tick more than anti-cheat I almost get no cheaters at all
[7:58:18] <Mini_Mang> people still just leave turn the shit on and reconnect to the  match
[7:58:21] <marine5014> on EU cheaters stop around mg so it's fun in mm imo, have only seen cheaters in casual lately
[7:58:21] <dankiyy> 128 is QOL nowadays
[7:58:23] <mamluku> a valve dev has a phd and a H index over 70, h index over 20 is a success @fl0m
[7:58:24] <priiide_> 128 tick is nice but not 100% necessary
[7:58:26] <hemo_tox> Why would people cheat in Counter-Strike when they have specifically been requested not to?!?!?!

[8:01:00] <NBradley40> when i learned 64 tick and 128 tick are differnent lineups i stoped trying to learn\pay attention to them during peoples streams and matches. i learned a handful for mirage and gave up NotLikeThis
[8:01:01] <striegel_> @vinciCS LUL
[8:01:01] <wazzelouf> @dbleday delusional

[8:01:22] <ChappieLUX> OMEGALUL
[8:01:23] <bzy86> in EU i feel the cheating has become less of a problem
[8:01:23] <Achapman18> POGGIES
[8:01:25] <axxe112> @Gekko125 how you know ?
[8:01:27] <dbleday> I love butter so therefore I root for the French here
[8:01:29] <kvippp> zywooo! POG
[8:01:30] <yobtih> but you're cheating
[8:01:30] <SpykerLOL> He is just tooo goooodddd
[8:01:32] <ash588> zywoo read them like a book
[8:01:33] <SupraUK_> i was gonna say, 80% is rather very low
[8:01:38] <Kado_CS> na mm is actually the worst experience possible
[8:01:38] <Achapman18> ok Zywoo
[8:01:42] <TBagCS> Cheating is very rare now
[8:01:45] <shadypc> thats why i think leaderboard and stats would be dope... players would have something to grind for
[8:01:45] <HeyKroZ_> Clapgers  just too good
[8:01:46] <SupraUK_> our cheaters are more diluted
[8:01:46] <priiide_> namel OMEGALUL ck
[8:01:47] <IcyCucumber420> used kenny too
[8:01:47] <CrovvCSGO> Zywoo is turning up now lol
[8:01:49] <SupraUK_> that is all
[8:01:52] <Liberadikal> @dbleday Thats the best reason hahaha
[8:01:53] <Bulleta> maybe if i win about 6 games in a row in a day ill rank up
[8:01:54] <TheOnlyWookie> @TBagCS you are naive
[8:01:57] <lettuce2x> what was the score line for nuke?
[8:01:58] <IcyCucumber420> more people yeah
[8:02:00] <SupraUK_> !ey
[8:02:02] <SupraUK_> !eu
[8:02:02] <Nightbot> EU MM is easier because it works as intended. NA MM is more difficult because there's a higher proportion of cheaters and rank disparities make games difficult due to a smaller player base.
[8:02:04] <hey_itsjean> yeah
[8:02:04] <DesireGuy> shouldnt the percentage of scums be the same tho?
[8:02:05] <Bob0_s> @fl0m really talkin about Dilution rn
[8:02:05] <Rinm> 100% cheater lol if anyone headtaps us
[8:02:09] <FyrHydrant> the cheaters a lot more diluted in eu for sure
[8:02:11] <TBagCS> @theonlywookie ah ok genius. Thanks

[8:02:47] <Lun4t1c_csgo> how do u choose to play on eu? with vpn?
[8:02:47] <papadiaj> gold nova is kinda a sweet spot in NA, i have only seen a couple cheaters in like 300+ games
[8:02:47] <mystorrr> most cheaters are using the same cheat

[8:05:12] <Achapman18> i thought you were talking about Auti lol
[8:05:12] <cow1337kills> Theres a line though being toxic killed Ninja's 100k viewers a day
[8:05:12] <Kado_CS> @DesireGuy kind of but given there are significantly less players in na mm you're more likely to queue against the same people over and over rather than getting a brand new set of players and potentially not playing against a cheater
[8:05:14] <kersting> it took his hair

[8:06:13] <Chumbo767> this was such a deja vu
[8:06:14] <ShawnMCS_> it could go so well or could be so poor

[8:06:52] <Mccoone> no one should have to download face it to just play the game
[8:07:05] <TappinGuts> It’s like the time you played cs with Hiko a few months ago. You guys queued into cheaters for 4 games and hiko was out lol

[8:08:33] <quuqua> Simple can you ask my gf to marry me - boombl4
[8:08:34] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m so we played in EU MM last night. EU MM is ass. like they're really not good at the game. playing GN3-DMGs and they all felt like silvers
[8:08:36] <code_seren> 1g was a good meme until everyone used it whenever someone died to a molly

[8:09:10] <SupraUK_> KEKW
[8:09:11] <jackx14> simple actully is not normally
[8:09:12] <Lekr0DeRuS> vitality take nuke just to do this
[8:09:12] <Maskoliar> @code_seren, 1g was a good meme because it propelled Summit as a streamer
[8:09:17] <Lekr0DeRuS> KEKW
[8:09:19] <ElaD_O> Navi really pissed about losing their nuke stream ah?
[8:09:19] <so4pybox> thats why everyone should stop comparing val and cs because what one doesnt have the other one does
[8:09:21] <SethFrost_> I miss money 10mans in CS FeelsBadMan
[8:09:22] <TheRock_as> oh
[8:09:23] <vzylexy> TenZ?!

[8:09:26] <Jay_rb> THIS IS NOT NORMALLY

[8:09:38] <billballbowl> @STatisfacti0n thanks
[8:09:42] <easternexamination> tenZ BatChest
[8:09:44] <audio_noodle> @fl0m the way s1mple's hand shakes after flicks scares me
[8:09:51] <Durtle02> @STatisfacti0n play with an EU player, have your max ping at 250 and the EU player at like 50 max ping
[8:09:52] <Chumbo767> tenz BatChest
[8:09:58] <sendaeran> what's your opinion on a more intrusive AC in MM? everyone claims to want it, but I wonder if that comes from ignorance of the security risk, or just a willingness to accept it
[8:09:59] <STatisfacti0n> that too
[8:10:03] <stsoul2> is a valorant 10 man just people arguing who can insta lock Jet?
[8:10:12] <kayyyyyy____> yes
[8:10:12] <ShawnMCS_> OOOO
[8:10:13] <Liberadikal> But if the danes go to vitality, isnt that a big problem since zywoo doesnt speak english?
[8:10:14] <JxFriz> I used to help organize CS 10mans and it is HELL
[8:10:15] <Lekr0DeRuS> well that would explain it
[8:10:17] <Lun4t1c_csgo> u cant play valo on faceit?

[8:10:38] <Sqwidders> @Doccy annytfKiss
[8:10:40] <Lun4t1c_csgo> why the game is there then?
[8:10:42] <Doccy> riot does not allow for 3rd party matchmaking systems
[8:10:43] <chrisp_baykon> ohno isnt shox coming to liquid adrenR adrenR adrenR adrenR
[8:10:44] <so4pybox> can you believe that zywoo uses space bar to jump
[8:10:52] <Achapman18> good english too
[8:10:52] <Doccy> or anything 3rd party really
[8:10:53] <som2999> 4 not enough on ferno
[8:10:53] <vinciCS> sendaeran its probably ignorance and most people really don't evaluate the risks. Look at valorant, so many people hopped on and just sold their soul to the anti cheat
[8:10:53] <Hearte_> No way riot hands over that control
[8:10:54] <STatisfacti0n> zywoo actually speaks surprisingly good english now

[8:11:50] <numb3r_cs> @so4pybox what??
[8:11:54] <sendaeran> @vincics I feel the same. and a company as large as valve would be insane to open themselves up to that amount of risk
[8:11:55] <freeman986> @fl0m apex and magisk might get in a fight
[8:11:58] <BonBonVal> @Doccy update on case? U keeping it after all?

[8:14:06] <Doccy> it was storms
[8:14:07] <freeman986> Imagine, vitality is losing, and apex starts shouting, then magisk loses his chill and starts hitting apex
[8:14:07] <striegel_> the loe "Zywoo go kill" strat
[8:14:09] <sendaeran> @vincics I don't disagree, I'd be willing to accept it. but the issue people either ignore or don't realize is that millions of people have cs in their library, even if they don't play it. if they install the update, their pc is potentially at risk with a kernel AC.
[8:14:12] <CrovvCSGO> @so4pybox English isnt actually very hard.
[8:14:12] <Doccy> flooding is here
[8:14:12] <hwanzi> anything is better than VAC
[8:14:14] <Doccy> stripSuffer
[8:14:15] <abdo_2_> VAC cmonBruh
[8:14:16] <chrisp_baykon> @so4pybox French and their words with gender were a bitch to learn
[8:14:18] <AFskillz> 3 rounds won, all bcz of ywoo...
[8:14:18] <Zola1712> @fl0m You noticed that whoever starts CT side wins the map?
[8:14:20] <MaxofMine> To be fair, that is a really low bar to clear
[8:14:21] <officer_ant> vac is the screen door of anti cheats
[8:14:25] <SuprenDe> maybe VAC would be better, even without being intrusive, if Valve actually cared @fl0m
[8:14:29] <MagicMarker1> $5 cheats work just fine
[8:14:32] <mystorrr> theyre using invite only cheats
[8:14:33] <fluidfirexx> i only had 2 cheats in 255 matches on faceit

[8:14:38] <retiiful> @Doccy itll kill the 20 foot spiders for you
[8:14:40] <fluidfirexx> cheaters*
[8:14:40] <vinciCS> sendaeran thats fair. I think what fl0m described would be a good middleground
[8:14:41] <audio_noodle> @fl0m vac doesn't even care about programs that literally read depth data etc from the game
[8:14:44] <Lun4t1c_csgo> how often do u run into a cheater in faceit on eu region?
[8:14:44] <quuqua> fl0m dont forget about vacnet.. AI that sends cheaters to overwatch (not the game)
[8:14:47] <BadBrad1K> Theres a reason we have r/VACsucks and not r/FaceitAnticheatSucks
[8:14:47] <mimis_21> KEKW man is preying to a higher power for VIT to have a chance

[8:14:57] <Lockerific> @fl0m Just make players pinky promise <3
[8:14:58] <monkkey2> agreed

If these are the types of mods (and consequently goes higher up in food chain and extends to fl0m), give me permaban and I won't even bother watching this stream ever again.
