[1:18:56] <Destructoid5858> Dear Mr Flom, I am a valued subscriber to your beloved #139 Twitch channel and I am confused when you tell people that they are "fun at parties". You say that angrily and never invite these fine lads to a party. If you'd think they would be fun then you should host a party and invite them.

[2:30:24] <l3ordon> I saw fl0m at the store the other day, he saw me knock over a whole shelf of adult diapers. He said "oh man, that's so sad. can we get five gifted?".  Originally I laughed, but he ignored me until I opened up the Twitch app on my phone and gifted the five.  He proceeded to pull some sort of mug from his ass and wave it in my face,  saying "hey anon, thanks for the five mcgifties" and complemented my penis.

[2:32:31] <sevengaming_tv> You can say that I was born to be a Twitch channel mod. I catch a glimpse of copypasta, the adrenaline starts pumping. A whiff of drama, I snap into duty. My streamer calls for a chat ban, I erase that motherfucker from the history books of this channel. There is no !command I won’t code, no timeout I won’t give, no Twitch laws I won’t overlook, and no order I won’t obey to make my streamer happy. And if you become his problem, well, I’m sorry to say that I’ll become yours.

[2:43:42] <random_factz> Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Hitboy’s Hairline. My thesis is that Hitboy’s Hairline is receding by almost an inch every day. As an instinctive response, this makes Hitboy mad which supports my conclusion that Hitboy is in fact malding. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.  fl0mSmorting
