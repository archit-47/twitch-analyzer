[8:17:48] <TitanxAU> if im grim id be pissed about this
[8:17:55] <elcheer> you can have an opinion 👍
[8:18:04] <Inthe1> I just hate it's before an event
[8:18:10] <XteriorGaming> You think Stew stays NA or goes on an EU team?

[8:18:18] <elcheer> so interviews happen and get published
[8:18:23] <r_udra> peepoSit
[8:18:32] <LowRatedHighlander> stew even goes deeper in twitter saying that grim is top NA talent and reiterates that grim came into a broken team into the wrong role
[8:18:35] <nolsygg> I think this is a very fair interview tbh, gives us lot great insight & shows that the issues had multiple layers that all came together to cause issues
[8:18:49] <LowRatedHighlander> people are just picking specific sentences and not focusing on the message as a whole KEKW
[8:19:02] <vchair23> streamer not used to reading
[8:19:03] <elcheer> @LowRatedHighlander that's par for the course tbh
[8:19:05] <florusRL> I like that stew is being honest, hes just honest about whats happening, nothing is a personal attack. The only thing that would bother me would be if grim saw this before the event
[8:19:10] <Deifur1> Sound like NA is missing ODEAG :/
[8:19:23] <Just_Melo> Built to win? LUL
[8:19:37] <Sunnycss> NA is missing OCEAN KEKW
[8:19:39] <LowRatedHighlander> elcheer its like the only sentence they read was "stew said grim was all aim no brain omg so much shade ooooooo"
[8:19:57] <JR_Hopkins> the gambits and vp can pop up out of no where
[8:20:03] <elcheer> average csgo article reader reads a headline and 2 sentences and makes a verdict on that alone
[8:20:15] <Just_Melo> In short NA has no hope widepeepoSad
