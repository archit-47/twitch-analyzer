[3:05:16] <gxxky> I was going to school for English Education when i was in college and they made me take and Algebra and Trig class
[3:05:21] <gxxky> failed the shit out of it
[3:05:30] <jaomania> In US?
[3:05:33] <gxxky> yes
[3:05:33] <jaomania> or different country
[3:05:35] <jaomania> yea
[3:05:42] <jaomania> US edu is slightly fucked
[3:05:52] <LeBoomstickPBP> “Slightly”
[3:06:00] <zThrice> we  are dum af
[3:06:06] <gxxky> i mean it was just a GenEd for the degree and it was only the one class
[3:06:09] <jaomania> I AM DUM
[3:06:12] <LeBoomstickPBP> And our education is the cost of a house nowadays
[3:06:15] <gxxky> and I like to suck dick sometimes which means I cannot do math
[3:06:17] <LeBoomstickPBP> Well, a small house
[3:06:22] <jaomania> Idk if its just me but i just fail at classes that focus on memorization
[3:06:27] <jaomania> like i cant memorize
[3:06:35] <gxxky> idk if you've looked at the housing market these days boomstick
[3:06:35] <LeBoomstickPBP> Nah you’re not alone
[3:06:35] <jaomania> im good at math but fuck is it hard
[3:06:46] <gxxky> but unless you go private or live in wyoming houses are way more expensive
[3:06:51] <jaomania> like what happened to SOHCAHTOA
[3:06:55] <jaomania> much simpler times
[3:06:58] <zThrice> if youre math teacher is making you memorize things then hopefully they allow equations on exams
[3:07:04] <LeBoomstickPBP> I got taught that in high school actually haha
[3:07:05] <gxxky> geometry was kind of poggers
[3:07:15] <jaomania> nah our teacher doesnt even teach

[3:07:19] <jaomania> like i kid u not
[3:07:24] <LeBoomstickPBP> Just spouts.
[3:07:26] <LeBoomstickPBP> ?
[3:07:31] <jaomania> she sends the notes for homework and homework for classwork
[3:07:33] <jaomania> it is fucked
[3:07:41] <jaomania> the school literally pulled her out of retirement
[3:07:43] <gxxky> the people that were in the education track at my school also were a reason i dropped out
[3:07:44] <zThrice> rip
[3:07:54] <gxxky> a lot of people who want to teach have no idea how to teach
[3:07:56] <gxxky> or learn
[3:08:01] <jaomania> idk man
[3:08:01] <gxxky> which is like the first step of teaching
[3:08:08] <zThrice> the best teachers dont teach because there is no money
[3:08:14] <LeBoomstickPBP> True
[3:08:17] <jaomania> i heard ivy education sucks because the teachers are there for research and thats ti
[3:08:21] <jaomania> not to teach the class
[3:08:23] <zThrice> if teachers made 100k a year they would mostly be VERY good
[3:08:23] <gxxky> not entirely true
[3:08:36] <Coisher> f2
[3:08:40] <jaomania> well hopefully not
[3:08:50] <jaomania> Princeton charges like 80k
[3:08:51] <gxxky> the ivy league thing is probably true
[3:08:54] <jaomania> that shit is unimagineable
[3:09:02] <gxxky> and most of those profs are like tenured and probably dont care anyway
[3:09:06] <hokieboy01> borpaLicker
[3:09:12] <jaomania> Exactly
