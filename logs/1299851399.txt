Taking out or completely redoing (which has been done so many times so not viable) would make it so much more well rounded

[2:47:25] <nrg_relyt> I’d like a new map but ancient is pretty new
[2:47:25] <quote_if_4_man_save> every 30 seconds a random player explodes, very subtle
[2:47:26] <LucidR9> yeah fl0m no one would ever use a door to open and close, that's unrealistic, might fit in valorant tho
[2:47:26] <supra_nightmare> @fl0m i honestly hate mirage's choke points onto sites its brutal
[2:47:28] <Speedrulez> how are you mr BOP @theHovnival
[2:47:28] <Demea_> door through mid that only opens when you donate 5 gifted
[2:47:30] <whitechocolate64> @fl0m what if they just put a bench in mid? would that fix train?
[2:47:32] <sleeeeppyyyy> F1niteCS chillin
[2:47:34] <SoporificPanda> they should add a circle that if you don't stay inside you slowly lose health
[2:47:39] <theHovnival> @speedrulez I'm fine. How are you.
[2:47:40] <ayunaz> like for example monster closes when the train comes
[2:47:44] <1KERY> thats for sure you dont need 3 site and a one hallway to T from CT.
[2:47:45] <Speedrulez> @theHovnival MmmHmm

[3:09:10] <Arrivall> You can get a real gamer lean going when you angle it KEKW
[3:09:13] <mk_48> wait what KEKW
[3:09:15] <BeauxGnar> its easier to hit right side of board with thumb if angled
[3:09:20] <Psama007> It’s better ergonomics as well

[5:37:49] <1nduni> If REZ can figure his shit out, NIP would scale up so much

[5:39:55] <hobrev> swedish scene had a pretty big exodus to valorant, just on the level below fnatic and NiP
[5:39:57] <silviu_cs> @LowRatedHighlander Strange situation
[5:40:00] <Bakker2583> get brollan off fnatic because they arent winning trophies
[5:40:04] <hobrev> so the youth scene suffered
[5:40:10] <justdanny> its hampus but he wants to IGL
[5:40:11] <dreamshadow0> fl0m JW building the next swedish team
[5:40:13] <xKimper> do they show who banned what maps?
[5:40:13] <BSODslayer> ... and then we built a bridge and all the talent just slid across the Øresund... Mwahahahaa DatSheffy 🇩🇰
[5:40:14] <CheapPizzaBox> sign glave to nip so hampus can be the star rifler instead of igl and he knows how to use device
[5:40:20] <LowRatedHighlander> @silviu_cs not really on that front they all no pretty decent english.
[5:40:23] <dankiyy> all the swedish youth is in val now kek
[5:40:23] <CheapPizzaBox> pipe dream but could work
[5:40:24] <LowRatedHighlander> Know
[5:40:25] <purpleslinky7> His name is KRIMZ
[5:40:33] <ScoutPack151> I love how people think they people can just get out of contracts whenever they ask
[5:40:38] <kooshyy> wait mouz picked verti
[5:40:41] <Bakker2583> like brollan is nuts he needs a better team
[5:40:41] <YogJr> Don’t blame the young guys for going to val tbh
[5:40:42] <LowRatedHighlander> @cheappizzabox hell no hampus is a great igl too
[5:40:45] <random_memer_> What would have happened if fanatic took dev1ce?
[5:40:46] <oblivion0608> maybe they need to give more time and space to the academy players from young ninjas
[5:40:49] <RexActa> Theres that new draken mix
[5:40:51] <小鯊魚朋友> imagine UK fnatic ends up higher ranked than NIP with devve

[5:41:03] <oblivion0608> so then they could do what mouz did and promote later on
[5:41:04] <silviu_cs> @LowRatedHighlander I can imagine, but if you're gonna comm in English why not go international since the Swedish players are underperforming
[5:41:09] <firenerdd> Y'all think monesy is gonna live up to his hype?

[5:42:03] <kooshyy> has device said anything about his return yet?
[5:42:03] <CheapPizzaBox> @LowRatedHighlander he is but idk maybe im just dumb but wouldnt him not being igl give him even more space to play even better as a rifler
[5:42:03] <ScoutPack151> @hobrev bro device was still easily the best player, don't demote him.
[5:42:03] <Bakker2583> m0nesy might become the next es3tag. might just be good in the moment
[5:42:05] <deathcapz> @firenerdd I think he'll be good enough for G2 to be able to win trophies
[5:42:05] <supra_nightmare> ok now lets take it easy calling device a "Star" ....
[5:42:10] <papadiaj> NIP missed big on magisk and dupreeh, one of them would make a big difference i feel
[5:42:15] <xKimper> i think m0nesy might fold under the pressure of being the next big name
[5:42:24] <YogJr> @bakker2583 he’s got 5x the amount of talent and he’s 16

[5:42:56] <LowRatedHighlander> @cheappizzabox I think it would be more beneficial to just have a stat rifler like fl0m says. He’s a fantastic igl lurk and he just needs support from the other riflers to relieve his position a bit
[5:42:59] <thomas14rax> I think Device shhould have been placed a bit lower
[5:43:16] <kcerwniart> 12-9 nip :x
[5:43:19] <YogJr> Devices stats were insane considering everything
[5:43:22] <Bakker2583> dev1ce will always be top 3
[5:43:24] <kooshyy> @fl0m who should nip get? star rifle
[5:43:25] <XtraLemons> i dont really follow CS but wasnt Device top 3 in the world for a long ass time?

[5:44:01] <LowRatedHighlander> Dev1ce had a rough year mentally when he moved to NIP

[5:44:07] <Immortal1zed> @d0zerCS MLADY
[5:44:09] <YogJr> Mr. Consistent
[5:44:14] <dankiyy> this was probably one of devves worst years. doesnt mean he did bad
[5:44:15] <BSODslayer> To be fair tho', I feel like a good chunk of what let devve go and unleash that talent was the not-visible-in-stats aspects of Astralis, regardless of their decline or not... Fanboy disclaimer, obvs... 😅
[5:44:17] <LowRatedHighlander> I think if he can overcome that he comes back to form
[5:44:21] <spinround> sometimes your team is just too heavy man
[5:44:22] <CheapPizzaBox> @LowRatedHighlander yeah i think youre right he has tons of impact as an igl so if they had a star rifler then that would mak nip fantastic
[5:44:25] <SukksGaming> Rumors had it dev1ce isnt playing because he is the stunt double for Tom Cruise peepoFoil
[5:44:25] <d0zerCS> spotted outside of discord Immortal1zed PepeLaugh

[5:44:35] <小鯊魚朋友> moved to Sweden for nip and gf then gets dumped and nip ends up being hotdog water, truly unfortunate

[5:44:44] <AncientAngel_86> Device is really good it's just he's not flashy like simple or Zywoo so people think he's rated too highly
[5:44:58] <thomas14rax> I still don't understand what Plopski Lnz and Esetag do and used to do
[5:44:58] <akZei> lau is too funny

[6:03:58] <LowRatedHighlander> @patrick_mirus pls don’t
[6:04:01] <LucidR9> yeah but also on a serious note that should be a TOS violation
[6:04:03] <muddychor> do u watch formula 1
[6:04:04] <LucidR9> to have emotes like that
[6:04:14] <1KERY> @yourducky it was a seizure generator right there
[6:04:19] <orhan263> who is the EG igl?
[6:04:22] <xstevennnn> stew
[6:04:26] <suggard> NBK 5-18 FeelsBadMan But still performs if necessary FeelsGoodMan
[6:04:28] <Mentalstatemike> stew

[6:04:42] <twennyNumbers> speedr25L mike
[6:04:43] <LucidR9> help me
[6:04:45] <xstevennnn> rush is the best teammate in NA
[6:04:45] <tsauc3> Maybe if they get ska and Tarik they could win a major?
[6:04:45] <random_memer_> Kennys?
[6:04:45] <hobrev> this tec9 skin tho
[6:04:45] <Y0ungb1> Gamba
[6:04:46] <kooshyy> are eg in katowice
[6:04:46] <muddychor> rush is like a solid wall
[6:04:49] <Gener1cGamer> @fl0m i hope EG at least TRIED to snag osee before liquid got to him, also, taric over brehze maybe???
[6:04:53] <yourducky> https://7tv.app/emotes/60e01c69dd6a810dd4b47ed3 this is twenny 1000%
[6:04:53] <leon_420_> @LucidR9 fl0mTOS
[6:04:53] <ShadeAndBade> @fl0m yeah its actually pretty surprising that tim and rush performed so well
[6:04:54] <gedzz> i firmly believe eg could be a seriously good team
[6:04:56] <Mentalstatemike> twenny no1LOVE
[6:04:59] <Treefi> Dexter bug play
[6:05:01] <PACK_M4N> why doesn't stew stream very much? but he plays pugs with his friends.
[6:05:02] <Treefi> Big
[6:05:02] <kcerwniart> impactful kills the scoreline matters less now
[6:05:05] <justiey> do you think stew is a good igl? he got alot of hate for it when he was doing it on liquid
[6:05:05] <gedzz> but i kinda feel like brehze was more inconsisten in the debut than cerq
[6:05:07] <Ble1d> 5 IMPACT FRAGS
[6:05:08] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKW ducky
[6:05:09] <Ble1d> = 45 kills
[6:05:10] <LowRatedHighlander> Trueeee

[6:05:13] <twennyNumbers> das a good one ducky MmmHmm
[6:05:14] <kooshyy> and malek
[6:05:14] <gedzz> cerq has moments but he always has moments
[6:05:18] <Treefi> Impact of the game wooooo
[6:05:27] <muddychor> tim got helped from valorant while nbk didnt play valorant so he didnt improve in cs KEKW

[7:02:58] <KraKy_3> @fl0m Do I have to share sub to count towards the sub goal?
[7:02:58] <CrovvCSGO> I like that the 2 best players for Mouz is JDC and Torszi though. And Frozen etc. isnt even playing bad.
