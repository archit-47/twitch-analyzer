[2:34:51] <Justhoohaa> who are we watching. my internet is so bad I can't read the name
[2:34:51] <fl1pdof> KEKW
[2:34:55] <STatisfacti0n> certainly looks like a waller at times
[2:34:57] <Archit47> pepeSus
[2:34:57] <ShrapTy> how does he have no fear when scaling site
[2:34:57] <gonzocc> @adijash it's not that weird to aim in the middle of where 2 angles might pop up
[2:34:58] <pad4paris> pepeSus
[2:35:00] <TheMinnesotaGamer> So far in an overwatch he is safe to me.
[2:35:06] <fl1pdof> pepeSus what did you just do and prefire
[2:35:06] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m juice and sauce are jealous he is better than them paapoWeird
[2:35:08] <ShrapTy> he just scales site looking one direction
[2:35:10] <imunboundd> THE TIMING pepeHands
[2:35:14] <STatisfacti0n> I have to say, it almost looks like he's trying to hide it though, right? like he's aware when he shouldn't be but then he kinda does stupid peeks to try and hide it
[2:35:14] <LowRatedHighlander> @justhoohaa i Dani’s I think
[2:35:15] <soyungregorio> he's using 64 ticks smokes, wtf
[2:35:16] <SICK0> what are the odds i go to the clips section now and see people clipping this
[2:35:18] <fl1pdof> Insaniaa @Justhoohaa
[2:35:19] <LowRatedHighlander> Fucking auto correct
[2:35:22] <adzno> Turn off XRay and it might be easier to tell
[2:35:23] <ItsAho> He's weird but not that weird
[2:35:25] <LowRatedHighlander> What fl1p said
[2:35:28] <Sirius_0069> I don't think he is cheating but what do I know
[2:35:32] <Krims0n__> he's really aware...
[2:35:32] <JuhJesse> He doesn’t play like I play, but I suck so who knows :)
[2:35:33] <STatisfacti0n> like a wide swing on cat there?
[2:35:33] <nuke_cs> SICK0 somewhere above 100%
[2:35:34] <pDawgCS> bro fuck this dude's profile
[2:35:34] <buckandbang> nobody, I repeat nobody (except for wallers) aims like that
[2:35:35] <Archit47> what is going on there
[2:35:35] <STatisfacti0n> that's weird
[2:35:36] <dakota_runs> ???????

[2:35:48] <juiceboy2014> That was what i was talkin about
[2:35:50] <yungcong> monkaW
[2:35:52] <adzno> @fl0m I swear turning off Xray helps.
[2:35:52] <memecabinetdan> didn't even jiggle apps or short
[2:35:53] <juiceboy2014> that shot righ there
[2:35:53] <d4ngr_tv> meh that wasn't sus
[2:35:58] <jakkyy> bro he just shit on me
[2:35:59] <m4lki3r> He was first into B and doesnt check Get_Right?
[2:36:03] <jakkyy> NAH FUCK THAT I WANT MY REMATCH
[2:36:06] <LowRatedHighlander> Wait show again
[2:36:09] <STatisfacti0n> he has a lot of confidence at times when he shouldn't, that's why it leads me to think he's cheating
[2:36:09] <Justhoohaa> never played with this guy.
[2:36:11] <inf1nityyyyyy> kinda sus sussy
[2:36:13] <Miljus> it was sus but it can happen
[2:36:17] <soyungregorio> he don't clean anything
[2:36:18] <nicksucksattwitch> tickrate of demo as well
[2:36:20] <sleeeeppyyyy> that wasnt sus. teammate died from there, didnt he?
[2:36:21] <STatisfacti0n> and seems to have some sort of knowledge of angles to look when he has no intel
[2:36:23] <cloutburstgg> yeah i missed that lol
[2:36:23] <Archit47> I am watching bench if I go out short
[2:36:25] <Archit47> not the left
[2:36:28] <d4ngr_tv> looked like he panic flicked but that might be GOTV i dunno
[2:36:29] <adijash> thats an angle no player on earth prefires
[2:36:30] <Archit47> like that dude pepeSus
[2:36:33] <jibbadee> run it back
[2:36:35] <BizarreMark> monkaHmm
[2:36:41] <adzno> fl0mSmorting
[2:36:42] <TheAverageGoob> he keeps the enemies close in his view through the walls
[2:36:48] <ninjapnda11_> monkaHmmm
[2:36:51] <STatisfacti0n> just swings out on cat though
[2:36:53] <STatisfacti0n> no shoulder peek
[2:36:54] <memecabinetdan> the problem is that he doesn't even consider a short or apps player
[2:36:54] <cloutburstgg> yeah hahaha the fuck
[2:36:57] <STatisfacti0n> no real clearing of angles
[2:36:57] <m4lki3r> Doesnt check window, doesnt check getright
[2:37:00] <d4ngr_tv> thats not a pre-aim though lol
[2:37:03] <STatisfacti0n> just swings and flicks to the guy
[2:37:05] <kunju99> he cheating??
[2:37:06] <yungcong> WeirdEyes
[2:37:09] <ShrapTy> his preaim and scaling makes no sense
[2:37:14] <cloutburstgg> yeah hmm WeirdEyes
[2:37:15] <TheMinnesotaGamer> he went to look at mid pillar lol
[2:37:21] <Miljus> he said someting on voice check it
[2:37:25] <adzno> STatisfacti0n I think this one came down to luck honestly. CT wasnt looking at Cat and was like 80% out of cover
[2:37:25] <jakkyy> 76 hs
[2:37:29] <jakkyy> 76%
[2:37:30] <ShrapTy> if we were talking about a level 3 player this would be different
[2:37:35] <Quick_Lets_Run> he saw him before moving crosshair to bench?
[2:37:35] <Miljus> check voice cuz he was saying someting\
[2:37:36] <Nightbot> Latest video: What the Voice Comms during a 99 Kill CS:GO Match Sounds Like! - https://youtu.be/vQnHqcabWwQ
[2:37:40] <sauceboy2012> just look how awful he is at jiggling and peeking angles lol

[2:37:46] <gonzocc> so which is it? walls? aim? both?
[2:37:47] <caretaker447> he doesnt clear apps or van, and like you said he doesnt pre aiming.... Sus
[2:37:55] <Archit47> sauceboy2012 very sus NODDERS
[2:37:55] <STatisfacti0n> @adzno but the thing is, he has confidence when he shouldn't and manages to get it to work out for him which a lot of times is indicative of a waller
[2:37:55] <BizarreMark> monkaW but could just be a average mirage player
[2:37:56] <amutantcookie> paapoWeird
[2:37:57] <AverageJadex> sometimes you just get shitter luck
[2:37:59] <Miljus> check voice cuz he was talking someting when he killed him
[2:38:00] <SICK0> what is he clearing
[2:38:01] <jakkyy> his clearing is so off
[2:38:01] <SICK0> OMEGALUL
[2:38:03] <cloutburstgg> @gonzocc i think its both
[2:38:21] <vent_diver> like when people have bad crosshair placement you can tell but this like makes no sense for peeking anything LUL
[2:38:24] <amutantcookie> but then died to bomb for no reason WTFF
[2:38:27] <soyungregorio> dude, that smoke to under, wtf XD
[2:38:27] <adzno> STatisfacti0n Hella true, if this keeps happening then def, but this one wasnt anything insane to me
[2:38:27] <d4ngr_tv> Looks like good aim and shit game IQ so he doesn't know where to look/pre-aim
[2:38:29] <redsox4evur> stat's here???? fl0mH
[2:38:30] <gonzocc> i dont see cheats yet, but a good player knows how to hide them feelscsman
[2:38:35] <Miljus> he was talking on voice chat in that round check it :(
[2:38:40] <schultzymo> i really don't think hes cheating. If he is hes doing a damn good job at hiding it.
[2:38:41] <STatisfacti0n> @adzno so like someone trying to hide walls will be aware of where someone is (obviously) but will try and make it look like luck, like that round there. not saying that round proves it but more than anything, their timing just seems to be impeccable
[2:38:42] <fl1pdof> Yes
[2:38:43] <furaiiman> my internet is sucks or what

[3:16:06] <daltonlul> I'd rather go to five guys any day of the week
[3:16:06] <JP1910> five guys always seems akward for me in these fastfood tierlists
[3:16:06] <Killer_Panda2k11> In and Out is the next McDonalds. Quick, affordable and losing quality as time passes
[3:16:07] <LowRatedHighlander> Get ready it’ll be quick
[3:16:09] <chickenuggetz2> @WookiePotamus cmonBruh

[3:16:14] <Coldplayer> true burger king is actually better LUL
[3:16:16] <c0rkmcnortis> @denied13 because it is currently soup in my room and my ac is pumping

[3:16:18] <zackthor234> double bacon king gachiW
[3:16:20] <solna15> agreed

[3:16:30] <caffeinetx> whataburger breakfsat is incredible, bu their burgers dont compare to in n outs. smash burger vs reg fast food burger
[3:16:30] <amutantcookie> five guys overrated af
[3:16:34] <Twinandwin> shack sauce is elite
[3:16:34] <sylveonkid1> shake shack is the goat
[3:16:36] <Nemutai_jpeg> Americans are spoiled.
[3:16:37] <carrotstik> shake shack is the most overrated thing ever

[3:17:08] <BoBthebuilder81> i miss roy rodgers hahaha
[3:17:09] <praeter15> fl0m used to like 5 Guys but hes learned and now likes a good ole in n out
[3:17:12] <Killer_Panda2k11> @Benjiweb Impossible whopper is better than the actual whopper. The meat has gone down in quality
[3:17:21] <lavabowser> Best place for a chicken sandwich? @fl0m
[3:17:26] <Gittawat_> @benjiweb  the one with plant base meat? i like plant base meat
[3:17:30] <LowRatedHighlander> Apparently if you order the fries differently at in n out it’s better. Until this is proven I hate in n out
[3:17:34] <iconicchronicle> THANK YOU. People have no idea what fast casual is lmao
[3:17:35] <c0rkmcnortis> denied13 we have one, you probably just don't notice the humidity as much when it's cool

I demand action against tucker and his players for what they have done. My day has been absolutely ruined by this disgusting act of cheating and i dont think i can watch the rest of the match anymore.

I demand action against tucker and his players for what they have done. My day has been absolutely ruined by this disgusting act of cheating and i dont think i can watch the rest of the match anymore. The integrity of these holy matches has been hurt too much for me to just keep on watching this.

[7:16:14] <budgetwaifu> Team Fl0m just hasnt looked the same since last Silver Cast. I mean, why would they ever trade their star entry frags @budgetwaifu and paapoweird, the #1 Silver IGL WookiePotamus, the people's favorite awper Huddlesworth and the excellent support player AFugy. After all the hard times and 2-0 winstreak i just cant believe Erik "fl0m" Flom (CEO of Team Fl0m) would ever trade his elite roster even after winning the first ever Silver Major
