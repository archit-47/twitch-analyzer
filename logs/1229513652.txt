[0:11:09] <random_factz> Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Hitboy’s Hairline. My thesis is that Hitboy’s Hairline is receding by almost an inch every day. As an instinctive response, this makes Hitboy mad which supports my conclusion that Hitboy is in fact malding. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.  fl0mSmorting

[2:44:16] <sorjam> Every year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as "Greggnog." When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, "I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face." I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it.

[3:19:34] <KodaRG> @Flooaboo yeah thats normal for them. Since they don't have to worry about too much they can stream shorter, but I've noticed in a more modern day of streaming, streaming longer hours usually doesn't help alot, usually more consistent streams on smaller amounts is better, its kinda like learning something new

[5:06:17] <snafu415> ^^^
[5:06:30] <NateOnAPlate> @xKorruptGG You're supposed to trim off the outside, that's why it isn't as funky, but the outside should smell pretty funky pre-trimming.
[5:06:34] <72chance> @fl0m whats your go-to at kbbq

[5:07:02] <supra_nightmare> @fl0m if you had to open up a brick and mortar business, all costs aside, what would it be? I've always wanted to own a bar
[5:07:12] <NateOnAPlate> Short rib for sureeee

[5:08:12] <NateOnAPlate> No splitting, that's all for me
[5:08:14] <batsbanaan_> @beerocl0ck 0

[5:09:02] <NateOnAPlate> you also can't compare all you can eat joints to stuff like this.
[5:09:02] <G3RONlMO> it's also NYC
[5:09:05] <c0d3rr> NYC it's generally 75ish anyway
[5:09:08] <two_drop> $58 is higher end but not insane luxury
[5:09:08] <NateOnAPlate> It's just a different experience
[5:09:09] <waferthinmint> $58 isnt that bad. Kansas city is a cowtown and the best steaks we have are going to be minimum 60-70$ per person and thats not even  true wagu.
[5:09:18] <sloveCS> i still need to try a5
[5:09:20] <Scrafted> ngl i wanna try wagyu tartare
[5:09:20] <JoeKer702> That marbling
