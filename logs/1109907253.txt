[0:42:01] <bluehipp0> I think the trick with the ssg553 is to focus on the first 5-8 shots only, I think
[0:42:03] <virtualhoaxx> when you start getting kills in CSGO due to timings and people looking the other way consistently, thats when you are GOOD at CS.

[1:20:36] <AZBound> Most people absolutely carry debt, because they can do so at a rate where they make more in interest elsewhere. The idea of rich = shit paid off is outdated.

[1:21:12] <FunkyFlump> @Kapahi Yeah in finances there's a big difference to unplanned debt and planned debt when you go for a mortgage and credit checks. I imagine wealthy people have a lot of planned debt they know they comfortably take on.
[1:21:12] <apexxsky> Boy
[1:21:12] <Kapahi> capitalism doesn't allow middle class folks to really live a truthful life without debt, unless you are really good at what you do!

[3:49:07] <thej6s> Google is known for creating lots of things and killing them again. I'd say for every good thing they probably make about 10 shitty things
