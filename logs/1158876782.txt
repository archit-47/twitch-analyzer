[0:25:09] <nuke_cs> LucidR9 to provide you with some optimism, the result of getting sick after getting the vaccine is not nearly as bad as if you werent vaccinated. The best analogy is the difference between getting shot with a bulletproof vest and getting shot without one

[0:36:15] <Raymancaster> @nuke_cs same with me, but I think I got into a bit higher level so its probably because im facing better opponents

[0:37:12] <RyanGDS> so you get dualies right?
[0:37:16] <sjoerdtheman> p250 on pistol feels like your giving your advantage of more bullets and firerate away
[0:37:18] <EmilS___> p250 feels like impossible to play in pistol round but godly in eco
[0:37:18] <shmoobs_> dualies all the way
[0:37:19] <vuowng> true

[0:37:40] <Lekr0DeRuS> unless your s1mple
[0:37:47] <PEAC3> the movement error on the glock is so deadly when you‚Äôre up close & personal
[0:37:47] <DimitriPascaluta> I'm clipping this to show every smoothbrain in pugs who tries to tell me that the USP is better than the glock in any situation other than holding some crazy long angle
[0:38:06] <happywidepepo> what abt the dulies on pistols?
[0:38:26] <friendlymackerel> usp can 1 tap
[0:38:34] <KevinXIX> i mean that is the point of the ups right ? bcs of how low the dmg on long distance angles
[0:38:41] <LucidR9> that's what my ex wife calls me
[0:38:43] <NightBear73> @fl0m what‚Äôs up with BNB and Jonji?
[0:38:45] <sjoerdtheman> the usp feels so good if you land the first shot in the head tho
[0:38:45] <ashen21> every time I've seen dualies bought at the pro level they failed miserably
[0:38:46] <D1srvpts> YEP glock
[0:38:50] <cyb4rbird> USP 1 taps so satisfying tho
[0:38:51] <ChosenDew> fl0m what if I told you I was better with the glockenspiel before the changes
[0:38:52] <MorningScout> what's wrong with wet noodles fl0mW
[0:38:53] <nuke_cs> DimitriPascaluta just tell them to ditch the caveman USP meta and adopt the true new order of the dualie meta

[0:48:19] <ImTarco> Valorant's very 1.6-y in terms of tagging and landing movement penalty.
[0:48:19] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> NODDERS
[0:48:20] <PEAC3> @eclipse42 what guns do you use? R301 & flatline, you dont even need an extended clip to knock a person down w those guns
[0:48:20] <agarlicbear> dismantled
[0:48:22] <dasfuzion> fl0m hey got a question, who do think would be the best team as in every pro player but u pick the players

[0:48:41] <LucidR9> its why they're no .1
[0:48:43] <eclipse42> @PEAC3 not sure i have only played a couple times but it was only arenas i think so just whatever that SMG is lol
[0:48:46] <cardnalz> really like to see a complexity win. this lineup looks really exciting I wanna see where this team goes
[0:48:46] <Dweezil_Babua> can confirm. cant suck cock.

[0:48:49] <s1ftonfire> i agRee
[0:48:54] <ekstral0ve> navi is winning the major
[0:48:55] <abhi007bond> BOOBA
[0:48:58] <MrFortyOz> i feel like its easier said then done, it is hard to track and spray
[0:49:00] <ImTarco> Summit admits that he sucks ass at tracking but excels at point-and-shoot aiming.
[0:49:00] <MorningScout> @peac3 can I main shotties like I do in CS? fl0mPOGGERS
[0:49:04] <Archit47> spray and pray daphPray
[0:49:09] <Wich_tv> i like to play quake for tracking practice
[0:49:13] <OrganicPoop> Then what factor to be good at csgo
[0:49:18] <Miksu2222> cs has such dps on weapons that flicking is more important
[0:49:23] <klaxon419> @fl0m yesterday on Ancient Cold almost whiffed because he couldnt track the players while spraying
[0:49:24] <FlameyKumori> WIDE SWING EVERYTHING
[0:49:27] <silver_smurfer_47> this navi is better than prime astralis
[0:49:29] <akstar1009> aka p90 run and gun
[0:49:30] <ImTarco> On the other hand, Apex is 90% tracking.
[0:49:31] <vatal00> @Archit47 Thats what she said KEKW
[0:49:36] <Hunter1087> @fl0m is navi not paying perfecto enough to get those teeth fixed
[0:49:36] <Brodosaur> prius‚Äô observing is the real star of this game imo, when he‚Äôs taking away the xray or keeping it on, just stellar work
[0:49:39] <donbroncolit> !sens

[0:49:42] <Techno> - g1aduz just re-subscribed for 3 months! fl0mPog
[0:49:52] <eclipse42> @fl0m have you played the new ancient? A site is so much better now.
[0:49:54] <sdariopio> that's why on valorant jett is op in lower ranks

[0:49:59] <ImTarco> Microflicks bruv
[0:50:02] <PEAC3> @eclipse42 check out the assault rifles, SMGS are really good but also you need to be up close & person w the enemy, so it‚Äôs a gamble w your skill & game sense
[0:50:04] <benclaudeee> poizon crying
[0:50:04] <Sem073> CoL looks so dead inside.
[0:50:04] <Widepw> @Konstantinovi go where?
[0:50:13] <LucidR9> make sure people cant track you with NordVPN
[0:50:21] <benclaudeee> nazi says zzzz in the chat
[0:50:22] <wrokanik> just use aimlab trace training 4Head
[0:50:22] <Dweezil_Babua> you should make a video out of it

[0:50:40] <eclipse42> @PEAC3 yeah ive played CS for like 15 years so im half decent at any FPS but i get absolutely crushed in apex lul
[0:50:41] <SenpaiKayKayy> it would be interesting to see csgo without the slowing down when tagged

[0:51:06] <MorningScout> @eclipse42 it's the TTK, I feel your pain
[0:51:06] <Nightbot> the year is 31,982 AD. humanity has collapsed and the earth is a wasteland suffering from a perpetual nuclear winter. the last human beings have huddled underground fighting to survive. one human-frog hybrid turns and says "man i have to write a 200 word essay, but i can't stop watching these irradiated potatoes grow". another human-hybrid chimes in, "bro, 200 words isn't even that much"
[0:51:07] <mrziraxer> hey guys who is cheating today
[0:51:08] <friendlymackerel> @SenpaiKayKayy everyone would just go wide as fuck
[0:51:10] <OrganicPoop> Flom is counter strike all about crosshair placement?
[0:51:13] <umaroreis> did you like the new maps? @fl0m
[0:51:20] <ImTarco> Isn't that why Bhopping was so strong in Source?
[0:51:28] <SternXP> P90 days lol

[0:51:38] <OrganicPoop> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:51:45] <miyaa_0> Why is perfectos symbol a drill? @fl0m
[0:51:53] <PEAC3> @eclipse42 switching to apex was a struggle at first bc i played cs for 3 years straight before hand, but it‚Äôs honestly v fun once you pick up how it is
[0:51:53] <eclipse42> @ImTarco you think source had good bhopping if you ever played 1.5 or 1.6 bhopping was nuts. you would go so fast. i miss crouch hopping honestly
[0:52:03] <vchair23> fl0m is it true that good crosshair placement is just a crutch
[0:52:03] <LucidR9> I think we had this convo before
[0:52:06] <mordarbjorn> Perfect tool_
[0:52:10] <chickenuggetz2> u dont need good crosshair placement if you flick onto everyone like s1imple
[0:52:13] <SternXP> cause his PP is perfecto
[0:52:16] <happywidepepo> scream has good tracking :)
[0:52:22] <eclipse42> @PEAC3 im down to play if you want to hold my hand LUL

[0:53:27] <eclipse42> his aim is so nice to watch
[0:53:31] <stongue> Elige is pretty cracked
[0:53:33] <ekstral0ve> stew has some insane tracking too
[0:53:36] <peepofat852> Elige tracking is pretty good
[0:53:37] <MikeQi123> REZ tracking is so good too

[0:53:41] <PEAC3> @eclipse42 i‚Äôd say yes, but im only comfortable adding people i know, im sorry BibleThump
[0:53:45] <Oneesansonly> can you increase stream quality ?
[0:53:47] <Zorik13> electronic is similar in that respect
[0:53:47] <hobrev> elige has some quake pro level tracking, especially considering he plays with a higher sensitivity
[0:53:48] <Paroto7> Ropz is also so good at tracking
[0:53:49] <MrFortyOz> maintain spray, track and crab walk at the same time
[0:53:49] <Deagent9> elige should consider going pro then
[0:53:52] <chickenuggetz2> eliige highlight vid after this map?
[0:53:52] <Brodosaur> elige is just the aimdaddy
[0:53:53] <mamluku> what about magisk electronic @fl0m ?
[0:53:53] <le_petit_phrog> Elige and Naf are amazing

[0:59:11] <Techno> - carharv just re-subscribed for 7 months! fl0mPog
[0:59:16] <chickenuggetz2> is this team better than the team in 2001?

[0:59:22] <eclipse42> POG @bigfani
[0:59:25] <heckfam1> bro but that 2014 VP era bro!!!!! they would beat anyone Kappa
[0:59:25] <milan_inter> let's just enjoy the best player of all time and stop comparing. fl0mG
[0:59:31] <vchair23> that'd be such a wild drop for him, it's not realistic imo
[0:59:38] <PEAC3> i have an issue w people who have wanted to play competitively w me bc they‚Äôre too much of a individual player than a team player if that makes sense
[0:59:38] <MikeQi123> Prime liquid over this navi
[0:59:45] <LucidR9> and he's too cute
[0:59:46] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> Rush to EG PauseFish fl0m
[0:59:47] <Brodosaur> floppy back to nacs I‚Äôm pretty sure, just not sure when he‚Äôs gonna get a roster
[0:59:51] <MrFortyOz> RUSH going back to Optic when they make a new team
[0:59:52] <ImTarco> No reason to undersell himself.
[0:59:56] <dashaCS> Astralis Rush?
[0:59:57] <torp3d0_> may I ask how domiant was prime astralis? or what made them so dominant?
[1:00:01] <jamejacobs> good morning chat

[1:00:27] <Deagent9> jonji, tarik, rush,kennys
[1:00:30] <eclipse42> i think prime fnatic was better than astralis tbf

[1:06:04] <fireblazz_phoenix> Do you think Liquid will finally breakthrough Blast Fall Showdown? Or they would go down to Dignitas like before....Really rooting for liquid when they have better chemistry now...
[1:06:05] <tarekq0n> I think navi's map pool is the best since 2018 astralis era tho what do you think about that @fl0m you just can't beat them in a best of 5
[1:06:05] <realherbacide> 13 GAMES IN a row in the blast pro or whatver

[1:07:26] <RemleJ2> B1t isn't in his peek tho, you are wrong about that part. He is new to the Pro scene . He has to develop more still. Already a beast tho
[1:07:27] <zacp99> who would you say greatest cs play of all time?
[1:07:29] <njgyaani> is nip and navi qualifed  to playoff major @fl0m
[1:07:29] <twitchalittle> where is Get_right?
[1:07:33] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah navi at the beginning of covid looked real rough
[1:07:33] <Uwotm08> @ShiBAILEY No, just the Grand Slam, but he's the clear favourite for Stockholm in November.
[1:07:35] <iamdirtt> yea gambit for example LUL
[1:07:35] <torp3d0_> they have been great for 2 years, but they have been AMAZING since b1t
[1:07:35] <akstar1009> flamie era sucked
[1:07:38] <vchair23> think they've definitely shown the highest ceiling I think, but not super consistent or anything
[1:07:39] <mArcusX87> no @fl0m they have look at their tournament wins they won the last lan tournament before covid and also won the grand slam and I think the only games they have lost is vs gambit... so no @fl0m I'm sorry you is wrong xD
[1:07:41] <sylveonkid1> navi did this all online let me see them do it on lan
[1:07:42] <LowRatedHighlander> and like the online era

[1:18:35] <lilshauty> Thanks @morningscout
[1:18:36] <magni_bot> I like that they added a different map, maybe its just me but chache, dust and mirage are to similar to all be in.
[1:18:37] <mmikuw> do you guys think cache or cobble should be brought back?
[1:18:38] <TestTubeBaba> LUL
[1:18:39] <idiosyncraticthought> Couldn‚Äôt they have the creator sign an agreement to give over modification control/rights to valve? @fl0m
[1:18:43] <hobrev> I wonder what is preventing valve from adding the updated cache from workshop into the map pool
[1:18:49] <Nightbot> Latest video: What MYTHIC's CS:GO Voice Comms Sound Like During Comeback Games! - https://youtu.be/IUN0RYgVCro
[1:18:51] <siiiif> MorningScout will you give pp touch? Peepo
[1:18:51] <MorningScout> imagine playing CS as a new player and never knowing about cobble
[1:18:57] <cardboardtoast> @fl0m what are the chances mythic will try to do practice matches against teams like BNB after dreamhack?
[1:18:59] <i_AWP> What‚Äôd they actually do to cache besides add window & make it green?
[1:19:00] <Ravager72> Do you think a 9 map pool would ever work/be good for the scene? Or is 7 the ideal size? Always wondered @fl0m
[1:19:02] <le_petit_phrog> @idiosyncraticthought I feel like in that case it would just be too extra
[1:19:02] <Booooooolin> siiiif OOOO

[1:43:23] <catluvr_199x> they literally got 3rd at Berlin. How is that some unacceptable level of performance?

[2:17:27] <Miksu2222> do you see any org picking up an NA roster anytime soon?
[2:17:39] <itPat> ive hit the point where I just root for individual players and dont really care about the teams

[2:19:23] <ShallowSloth> why dont players just simply be the best player in the world?
[2:19:35] <le_petit_phrog> Since NA usually gets 2-3 major spots, Liquid/??/Furia
[2:19:38] <raisinbranistasty> fl0m recruit RUSH for Mythic Kappa
[2:19:44] <umaroreis> 100t especially had a major spot
[2:19:52] <mArcusX87> has steels ban been lifted by valve because of the new ban rules of 5 year max @fl0m or anyone?
[2:19:57] <stuartlittle553> stuartlittle553 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:19:57] <Techno> - stuartlittle553 just re-subscribed for 12 months! fl0mPog
[2:19:59] <speciality_> @marcusx87 no
[2:19:59] <Thugs_Bunny268> @speciality_ maybe bnb to cs or xappa back
[2:20:04] <umaroreis> NA gets 5 major spots now
[2:20:12] <mArcusX87> ok thank you @speciality_
[2:20:13] <mysterionprime> 100t was just unlucky
[2:20:15] <le_petit_phrog> 5??
[2:20:21] <dankiyy> 100t had stickers in the game twice and didnt play either one LUL
[2:20:27] <YourCue> KQLY less of a problem than Steel?????
[2:20:32] <v1sages> I have a glock candy apple with all the 100t sickers I uboxed on it. Pretty Pog
[2:20:37] <steelarm77> afaik steel got banned for match fixing, not hax?
[2:20:38] <zzeenon> dont fuck with valves skins bro
[2:20:38] <itPat> isnt that if you cheated before competing
[2:20:43] <KNAPKINAT0R> rage till we get mythic stickers
[2:20:44] <mArcusX87> oh i see its for VAC not for sports conduct i guess
[2:20:45] <EmilS___> KQLY can go back but not steel?
[2:20:56] <audio_noodle> @fl0m I'm interested, why does every pro player use gaming headphones, despite them limiting awareness a lot, even outside of contracts
[2:20:59] <Huddlesworth> holy shit map 3 oh shit nuke welp gg CoL
[2:21:01] <therealkopojken> also if you cheat in an actual competition you cant come back ever i think
[2:21:04] <speciality_> @thugs_bunny268 xeppaa would be cool as well but he‚Äôs on Val now with chaos team
[2:21:09] <therealkopojken> so kqly stays banned
[2:21:17] <Uwotm08> Really? I thought with a VAC ban during your career you're forever banned from Valve events.
[2:21:18] <ShallowSloth> i dont get why steel got banned for match fixing, i mean if he didnt fix it then it would have just stayed broken
[2:21:19] <SenpaiKayKayy> so if you cheat youre less of a scum then some kids that wanted some skins and made a dumb mistake
[2:21:23] <dankiyy> bc sponsors and preference
[2:21:29] <sulls777> Why would 100t drop that last roster they were actually doing really well
[2:21:30] <astrononymous> 'cookley'
[2:21:35] <YourCue> oh well that's good
[2:21:35] <Herabitix> @uwotm08 they changed that rule over the summer i think
[2:21:41] <mArcusX87> i think steel could end up on a team in CSGO as a technical behind the scenes kind of person although knowing josh he just loves to compete so much
[2:21:45] <audio_noodle> something that can tell enemy position more than 90 degrees accurate lol
[2:21:48] <Artsywyo> Weird looking at hltv map stats and seeing NATUS VINCERE AS THE BEST NUKE TEAM ya know. that Non tactical russian cyka team
[2:21:50] <Huddlesworth> also MLADY everyone
[2:21:50] <therealkopojken> @Uwotm08 it's for before competition
[2:21:56] <Uwotm08> @Herabitix Yeah, for jamppi, who got VAC banned as a child, before his pro career. But if you're a pro and you threw, or cheated, you stay banned.
[2:21:59] <Cake315> fl0m is your headset as thicc as you are?

[2:22:08] <dankiyy> they did good, then after starladder it went south
[2:22:11] <froster5226> where can i buy a life size cardboard cutout of Chris? Asking for a friend
[2:22:12] <HerrRhodes> @fl0m extremum currently leads NA in RMR points if i remember right
[2:22:15] <Uwotm08> And we're only talking Majors here. There are still other tournaments.
[2:22:17] <silviu_cs> @SenpaiKayKayy the players who can come back have all cheated outside of a competitive medium. iBP threw an official match. That's the difference
[2:22:18] <umaroreis> I mean it was a time when there were a lot of NA events and just before they'd go to EU for EPL and shit
[2:22:22] <WRXorcist> @sulls777 cos nadeshot had an opportunity to join CDL & sold out the CSGO team
[2:22:22] <n1c0otv> wait what happening?\

[2:22:28] <le_petit_phrog> @uwotm08 wasn‚Äôt it an account that jamppi bought?

[2:23:23] <froster5226> even a $15 pair of headphones is better than speakers

[2:23:57] <KNAPKINAT0R> thoughts on gr1m?
[2:24:02] <IRunOnSlash> You can actually buy earbuds that do better than expensive headphones, because they hit lows and many expensive ass audiophile headphones arent keen on them
[2:24:03] <le_petit_phrog> @raisinbranistasty I had turtle beach red that could work for xbox pc ps and it was amazing

[2:25:57] <IRunOnSlash> There are multiple IEMs less than forty bucks that actively destroy audiophile headphones gaming wise
[2:26:03] <suffer95> are  cheap knife skins worth buying? i wanna buy a skin but so damn expensive!
[2:26:04] <vatal00> @fl0m do you have specific audio settings you recommend for CSGO, i cant hear anything when my friends can
[2:26:05] <audio_noodle> the 5Head sentence
[2:26:08] <dankiyy> twitstzz wanted out
[2:26:15] <SenpaiKayKayy> liquid needed a player like fallen
[2:26:18] <bigfani> suffer95 depends on if you like the skin
[2:26:19] <Uwotm08> Just have two VU meters on your desktop to represent your speakers and do those Fourier calculations in your head to determine what sounds are being played.
[2:26:25] <ShallowSloth> have they tried just not losing
[2:26:25] <KNAPKINAT0R> yea but if they kept twistzz over gr1m....

[2:27:08] <le_petit_phrog> Grim was severely underrated when he came in, he just has to perform against the top tiers and with the team form I believe it‚Äôll work
[2:27:09] <peepofat852> Fallen joining adds so much value imo it's underestimated
[2:27:11] <audio_noodle> @fl0m oh ye, fun fact. csgo almost completely mutes footsteps etc behind compression when you start shooting a gun

[2:36:42] <Destructoid5858> It would be the worst if Niko, niko, and hiko were all on a team together. That casters would be in such an impossible situation
[2:36:43] <dFab1> I think there was a Nico too

[2:45:03] <steelarm77> i find it so funny that in val teams try to retake sometimes even in a 2v4 but in cs a 2v3 is a no-no

[2:45:32] <alm0st_xd> A part of me really wants astralis to keep Xyp in the team in place of Bubjzki, just for the nostlgia factor, i think.
[2:45:34] <frogoree> they do a good job fl0mSmort
[2:45:44] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> is that why Astralis was able to dismantle them so well in the past @fl0m

[2:45:51] <KNAPKINAT0R> well b1t is out of his mind too, kids so good
[2:45:52] <hobrev> basically defaulting, which is supposed to be really hard on nuke
[2:45:53] <le_petit_phrog> Flamie was OG, but ever since they got rid of him for B1T they‚Äôve really been unstoppable

[4:42:16] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m does blast force them to use the default models?
[4:42:27] <ozzers23> The chicken is dry because they have to cook the E. coli out of it

[4:43:05] <froster5226> some really weird rounds this map
[4:43:09] <filipcash> can you play with agent skins? no right?
[4:43:13] <Rycees_> so close
[4:43:15] <priiide_> i feel like default models is just the safe way to go
[4:43:16] <siiiif> Blast should force Condom Head v. Scuba Steve for all matches HELLAWICKED
[4:43:18] <G0urami> NT
[4:43:20] <zefixlikescsgo> @sem073 scuba bardolph
[4:43:20] <digitallyanalog> True, scuba steve is a silent assasin
[4:43:25] <WookiePotamus> the new Green operator on ancient is like a Chameleon
[4:43:26] <sloveCS> so weird that is not allowed for all these big events but the biggest event, the major, they can use them
[4:43:30] <Sem073> Chris laughs like he's plotting something evil
[4:43:32] <priiide_> as funny as some of the models are, consistency is prolly ideal
[4:43:37] <need_a_name__> hero ak round
[4:43:38] <cloud_zenn> some old man reflxes Sadge
[4:43:58] <td_gg> imo there should be a console command to disable agent skins for all gamemodes
[4:44:02] <siiiif> YEP yentlemen
[4:44:03] <bluehipp0> jentelmen agreement
[4:44:04] <digitallyanalog> i hope the major enforces only the new models
[4:44:05] <Hemotional> Lets go OOOOG
[4:44:08] <froster5226> or just turn models off client side
[4:44:10] <Cyan_die> peepoW some of those ct models on ancient
[4:44:14] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m is there an open for the major or is it just RMR stuff
[4:44:21] <Deptical54> what role does twistzz play on Faze?
[4:44:27] <Flewyy> lol who doesn't want to see scuba suits running  around
[4:44:30] <Hemotional> OOOO G
[4:44:32] <sloveCS> rmr stuff wookie
[4:44:36] <sloveCS> they had the open for rmr
[4:44:36] <MuerteMan> fl0mH gtrSweden
[4:44:41] <validusghosty> Can anyone co stream csgo or do you need permission ????
[4:44:44] <supra_nightmare> i think professionally, the game looks cleaner without the models
[4:44:45] <need_a_name__> the stack paid off
[4:44:46] <bobson300101> @fl0m why were OGs site takes so  bad for the most part on their t side
[4:44:49] <Shinohime> Valve should make the model thing a client sided option
[4:44:50] <rony9> I'm really loving the new operation
[4:44:50] <WookiePotamus> ah ok
[4:44:54] <zefixlikescsgo> @validusghosty permission iirc
[4:44:58] <Gearslayer360> they just got fuckin destroyed
[4:45:01] <IShaharI> @validusghosty need to have permission from the owners of the stream
[4:45:08] <Sem073> Extremum is actually leading the NA RMR and we havent seen them play in like 5 months
[4:45:10] <dFab1> You need to ask your parents before streaming

[5:48:03] <nickbarrel867> or ct gets 1 deag and bam no retake nades
[5:48:04] <tedfa> Nade dropping is probably mostly going to be used for economy purposes. Not weird tricks
[5:48:04] <froster5226> do people not get you still can't buy more than usual amount of nades? dropping them for one site will leave other site dry

[5:48:15] <LowRatedHighlander> but fl0m i saw jojo fake flash some random lvl 10 on faceit by dropping a flash so obviously this means all the pros are gonna fall for it/ do it peepoIQ
[5:48:22] <bobson300101> KARRIGAN
[5:48:26] <makker_tv> There's gonna be counter plays as well, seems like everyone thinks its a one sided change

[5:48:34] <aetherealphoenix> I appreciate the droppable nades it makes my use of smokes that pretty much no one else does that much easier for taking sites etc
[5:48:35] <JamesHolmes97> I think the mid round dropping is awkward and definitely has counter play, but it doesnt help the economy side. If you buy a smoke I think you should drop one to a teammate too

[6:08:15] <dweevers> so4pybox yeah but that was a little different because you had someone of ethan's talent available.
[6:08:17] <Nyct0z> was steel the main caller for 100t?

[6:08:21] <hobrev> yes
[6:08:22] <Inversion101> they have nitr0 so its not too bad I imagine nitr0 has been doing part of the igling anyways
[6:08:22] <itstruthz> maybe the end statement from Steel in the 100T vieo was foreshadowing there were problems

[6:34:20] <SpoinkJr> fantasy + redzone makes the NFL amazing, without it, it's kind of meh, like you said, unless you LOVE a team
[6:34:23] <Mattchew_TV> Bro why do you have to defend the fact that you don't enjoy NFL...I don't get why people think you have to like the same things they like

[6:37:38] <mouz53> offside with blind refs is even more interesting.
[6:37:39] <elon_y> @fl0m  are hockey offsides the same as soccer ones
[6:37:40] <ItzSwizzG> i would bet 100 subs you couldnt score on me
[6:37:44] <BozzyRL> TNT
[6:37:48] <shagy_91> I love hockey, but nobody here broadcasts it
[6:37:49] <AMutantCookie> @elon_y somewhat but the line stays as a solid
[6:37:50] <yogi_sb> fox sports?
[6:37:54] <sol1taire> Tampa Bay lightning single-handedly brought hockey to the mainstreM IN fl
[6:37:55] <akkueT> @fl0m can you name best finnish player? :)
[6:37:55] <Its_mosis> soccer is prolly the most accessible sport. Makes sense why its the most popular sport in the world
[6:38:09] <ajdummy> TNT
[6:38:11] <yogi_sb> i remember watching vs for hockey growing up
[6:38:11] <SethDave> hockey coaches are the best
[6:38:13] <rivv3> 4 billion follow 'soccer'
[6:38:18] <yogi_sb> i think that became fox sports 1
[6:38:18] <Sem073> Who is the best EU player in the NHL
[6:38:23] <rwreyford> i only played peewee hockey and I was in college marching band for football but I'll be damned if the stanley cup isn't the hypest sporting event known to man
[6:38:26] <mouz53> Ovi
[6:38:28] <RedRock20> Dont get me wrong I love playing soccer, but watching can be boring for others watching with me
[6:38:29] <theD0RF> @elon_y No
[6:38:30] <yogi_sb> ovechkin for sure
[6:38:32] <stephkloos69> 'soccer' is fun to watch
[6:38:33] <suuuuu_s> i've played soccer with garbage
[6:38:34] <akkueT> hockey is best
[6:38:37] <AMutantCookie> fl0m have you watched the leafs prime show? KEKW
[6:38:41] <hobrev> to some extent it is
[6:38:45] <Rob_Kebab> hockey is fun to watch even for me who doesnt know much abt it
[6:38:47] <RedRock20> Hockey shit talking is the best too @fl0m
[6:38:59] <G3RONlMO> soccer field is far less maintenance than a rink
[6:39:00] <ozzers23> Hahahhahahahha
[6:39:00] <rwreyford> but I'm also a lifelong Colorado Avalanche fan COPIUM
[6:39:03] <sol1taire> some of the highlights from hockey from the 80s are magic
[6:39:06] <memesrheaven> do you play hockey occasionally??
[6:39:11] <stephkloos69> i can watch football but not baseball

[6:39:11] <AMutantCookie> hockey is basicly 5aside soccer on ice
[6:39:14] <ItzSwizzG> how hockey was made: 2 meth'd out Canadians sliding on ice
[6:39:14] <Bolly> also fewer players crying while faking injuries
[6:39:15] <abhi007bond> fl0mSwole
[6:39:21] <Inversion101> hockey is soccer on ice with violence Pog

[6:39:23] <mouz53> @rwreyford Could be worse lol
[6:39:26] <sol1taire> @stephkloos69 ive been trying to get flom to do some yoga for a year now lol
[6:39:27] <Thatonekidmike> @fl0m Honestly it's very similar to soccer just on ice
[6:39:34] <clastonz> its kinda weird that they are allowed to just start a 1v1 fist fight during ahockey match...
[6:39:39] <RedRock20> @Bolly instead they dont tell you that they have several broken bones and play on
[6:39:40] <messyhair> embellishments in hockey are a lot more hilarious than in other sports NODDERS
[6:39:45] <stephkloos69> @sol1taire u can convince him a 5gift
[6:39:46] <suuuuu_s> you ever play apex fl0m?
[6:39:59] <stephkloos69> gifted*
[6:40:00] <iizarian> yeah that used to be huge back in the day
[6:40:02] <Its_mosis> is it illegal for me, a canadian to have probably watched 3 hockey games in my life
[6:40:02] <sol1taire> @stephkloos69 i can only afford a 1 gift
[6:40:03] <Inversion101> wtf are og doing rn kekw
[6:40:05] <rwreyford> @rwreyford well i was an ALT thrashers fan back in the day so I've been there lol
[6:40:07] <Inversion101> throwing
[6:40:14] <brawrrrr> enforcers not need anymore in nhl
[6:40:21] <orphansquirel> ive met 2 players in soccer who used to be hockey players and they had some of the greatest jukes ive seen idk what about it makes them so nimble
[6:40:21] <ItzSwizzG> did you watch the danbury trashers documentary on netflix?
[6:40:31] <stephkloos69> @sol1taire its gonna be a bit rough to convince him with 1 gifted, but u can convince me w it <3
[6:40:32] <SethDave> and a big stink when it wasn't just white skaters fighting anymore
[6:40:34] <mouz53> enforcers are just people like Marchand now lmao
[6:40:34] <TLsmf> is it me or is soccer not fun to watch these days ?
[6:40:36] <Thatonekidmike> Fights were fun to watch but I'm glad they're pretty rare now
[6:40:40] <memesrheaven> i heard that hockey is a pretty rough sport
[6:40:40] <iizarian> peter worrell on the panthers would get into a fight almost every game
[6:40:43] <stephkloos69> pick a day @sol1taire
[6:40:44] <iizarian> and he was a massive dude
[6:40:45] <sol1taire> @stephkloos69 im a big yoga proponent
[6:40:46] <AMutantCookie> there were too many fights and now theres not enough. I think there can be a middle
[6:40:47] <andrewmedaTV> @inversion101 they gamble stacked because they had a low buy. Very normal
[6:40:50] <royield> yeah
[6:40:51] <akkueT> @TLsmf yep feels like it
[6:40:58] <Quick_Lets_Run> ppl love football cause is easy and cheap to play. Ev1 kicked a football and is easy to watch. Hockey is more complex
[6:41:00] <sol1taire> @stephkloos69 it even improves your game sense and aim in cs go
[6:41:00] <IAmADwarfIrl> when fights do happen these days, you can usually understand why. the skill level in play has gotten so much better in the last 10 years thanks to the absence of goons
[6:41:02] <Mattchew_TV> Hockey has the best over time rules out of all sports
[6:41:04] <stephkloos69> @sol1taire ya must be flexible af then
[6:41:05] <akkueT> @TLsmf that its boring nowdays
[6:41:09] <rwreyford> still pissed that Atlanta thrashers got sold off to winnepeg sadge
[6:41:13] <suuuuu_s> a full set a teeth = not a good hockey player
[6:41:16] <stephkloos69> @sol1taire indeed
[6:41:22] <Nitrech> the lower levels just beat the crap out of each other constantly lol
[6:41:26] <SethDave> I love too how they describe injuries.. upper body injury or lower body injury lol
[6:41:27] <sol1taire> @stephkloos69 ability to focus, stay calm, and stay away from screens for extended period of time

[6:42:44] <rivv3> with football you can play it anywhere, only need a ball. in poor places they even play without a proper ball. makes it really easy to access
[6:42:45] <ItzSwizzG> you gotta fill a role
[6:42:46] <AMutantCookie> wym enforcers were the most skilled players on the teams Pepega
[6:42:48] <ozzers23> In Boise our hockey team is the closest thing to pro sports we have and those games are so lit.

[6:44:11] <Mattchew_TV> Dude it's  MUST watch on Netflix

[6:52:28] <LowRatedHighlander> !1080
[6:52:34] <LowRatedHighlander> !1080p
[6:52:34] <Nightbot> 936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.
[6:52:34] <WookiePotamus> @messyhair panthers football or hockey fl0mHmm
[6:52:36] <sol1taire> omg ive been playing at 60hz since 2000
[6:52:38] <Levianc> Absolutely does
[6:52:42] <W0rstCase0ntarioBud> agreed
[6:52:43] <messyhair> hockey obvs wookie
[6:52:45] <xremmyxcsgo> do you ever lose your cursor when playing bloons?
[6:52:49] <xremmyxcsgo> shit happens to all the time
[6:52:50] <WookiePotamus> oh KEKPOINT
[6:52:52] <st4sisfield> he ain't wrong. 60 to 144 was crazy
[6:52:54] <messyhair> PepeLaugh
[6:52:55] <sol1taire> wait, it's that dramatic going from 60 to 144 ??!?!?!?!?1
[6:52:58] <fastcars888> same like from membrane to mechanical
[6:52:59] <sol1taire> what?????
[6:53:00] <teoceausescu> 60 to 360
[6:53:03] <AMutantCookie> 60 to 144 is life changing
[6:53:03] <virtualhoaxx> well said , when i switched to 144Hz , its a new world
[6:53:04] <erk12> 60hz is disgusting
[6:53:06] <juster_is> 60hz is dogshit tho
[6:53:07] <TheRock_as> @sol1taire yes
[6:53:10] <wipwopmagop> 60 is disgusting dogshit
[6:53:10] <dukyy837> 60hz are good
[6:53:10] <Achapman18> yes 144 is a game changer
[6:53:11] <sol1taire> what the hell, i had no idea
[6:53:14] <cosmic_sasquatch> hoping for the day i leave 60
[6:53:14] <theBaboda> @sol1taire its that dramatic, 60 to 144 was CRAZY
[6:53:23] <snailshoes> i can play 60 fps on red dead 2 but it plays much smoother around 100
[6:53:24] <Goose_iwnl> i went from 60 straight to 240. blew my mind
[6:53:27] <STatisfacti0n> 240 has too much ghosting for me
[6:53:28] <shadow_799> where do I go to get better twitch emotes?
[6:53:30] <theBaboda> nvidia 360hz monitors HELLAWICKED
[6:53:30] <Achapman18> YEP
[6:53:33] <Cyan_die> peepoW 60hz is scary now
[6:53:34] <frykis88> agreed
[6:53:34] <TheRock_as> Same
[6:53:42] <Darra5> Go up to 360
[6:53:42] <virtualhoaxx> i have 166Hz so the sweet spot
[6:53:47] <sol1taire> and from 240 hz to 360 hz?
[6:53:47] <clastonz> i still play csgo 60hz :/
[6:53:53] <SmithyAG> @shadow_799 betterttv chrome extension
[6:53:53] <SquiDI0> same, i can't play on 60Hz on PC anymore, it feels so... uncomfortable
[6:53:54] <PINKGU_Y> @clastonz same here
[6:53:59] <st4sisfield> things just don't feel smooth on 60hz after using 144hz
[6:53:59] <erk12> i thought i broke my pc but my monitor got reset to 60hz
[6:54:01] <AMutantCookie> same it feels like the game is running in sludge
[6:54:06] <sol1taire> thanks i had no idea it was that dramatic. I been playing on 60z since 2001
[6:54:07] <frykis88> 1440p with 165hz is gold :P
[6:54:09] <TheRock_as> Why?
[6:54:16] <Miksu2222> all 360s ghost alot
[6:54:16] <Jazprr> Its prolly the monitor more than the PC with ghosting tho right??
[6:54:17] <CochinoMigs> too new?
[6:54:19] <heyitstiesey> why is 260 bad
[6:54:20] <Widepw> @fl0m what is this gibberish you are talking about, we know since 90s commercials that human eye can only see 24 frames per second.
[6:54:21] <shadow_799> @SmithyAG ty <3
[6:54:23] <juster_is> ghosting depends on the monitor, pretty sure
[6:54:23] <sol1taire> what is ghosting
[6:54:24] <virtualhoaxx> @frykis88 yep i have the same
[6:54:27] <erk12> define ghosting
[6:54:28] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m dude I'm still rocking a 1080ti. that said I'm totally in love with my LG that's a 144 Hz. it isn't a TN panel
[6:54:32] <SmithyAG> @shadow_799 np dude
[6:54:34] <frykis88> @virtualhoaxx my man
[6:54:45] <callmeaderp> elige has 360

[6:55:10] <frykis88> isnt the ghosting because of the response time in the panel?
[6:55:15] <GriefnChief> You need your frames to match too
[6:55:20] <RagingWalrus12> so its sacrificing video quality for preformane?
[6:55:25] <Corresi> dude i've been playing 75hz and changing from 60hz felt good amount of distance
[6:55:25] <virtualhoaxx> maybe he uses a lower refresh rate even if he has 360Hz
[6:55:28] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m yeah, I have their 2k 144 Hz with an IPS panel and it's just chef's kiss

[6:55:54] <erk12> he have a youtube
[6:55:56] <biku___> @fl0m i think "the feel" has something to do with how much ms it takes to refresh more than the HZ, 60hz it takes 16ms, 144hz is 6.9ms, 240hz is 4.1ms, 360 is 2.7ms, etc

[6:56:22] <frykis88> gsync and freesync is a must too
[6:56:23] <1Zhhzh> so i think using 360fps is kinda early now
[6:56:24] <Sem073> Aleksi tryna come in contact with the Cs gods
[6:56:27] <STatisfacti0n> @frykis88 essentially. the Grey to Grey time is what really matters when you start pumping up refresh rate

[6:58:32] <sol1taire> wookie im gonna try to get my discord set up once again lol

[7:52:32] <Mazvydas> what does elite targeting do??
[7:52:42] <a732v> elite targeting is ok. It prioritizes strong, but if the bloons get close to the end, it switches to first
[7:52:51] <a732v> I'm like 80% sure
[7:52:56] <itz_shippy> What tower is your favorite rn?

[7:55:55] <iVex> @itz_shippy doesn't have to be those 3, just 3/4 tower types
[7:55:56] <a732v> From bloons wiki: "when set to elite, Snipers will target Strong Bloons normally and then change targeting to First when bloons are near the exit. "
[7:55:57] <ItsAho> Vengeful sun God is best tower in the game but do you have the knowledge upgrades for it?
[7:56:35] <itz_shippy> @iVex yes but those types result in the most damage, vs support which does supportive elements
