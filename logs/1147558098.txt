[4:07:10] <WookiePotamus> @Justhoohaa knew someone was gunna say that. im disappointed it was u
[4:07:11] <NemaTad> faceit is so laggy for me cause I live in Japan and there is only one server to play on and it's in Singapore :(
[4:07:13] <Twinandwin> @Floofys not anymore but used to
[4:07:16] <Floofys> It is so expensive
[4:07:22] <mk_48> arent magic standard decks like north of 600 dollars?
[4:07:22] <Piesito0> i used to play but yeah really expensive
[4:07:23] <MrTenebret> I play it. Not homeless... yet.
[4:07:23] <TLHBRONCO> Commander is the best Magic format.  Don't @ me.
[4:07:28] <future_jason> magic is crazy expensive and you can't flip boxes for profit like pokemon cards
[4:07:29] <Floofys> Dude we're going back to Innistrad on Thursday though!
[4:07:31] <mk_48> not even talking about all the tech cards, just one deck
[4:07:38] <Justhoohaa> @wookiepotamus wtf does that mean. am I not good enough for you

[4:07:50] <Justhoohaa> Sadge
[4:07:52] <psyc0pathy> @fl0m i used to play mtg. i stopped for some reason and all of a sudden card prices went crazy
[4:07:55] <Floofys> @TLHBRONCO Commander is great. Draft is also great
[4:08:02] <TLHBRONCO> Draft is good fun also
[4:08:16] <NemaTad> magic isn't that expensive if you only play mono red like a true chad
[4:08:22] <Floofys> That's true
[4:08:24] <DrtNinja> is the tec-9 back? @fl0m
[4:08:25] <Floofys> Red is pretty cheap
[4:08:29] <CortanaLXIX> @TLHBRONCO rip golos FEelsBadMan
[4:08:30] <Floofys> Mono-white is also pretty cheap
[4:08:33] <WookiePotamus> @Justhoohaa fl0mHmm no comment
[4:08:37] <Floofys> Golos deserved the ban
[4:08:43] <TLHBRONCO> Years ago I used to draft every weekend at the card shop then play Commander until 2AM.  Simpler times lol.

[5:44:31] <NERVg> afternoon all MLADY
[5:44:36] <tzinga7> how true is the thing that overpass is a 6v6 map on paper, flom?
[5:44:42] <Alwayspinchy> !deagle
[5:44:45] <siiiif> are those arctis wireless PROS? BOOBA
[5:44:55] <BoomingBusiness> true NODDERS
[5:45:02] <BizarreMark> COPIUM we dont talk about that round
[5:45:13] <future_jason> everyone would be talking they're a top 5 team
[5:45:13] <BoomingBusiness> except they did get 1v5d by a GA LUL
[5:45:14] <LowRatedHighlander> YEP
[5:45:16] <shuttupmichael> that 1v5 was so painful.. esp after that comeback they played so well
[5:45:21] <mohammadreza99a> man that was hard to watch
[5:45:24] <LowRatedHighlander> exactly what fl0m said
[5:45:27] <LucidR9> would've gotten smacked by NAVI anyway COPIUM
[5:45:33] <cottam_021> They played far better than anyone expected
[5:45:34] <mohammadreza99a> they taught it was over
[5:45:36] <siiiif> yeah i remember when nothing happened on inferno B site COPIUM
[5:45:39] <froux01> THIS @fl0m
[5:45:40] <BoomingBusiness> NODDERS Lucid
[5:45:42] <alyanko_0> I think liquid can do great again
[5:45:42] <Scornfulboot_eu> the adren factor
[5:45:42] <tzinga7> hw true is the thing that overpass is a 6v6 map on paper
[5:45:47] <mk_48> Adren was the solution Pog
[5:45:48] <future_jason> if they didn't get 1v5d everyone thinks they're a top 5 team along with Vitality
[5:45:53] <LucidR9> you mean ahdroon
[5:46:01] <shuttupmichael> not saying the would have beat navi but they would have given them a run for their money at the very least
[5:46:02] <froux01> @tzinga7 I also want to know
[5:46:05] <hemo_tox> You mean former Mythic hard carry Adren?
[5:46:10] <Smashehhh> hltv only put them to 11th that site sucks haha
[5:46:12] <marcin123411> #11 now
[5:46:15] <Luigistarx> they only moved up 2
[5:46:22] <Luigistarx> if you're talking about today
[5:46:29] <spli7er> ayyo
[5:46:29] <alyanko_0> it's hard to be team liquid's fan
[5:46:31] <cottam_021> need to give credit to refresh for ace clutching with a galil
[5:46:44] <LowRatedHighlander> They’ve beaten Navi before not too long ago so I mean I’d say they at least had a chance
[5:46:51] <tzinga7> overpass feels like a flom's map always :D
[5:46:52] <caguirre18> That liquid heroic series tilted me off the face of the planet. and I am not even a liquid fan
[5:46:52] <LowRatedHighlander> But Navi is fuckin cracked right now
[5:46:56] <LucidR9> how are g2 still third
[5:46:59] <mohammadreza99a> fl0m any taughts on the impact of Fallen as the IGL?

[6:37:49] <LowRatedHighlander> So how you gon say bleed is better because of an item that relies on critting
[6:37:55] <IcyCucumber420> 16 people are gambling in total KEKW
[6:37:58] <Speedrulez> sevengaming_tv speedr25Blank i feel you
[6:38:00] <LowRatedHighlander> Like come on
[6:38:00] <praeter15> because bleed does the damage not the crit
[6:38:07] <sleeeeppyyyy> sevengaming_tv that face... you ready to blow? or you taking it in the butt? paapoWeird
[6:38:11] <LowRatedHighlander> But the damage doesn’t happen without the crit
[6:38:12] <blackteanotcoffee> @IcyCucumber420 I put 200 in I feel poor af
[6:38:18] <praeter15> you still have the daggers tho
[6:38:26] <LowRatedHighlander> Like the damage is nonexisitant without the crit
[6:38:26] <praeter15> and thats 8 stacks per shot
[6:38:28] <sevengaming_tv> whats the fun in spoiling the context sleeeeppyyyy
[6:38:35] <LowRatedHighlander> The daggers act separately from the shatterspleen
[6:38:40] <praeter15> max captain bleed is 8 stacks of blood per shot

[7:31:01] <praeter15> L
[7:31:02] <Benjiweb> KEEP BAND
[7:31:21] <praeter15> the way acrid froze there KEKPOINT
[7:31:21] <LowRatedHighlander> uke is good but you already have 2 and its not that good against mythrix.
[7:31:28] <Benjiweb> you need to do like 600% base damage to proc the fire band
[7:31:30] <siiiif> hit it
[7:31:31] <siiiif> no
[7:31:33] <BenjiFrags_> BenjiFrags_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! fl0mHeart nice cock
[7:31:33] <Techno> - BenjiFrags_ just re-subscribed for 13 months! fl0mPog
[7:31:34] <praeter15> BenForFriends 400
[7:31:34] <LowRatedHighlander> band should be procing off his jump though right?
[7:31:36] <theDeacon> Uke only good against Myth's second phase
[7:31:47] <LowRatedHighlander> oh maybe not
[7:31:52] <Puddin_Wing> @fl0m I'm not sure what we're talking about, but i don't think it'll make much difference unless the band gives you some talent you fuckin HACK
[7:31:53] <Puddin_Wing> roasted
[7:31:55] <praeter15> i think his jump does 300% LowRatedHighlander
[7:31:56] <Puddin_Wing> classic roast
[7:31:59] <Puddin_Wing> that's a classic roast
[7:32:01] <LowRatedHighlander> praeter15 rip
[7:32:02] <RasyPasy> it procs of of high amounts of damage and does crazy damage @fl0m
[7:32:02] <praeter15> nice one feeny
[7:32:15] <LowRatedHighlander> well all he needs is an item to proc it and hell be good
[7:32:23] <theDeacon> Gorags is so good though, buffs the turrets as well
[7:32:23] <LowRatedHighlander> Prayge capacitor
[7:32:30] <praeter15> can we get a Comedy Central Roast of fl0m but its only feeny on stage
[7:32:35] <Solank0> You can but you have to have a fast reaction the longer it goes. Typically skip those in multiplayer as you cant cheese the drops with menu pausing
[7:32:41] <LowRatedHighlander> praeter15 yes pls Peepo
[7:32:45] <Puddin_Wing> i could fill that broadcast time easily
[7:32:50] <praeter15> 90 minutes
[7:33:04] <Puddin_Wing> p sure i could roast fl0m for 90 minutes without even waking up
[7:33:15] <LowRatedHighlander> also i meant to ask why is your job more busy during this time? or is that too personal?
[7:33:20] <praeter15> nori is the only person in the crowd
[7:33:29] <LowRatedHighlander> holiday music?
[7:33:30] <ONra1g> this game its so cool
[7:33:31] <siiiif> your first mistake is thinking fl0m would be able to get onto comedy central KEKWait
[7:33:51] <praeter15> LowRatedHighlander feeny is a part time santa elf and makes toys for christmas
[7:34:04] <Puddin_Wing> a big part of it is holiday music. Plus i think everyone's settling down from whatever and wherever they've been for the summer so now they have time @LowRatedHighlander
[7:34:09] <Puddin_Wing> that's the impression i get
[7:34:22] <LowRatedHighlander> i gotcha that makes sense
[7:34:22] <praeter15> D: POGLYP
[7:34:33] <siiiif> LowRatedHighlander feeny's busiest time is summer when the soundcloud rappers are off of school Peepo
[7:34:36] <praeter15> gets another uke KEKWait
[7:34:36] <LowRatedHighlander> a lot of tours and stuff go down int he summer so they have more time to make music after its done
[7:34:39] <Puddin_Wing> but yeah a big part of the next couple months will be doing chirstmas albums
[7:34:41] <Puddin_Wing> and i sorta want to die
[7:34:50] <praeter15> fl0m you only need 1 uke KEKWait
[7:35:04] <praeter15> stacking uke only increases range not damage peepoW
[7:35:20] <LowRatedHighlander> feeny is there any alvin in the chipmunks christimas specials comin that we need to know about?
[7:35:26] <LowRatedHighlander> oh god
[7:35:26] <Solank0> Miltiple ukes for range is only good if you want to loop
[7:35:31] <LowRatedHighlander> alvin and the chipmunks
[7:35:33] <LowRatedHighlander> not in peepoW
[7:35:38] <praeter15> Solank0 theyre fighting mithrix peepoSit
[7:35:44] <nuke_cs> sleeeeppyyyy undeafen
[7:35:45] <amutantcookie> @LowRatedHighlander I been away and that's the first message I see WTFF
[7:35:49] <Puddin_Wing> i fuckin wish. I'd trade any one of the 300 versions of Jingle Bell Rock that I've done for an alvin "christmas christmas time is nearrr" @LowRatedHighlander

[7:36:23] <Puddin_Wing> That's careerwide, not this week, i mean
[7:36:29] <Solank0> @praeter15 I know dude, hopefully they can beat it this time. I do want to see them use the no chest ruin though. Makes the runs random and fun
[7:36:29] <Puddin_Wing> i've done that song so many fuckin times in 10 years
[7:36:37] <Puddin_Wing> if I hear it again this year I'm probably gonna snap
[7:36:38] <amutantcookie> @praeter15 I showered this morning shut up
