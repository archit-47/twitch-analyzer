[1:00:23] <andrewmedaTV> he imported some COPIUM from NA
[1:00:26] <andrewmedaTV> US*
[1:00:28] <Pirawks> @MisonS2 we're proud of our sports pain Kappa

[1:00:31] <smeargsy> theyre choketacular
[1:00:32] <Jason6K> And I don’t care
[1:00:34] <lieutent> Leafs basically threw last playoffs.
[1:00:40] <alloy_cs> 18-18
[1:00:40] <kannar_tv> KEKPOINT Leafs
[1:00:41] <smeargsy> 18-19
[1:00:45] <Justhoohaa> AO

[1:53:18] <STatisfacti0n> In reference to the sex position, "69" has become an internet meme, where users will respond to any occurrence of the number with the word "nice" and draw specific attention to it.

[1:53:35] <GoIdenBirb> You can say that I was born to be a Twitch channel mod. I catch a glimpse of copypasta, the adrenaline starts pumping. A whiff of drama, I snap into duty. My streamer calls for a chat ban, I erase that motherfucker from the history books of this channel. There is no !command I won’t code, no timeout I won’t give, no Twitch laws I won’t overlook, and no order I won’t obey to make my streamer happy. And if you become his problem, well, I’m sorry to say that I’ll become yours.

[1:55:03] <STatisfacti0n> Funny, jerking off hasn't really done anything for me in a long time. It often only leads to disappointment and apathy. The satisfaction is mild at best, fleeting and always insufficient. I remember an old clip of Zerkaa saying that for him it feels like peeing, like nothing at all, and I relate to that a lot. The truth is I'm not a coomer, not really. Cooming is a sporadic occasion for me, the urge is often weakened by other needs of body and mind. I'm too tired, too cold, too bored.

[3:58:25] <waferthinmint> @jakenjoi Oh god, id hate that
[3:58:43] <apoodle_> ah ok, i was just wondering, since playing streched would also give one a different vertical than horizontal sens, so it seems to be working fine for a lot of people waferthinmint

[3:59:42] <jakenjoi> @waferthinmint I can't play in stretched res, but in those instances a differential sensitivity would make sense
[3:59:43] <the_kung> @apoodle_ playing stretched doesn't change the horizontal sens, it just looks like it

[4:01:57] <apoodle_> it doesn't change the angular movement, as in a 90 degree turn remains a 90 degree turn, but is does change the horizontal sens in the sense that you're covering more distance on the monitor than you would have with a non-streched one the_kung

[4:12:42] <jakethetank517> our only idea as to why he got VAC'd is someone got access to his account, or something in the background set it off wrongly

[4:48:29] <c0rkmcnortis> fl0m are you telling me you don't want to be slide cancel peeked when holding an angle?
[4:48:30] <sjoerdtheman> Cacemen thats why its fine with me since my bot will bring me ahead of you anyway GIGACHAD
[4:48:30] <KodaRG> @fl0m do you think something like the old aztec colours could help ancient or do you think they should change the agents?
[4:48:36] <waferthinmint> I feel like they could do really really toned down outline like even if it was a flat black outline that just stood out as different texture
[4:48:40] <sleepybyrd> i’m too bad at cs to complain about mechanics or graphics it’s 100% user error on my part
