[0:10:11] <hemo_tox> He basically just has to check in with ESIC ppl for 6 months
[0:10:24] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m TLDR for niko is a warning and monthly esic meeting for 6 months. nothing major
[0:10:34] <hemo_tox> I met hunden in London during the Faceit Major. He came out of a bush and joined me and my friends on our walk to mcdonalds. Whilst we were walking to the mcd he was bragging about how he taught gla1ve everything he knew. Got a picture with him where he made fun of my fnatic jersey. At mcdonalds he took like 10 packs of ketchup. Real asshole. He was pretty drunk.

[2:07:49] <Folsense> Check the file size, could be a limit
[2:07:49] <octoshark191> They're both mp4 files; their names are just different, so the difference must be in the file contents themselves.
[2:07:52] <Mulukky> @fl0m use .mov

[2:42:18] <octoshark191> They probably just didn't think to explicitly indicate to you that it was because it was a Steam issue. They might not have expected you to expect it from them to be honest.

[3:44:07] <Gearslayer360> i wouldnt go to 11 yet @fl0m
[3:44:16] <Andiebie> windows 11?
[3:44:28] <Brosco> windows 11 is not good for gaming especially if you are using AMD
[3:44:38] <3vok3> you gotta wait a couple of months before upgrading
[3:44:41] <RobertCamposs> windowns 11 is full of shit right now
[3:44:43] <quakerkup> you gotta wait for like 2 feature updates usually
[3:44:44] <Brosco> with AMD you are losing about 20ish% with windows 11
[3:44:46] <3vok3> let the bugs debug
[3:44:47] <curpyx> it should be fixed soon tho its like about to be released
[3:44:47] <Andiebie> imma just stick with 10 for rn
[3:44:49] <zellers4> they did and then back peddled
[3:44:49] <Gearslayer360> they gotta make sure all the drivers work @fl0m
[3:44:50] <Booooooolin> any time i do a windows update it fucks my pc so i just dont do it paapoWeird
[3:44:52] <andrewmedaTV> They said Windows 10 was the final Windows
[3:45:04] <theBaboda> @Brosco windows 10 had this same issue with AMD when it launched didn't it?
[3:45:04] <mesutnacar> hi
[3:45:07] <jokkerbo> oh god, OS seasons

[3:45:20] <nanerpus_> tbf 10 was released 6 years ago
[3:45:25] <Andiebie> Am OS battle pass
[3:45:28] <Brosco> @theBaboda probably they tipically colab with Intel
[3:45:30] <NatohTV> do you queue in NA fpl ?
[3:45:35] <KEK_doubleU> theBaboda AMD came up with a fix, its coming with the next patch
[3:45:36] <fluffyrturkey> Absolutely nailed the interview and on to round 3 Pog
[3:45:48] <andrewmedaTV> @fluffyrturkey POGGERS
[3:45:55] <Brosco> but its the standard stuff with new OSs where they just release it and let people test it
[3:45:56] <1_DC> Don't talking please

[5:53:28] <smokadaweeds> @splic3r0 yup they down to advanced
[5:53:33] <whatchu_kno> the exposure to viewers on FPL has gone down a lot maybe the devs will finally try to make some tweaks to make some revenue or reduce the payout
[5:53:59] <lampe_de_salon> is it the same problem in EU?
[5:54:08] <splic3r0> @smokadaweeds Thanks, I dont really watch enough. I used to play invite 1.6 and forgot how entertaining the matches are, getting old sucks :D
[5:54:18] <TheAuditorTV> tbh i dont think ive watched fpl in years
[5:54:18] <sjoerdtheman> lampe_de_salon probably less because of a bigger playerbase
[5:54:29] <bollywoodmajima> I havent seen NA FPL or EU FPL in ages now
[5:54:34] <smokadaweeds> @splic3r0 lol im sure im older :) and yea it does suck
[5:54:37] <cdutchez> eu fpl is entertaining
[5:54:43] <bollywoodmajima> I used to watch the content all the time but I just don't see it anymore
[5:54:47] <lampe_de_salon> @sjoerdtheman yeah that's what i was thinking
[5:54:50] <VashTS1> Ive tried to watch NA fpl but I get bored with it, EU fpl is much better to watch

[6:27:58] <skyj_> nice
[6:28:00] <Zeyzo_> not what I meant KEKW
[6:28:04] <cosmic_sasquatch> @oTTV_BTW esic tweeted out the report

[6:28:46] <originalpirate> when you get blasted 16-1 you dont go "man I think our coach was cheating" KEKW
[6:29:08] <whatchu_kno> thats true its just as a player if you hear a callout from a spot your team has no info, you would question why

[6:29:52] <whatchu_kno> wait so he ratted on himself lol
[6:30:08] <zmiIez> and Astralis still wanted to sign him KEKW good stuff
[6:30:12] <downbadceo> he literally tried to manipulate everyone. ESIC, hltv, heroic, astralis, fucking everyone
[6:30:14] <Rinm> he is playing both sides
[6:30:24] <BizarreMark> peepoW That's some sociopathic shit
[6:30:26] <cosmic_sasquatch> I think a lot of the reason why people want cadiaN and folks to be punished because they are sort of the "villans" of pro CS, because they eliminate underdogs/popular teams.
[6:30:30] <Silent_Dude> hes playing both sides and lost both KEKW Rinm

[6:31:51] <naMas000> @STatisfacti0n cunt ;)
[6:31:52] <silviu_cs> But even if you believe they knew, if you don't have proof it's not ok to ban them without evidence
[6:31:57] <STatisfacti0n> @naMas000 atta boy
[6:32:01] <zmiIez> I mean Tesses boosted him into some spot and claimed not to know...at some point it's too many questions unclear to still let it slide

[6:32:22] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m What was the coaching bug?

[6:32:38] <dweevers> UtkarshJr7 cypher cam basically
[6:32:43] <theaussieprimeminister> Good morning from Australia, dad
[6:32:47] <Pajay_> what was the coaching bug exactly?
[6:32:54] <UtkarshJr7> Ohkk NODDERS @dweevers
[6:33:01] <Uwotm08> You don't need to get boosted to trigger the bug. Also, Hunden had been joking about cheating a lot in the weeks before that. There's no reason to think TeSeS thought that it wasn't another joke.
[6:33:09] <EthanAtor95> the report even says HOUNDEN "observably deliberately fostered and then exploited that trust at a timing that was convenient to him" that's so fucked up
[6:33:12] <zmiIez> oh no 1 doesnt, but to think that we assumed this was 2 maps or 3 and now this, makes you realise that its clearly always the intent to admit bare minimum and risk reputation of the scene, disgusting if you ask me
[6:33:13] <WRXorcist> @pajay_ coach basically had a spectator cam anywhere on the map
[6:33:14] <oTTV_BTW> its too hard to determine for players if they knew or not so kinda gatta throw it out
[6:33:26] <Pajay_> figured. just wasn't sure
[6:33:27] <BizarreMark> peepoW wasn't he kicked from heroic for sharing team strats
[6:33:33] <TweeZer_lewis> @Pajay_ spectator view allowed coaches to view the other teams during a match
[6:33:42] <Pajay_> that's fucked
[6:34:14] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m JoJo lost his verification on twitter KEKW
[6:34:16] <zmiIez> no but the boost allowed for a better point to view from Id guess
[6:34:17] <EthanAtor95> and to do that to someone with Aspergers is just evil

[7:44:19] <mohammadreza99a> @Speedrulez LUL. I say that fl0m hasn't gone to the whole map
[7:44:26] <LowRatedHighlander> mohammadreza99a alright so how this game works is there are different maps for each stage. stage 1 will always choose from like 3 or 4 different maps. you progress to the next stage by activating the teleporter and fighting the boss
[7:44:37] <LowRatedHighlander> once you complete the stage 5 boss you have a choice
[7:44:40] <Speedrulez> mohammadreza99a just giving you shit homie : haha

[7:45:13] <Speedrulez> daaaaaaamn so much damage
[7:45:24] <LowRatedHighlander> ether continue the run by starting over and keeping all your items but going through those 5 stages again with more increasing difficulty or tele to the boss level where you fight a boss to finish the run
[7:45:27] <StormbornVal> he has to just reach lvl 5 right?

[10:37:02] <21jayj> When mythic dota comes out?
[10:37:03] <frogoree> gotcha KEKW
[10:37:07] <Doccy> squad streams don't really support smaller streamers
[10:37:15] <Doccy> when they are streaming with big streamers
[10:37:32] <Doccy> since the view and stuff only count to who the person is watching
[10:37:38] <frogoree> small streams like fl0m need the help Sadge
