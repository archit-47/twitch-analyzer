[0:55:54] <LucidR9> AAAA
[0:55:56] <hobrev> you dont sign hiko to awp for that matter
[0:55:56] <OceanFam> Maybe drop Lucky and sign Fessor
[0:55:57] <kachows> kick bubzkij to get a awper and demote awper to rifle 5Head
[0:55:57] <BoomingBusiness> or IGL for that matter @fl0m Kapp
[0:55:58] <ninetyfivemonkeys> fl0m on monday can you make a JAAAAA emote?
[0:55:58] <KNAPKINAT0R> fl0m to astralis comfirmed?
[0:55:58] <SavouryLobster> AHHHHH
[0:55:58] <Haizur> u sign niko to igl KEKW
[0:55:59] <ree_dash> u underestimate niko'awp

[2:45:06] <hefmeisterr> sounds like valorant
[2:45:09] <4d_printr> and the gamemode for comp halo is dogshit

[2:45:22] <smackey11> nah
[2:45:22] <SithDestroyer1> ya the aim assist in the game is what we call aim lock in every other competitive game LUL @fl0m
[2:45:22] <l3ordon> CS with controller is a great experience
[2:45:22] <Nightbot> Counter-Strike
[2:45:25] <Shimshammie> Has there been any discussion on what's happening with Grim?
[2:45:25] <4d_printr> M+KB is king
[2:45:27] <oTTV_BTW> thats what I said about fortnite
[2:45:28] <brazzerschris> i guess controller is fine if someone can handle it without aim assist
[2:45:28] <HotDishMan> I actually had more fun with splitgate than halo. granted don't player much of either
[2:45:28] <ree_dash> @odiebtw whatchu mean lol
[2:45:29] <Treefi> Believe
[2:45:29] <smackey11> halo is better controller wise
[2:45:31] <cronican> goldeneye had some sick autoaim
[2:45:31] <D1srvpts> I think next major Arden should go back to punk rock look
[2:45:32] <jibbadee> Imagine a cs pro on controller
[2:45:32] <PerhapsItsPeach> I can't believe you'd be such a bigot fl0m how dare you want to segregate inputs like that
[2:45:34] <Treefi> GROUPIUM BOUS
[2:45:35] <jibbadee> that'd be nuts
[2:45:35] <jelbert_uwu> i mean in apex they are both viable but thats just a whole different game
[2:45:35] <makiavelib> To be fair the time to kill is alot longer in halo and call of duty and aim assist just helps that
[2:45:36] <harshith_yellanki> is this the 16-12 script
[2:45:37] <RhinoIsSus> Vertigo is a tough TL map
[2:45:39] <MistxrWSP> Does Grim go back to a tier 2 team after this event?
[2:45:39] <LowRatedHighlander> fl0m I‚Äôll be honest I play MKB ranked on cross play (you can choose what inputs you play against) and it‚Äôs honestly not that bad. I got placed diamond

[6:25:55] <ancalagon9608> you see zywoo play, and you feel he's the best player. but somehow s1mple has the same impact, I just think he has a lot less flashy plays now.
[6:25:59] <HeyKroZ_> COPIUM
[6:25:59] <dankiyy> oh mine just came in COPIUM
[6:26:03] <elemzee_> have u ever played with someone and been like fuck ur good at getting eco kills
[6:26:05] <1KERY> @DillyyDally i see that but i think the misses he does just makes their situations much harder and he does it a lot, i mean when i watch G2 play. but u are right he has a good match now
[6:26:06] <trashthalk> Copium withdrawals
[6:26:06] <twaisz> we gotta refill fast before tmmrw
[6:26:10] <gupta_rishabh> do you think it's time for a new counterstrike game ?
[6:26:14] <BSODslayer> @fl0m They've kinda' got the luxury problem of Amanek being almost "good enough" for them to not have to find a replacement AWP'er like-oh-god-yesterday-srsly-hurry, and so it gets kicked down the road, priority-wise... Anyway, just my 2 cents. :)
[6:26:16] <SoporificPanda> we had to open the Strategic Copium Reserve

[6:28:08] <yavin04> EVOLVE SUCKED
[6:28:09] <EdgyKommunist> half life Alyx was *Chefs kiss*
[6:28:09] <StochasticDiscount> Epic bought Autochess
[6:28:19] <StochasticDiscount> And Valve had to scramble to make a game
[6:28:20] <YUGNOVY> HF Alyx was so good
[6:28:20] <dankiyy> valve buying others creations, unheard of
[6:28:21] <christicall> yea they tried
[6:28:26] <HeyKroZ_> do you accept payment in Hopium  1KERY  ?
[6:28:31] <nuxvo> @EdgyKommunist was it tho?

[6:29:04] <Just_Melo> It's a VR game the bar isn't high
[6:29:06] <mamluku> even with its issues half life alyx was great
[6:29:08] <EdgyKommunist> @nuxvo if you like HL games, yes it was
[6:29:11] <HotChocolate_> half life alyx did exactly what it was supposed to: sell indexes
[6:29:15] <1KERY> @HeyKroZ_ yeah but the dose should be doubled so 1 COPIUM for 2 Hopium
[6:29:26] <Just_Melo> A real Half Life game would have been better
[6:29:42] <brazzerschris> VR is so overrated (excluding porn)
[6:29:47] <YUGNOVY> I love what they did with Alyx
[6:29:48] <nuxvo> @EdgyKommunist word I haven't played it yet, but im looking forward to it
[6:29:49] <diamonndcc> valve is such a shit developer, shame to have such a nice game and not use it to full potential
[6:29:50] <DrIsaac> im willing to wait 10 5-10 more years until i get into VR stuff, it'll be so much better

[6:31:18] <dankiyy> can we get a rocket launcher volvo
[6:31:21] <devourerplz> @fl0m what if they swapped *all* the maps out for new ones every year
[6:31:22] <MiraiShikimi> Ancient came out a year ago, so that would mean 2 more maps coming out now

[7:13:02] <4Snails> thats just dumb
[7:13:09] <HotChocolate_> they say "operator" instead of "Op"

[7:13:10] <n9nelashes> poor val casters
[7:13:10] <ninetyfivemonkeys> encouraged by who? riot or the orgs?
[7:13:15] <dankiyy> vansilli mentioned they are free to use what they want, but opt for ability names
[7:13:19] <jjuddahh> Uniracers stream when???
[7:13:22] <diamonndcc> beacause valorant is too stressed out about CS, cuz they can t get it to die with their new cartoon game LUL

[7:14:02] <STatisfacti0n> @MinwFPS ah fuck bud you did end up having a reaction Sadge
[7:14:12] <christicall> i remember they called it the 'operator' to have similarity between 'op' and 'awp' just to ban the caster from using the short term
[7:14:14] <mamluku> are they allowed to say gun on valo streams?
[7:14:14] <STatisfacti0n> @MinwFPS I felt like garbage yesterday but other than some minor ache in my arm I'm good today

[13:45:53] <Doccy> you could be the first penis on twitch
[13:45:56] <sloveCS> junior also had a really rough series
[13:46:02] <LowRatedHighlander> It‚Äôs out there waiting to be taken NODDERS
[13:46:04] <Floofys> Aww man Eidolon hunting was one of my favorite things to do
[13:46:29] <LowRatedHighlander> I swear one map junior looks like simple and then the next he‚Äôs asleep
[13:46:40] <sloveCS> it was disappointing too, i saw him make a lot of mistakes multiple times and he kept dying the same way
[13:46:41] <LtNotzoClutch> KEKWait Wait... whatever happened to the notFl0m channel? Have I been sleeping on that channel or we not streaming there much?
[13:47:02] <c_killem797> so...
[13:47:02] <LowRatedHighlander> @ltnotzoclutch still there he just hasn‚Äôt streamed on it in a while
[13:47:03] <caffeinetx> @sloveCS jonji was too aggro to a fault. i loved some of it and the info plays but he did it seemingly round after round and it was also just too readable.
[13:47:07] <crazylostk> @fl0m Thanks for the gift sub!
[13:47:12] <LowRatedHighlander> Had a lot of stuff going on in the main channel
[13:47:17] <Floofys> I gotta say it is really fun Watching a non-warframe streamer stream Warframe
[13:47:23] <c_killem797> Party astronauts... did they continue to get dog walked, or nah?
[13:47:26] <crazylostk> run out for dinner and come back to a git sub. thanks!

[13:47:50] <LtNotzoClutch> You've been mad busy tho. It's hard to find time for family and friends, PLUS keep up with the occasional 2nd channel
[13:48:05] <caffeinetx> jonji had a 6 month run where he was the NA king of Banana on inferno and BnB looked incredible on it and then it became the worst map they play sloveCS
[13:48:06] <caffeinetx> imo
[13:48:24] <sloveCS> it can work both ways @caffeinetx  when it worked it was great when it didnt he looked terrible. he's an extremely skilled player so vs most NA teams he looked incredible. vs better opponents he couldnt do the same stuff
[13:48:49] <sloveCS> but they are missing some of that aggressiveness now
[13:48:51] <c_killem797> FUCK IT. I'LL CHECK IT ONLINE.
