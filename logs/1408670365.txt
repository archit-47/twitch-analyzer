[3:56:50] <erk12> KEKW i forgot about that
[3:56:50] <Puddin_Wing> yeah, they sorta had to end it like that to set up season 2. My big fear for season 2 now is that they only KNEW they had 2 seasons, so they're gonna try to do the whole chroma conclave in 1 season @Speedrulez
[3:56:52] <BeauxGnar> that was an odd timeline
[3:56:53] <Puddin_Wing> which would be a bummer
[3:56:59] <LibraH_tv> that was a bizarre time
[3:57:01] <Zainathan> that kid just said HeyGuys

[4:56:46] <Jorty__> jks is too talented to not be on a top team :(
[4:56:48] <LowRatedHighlander> fair enough
[4:56:50] <LucidR9> every single roster that niko has been on that has choked a major final has also had a particular boznian star rifler, coincidence? I think not
