[0:07:35] <drivel___> Go into your steam library, go down to where is says “splitgate” press play and that should fix your issues
[0:07:37] <SupraUK_> maybe it's patching locally instead of downloading
[0:07:39] <Tvjuli> Have you considered downloading the game?
[0:07:51] <SupraUK_> @Tvjuli we'll do that as a last resort
[0:07:52] <LucidR9> we back

[1:31:46] <praeter15> forsenCD not every game
[1:31:56] <LucidR9> yeah because 90% of cs pros cheat right fl0m
[1:32:00] <LucidR9> atleast 90%
[1:32:03] <beranabus__> not a single game out there worth playing that doesn't suffer from cheaters

[1:32:08] <FUMAiDORME> @praeter15 and no audio, cheaters, ddosers
[1:32:12] <LowRatedHighlander> i dont see cheaters in TFT thats all im saying paapoWeird
[1:32:20] <Leems> Apex shouldn't have cheaters now that it's on steam and is thus protected by the greatest anti-cheat software out there: VAC.
[1:32:21] <priiide_> fl0m apex's highest rank is essentially unplayable, kinda like GE in CS but there isnt faceit
[1:32:25] <praeter15> imagine not blasting music when playing this game KEKPOINT
[1:32:39] <Artsywyo> So happy Apex is on steam
[1:32:46] <FUMAiDORME> i do blast music, but i also like to hear when people are rushing me from behind :)
[1:32:50] <praeter15> you cant cheat on VAC secured server

[1:33:21] <LucidR9> I dont understand, simply make cheating against the rules, and then people cant do it
[1:33:24] <siiiif> Apex shares servers with CS so theyre VAC secured

[4:09:38] <dims_cs> @c0rkmcnortis two things came to mind, check your power cables for your CPU/GPU are connected right, or your CPU thermal paste might need changing

[4:10:18] <c0rkmcnortis> dims_cs my thermals are fine, beefy aftermarket cooler. all other games are no issue. only thing i can think of is my pretty mild overclock but that shouldn't kill me this bad
[4:10:21] <dims_cs> i used to have low fps and stutters in apex/cs, solved itself after changing thermal paste and getting a better cooler than stock
