[0:38:55] <ImTarco> No fl0m, accept my objective statement.
[0:38:57] <greenteasake> Servers still receive maintenance though, hence scheduled down times
[0:39:04] <iizarian> nah you never should have to reboot servers, unless you are upgrading something that requires it
[0:39:06] <Archit47> it can be possible in the future tho iizarian
[0:39:07] <chaeriz9> After a game is done the server restarts automatically i think
[0:39:08] <w33dsack> FEelsBadMan we know

[0:39:10] <AMutantCookie> especially bios updates

[1:09:01] <BillzKa> Dude I'll never understand How much "Cristobal Colón's" name changes depending on the language, like, how did you guys know him as Christopher Columbus LMAO
[1:09:01] <LucidR9> almost too easy
[1:09:04] <justdanny> did you guys know that most of the chairs/benches in airports are herman millers?
[1:09:06] <Koogle> almost!
[1:09:08] <Koogle> some would say
[1:09:08] <Neverbloomed> I managed to snag a $1400 Herman off FB Marketplace for 15$ last year
[1:09:12] <c_killem797> @t_swenie94 I'm glad I'm not the only one that can never find the clippers. LUL LUL LUL
[1:09:13] <LucidR9> BillzKa this is a weird take
[1:09:15] <STatisfacti0n> I don't want to talk away from their deal, but it's also worth looking into the used market as well for Herman Miller chairs. lots of companies buy up a bunch of them when they start up and then if they go under, they sell them for a good price. you can get lightly used and even brand new chairs for like half the price (without the manufacture warranty of course)
[1:09:16] <LucidR9> wtf sort of
[1:09:17] <justdanny> saw their logo on the chairs last time i was in the airport
[1:09:23] <Neverbloomed> the lady selling it got it at an office auctions and just wanted it gone KEKW
[1:09:27] <LucidR9> Dude I'll never understand How much "Cristobal Colón's" name changes depending on the language, like, how did you guys know him as Christopher Columbus LMAO
[1:09:31] <sjason2007> if I had 800 to spend on a chair, I would for sure get one
[1:09:37] <BillzKa> @lucidr9 dude was Spanish, how did you guys change it so much
[1:09:41] <BillzKa> LOL
[1:09:41] <STatisfacti0n> take away*
[1:09:43] <LucidR9> by translating it
[1:09:45] <sen_sh1> give him the nt fl0m
[1:09:46] <TheCatLady> @sukksgaming I included you, too, dear.
[1:09:46] <wallmanm> Offices are constantly buying new ones and throwing out their old for cheap look around
[1:09:47] <LucidR9> like most other things
[1:09:51] <imweaselTV> @Neverbloomed Classic. Love buying expensive stuff off marketplace from people who dont really know what they are selling.
[1:10:01] <toastisalie> It's never worth cheaping out on your back, no matter how much you are saving. If you spend more than 2 hours a day at your desk then you should really invest into something that will help your posture.
[1:10:04] <Neverbloomed> @wallmanm big facts thahts how I got mine
[1:10:06] <ImTarco> I did the same Stat. Got an Aeron with the armrest upgrades for $400 used. Insane deal.

[1:23:28] <gmor_> i beg to differ Kappa
[1:23:37] <greenteasake> kyojin and misuta couldn't hold their own, wherever they were at is where Vitality's defense would break down, I agree with you in that they're not bad players but they need to be consistent in order to compete with NaVi
[1:23:39] <LucidR9> astralis bad team overrated

[1:59:14] <sweminy> a732v I heard "giveaways all the time" too
[1:59:16] <PeskyPhoenix> Speaking of giveaways, I find it ironic that people who would normally not even read a title before entering a chat and asking "what game is this?" suddenly become literate when GIVEAWAY is in the title KEKW
[1:59:17] <Cake315> promise us better content ^^
[1:59:21] <Kafkii> Give mod away so you can finally unmod wookie
[1:59:22] <sol1taire> he can promise giving away hsi cock

[2:18:42] <Tommy_The_Elite> im disappointed in cs money, every skin, is like yo you get a great deal and then you look at the steam markets and you are getting scammed hard, over paying like crazy over steam prices

[2:22:23] <waferthinmint> people who think other skin trading sites are going to have better deals most likely arent looking at the full scope of their inventory. usually "better deal's" are balanced with worse ones else where in their inventory. No body is running charity skin site.
[2:22:25] <Tommy_The_Elite> i think they get scammed, by market hikes then cant really loser the price

[2:32:03] <Tommy_The_Elite> @sang_dt25 true, but alas its easier for someone to drop their honor and morals and cheat, i think that game companies do the best that they can, i like more external cheat detection, if the anti cheat isnt made by the game company then its normally good
