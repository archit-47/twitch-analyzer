[5:08:34] <TheRock_as> @fl0m look at  KRIMZ's twitter PepeLaugh
[5:08:35] <Roya1tyCS> why would they drop krimz?
[5:08:37] <ZeremyK> Karrigan has a wild card every map. He goes "CYKA BLYAT" and his whole team has to rush B no matter what
[5:08:40] <m_adar_a1> My dad remembers Krimz. So you know his time is coming
[5:08:42] <Speedrulez> YEP it is a real trophy now @LucidR9 the way chelsea and liverpool fought about it made something to be real proud about

[5:11:14] <Speedrulez> @LucidR9 i have no clue why poch would be the move. Ten Hag would amazing
[5:11:16] <renchons> this performance lowkey makes JKS look like a god, probably should help him find a team
[5:11:17] <plf09> - who for Brollan? Has to be plopski
[5:11:18] <polkastar1> Would you have said that about jks before Katowice?
[5:11:20] <rubberducky112989> does JKS not want to play on an NA team? Seems like he makes the most sense to go to EG or Liquid
[5:11:21] <looked_157> where do we vote for the mvp??
[5:11:22] <k7ylp> reckon he would join my pug faceit team if i offer him a crate of fosters
[5:11:22] <PockettAces> throw some respect on Broky
[5:11:22] <Nacktschneckekatze> NiKo's beard Kreygasm
[5:11:22] <iTysonator252> @gkimball86 Yeah it’s just really unfortunate
[5:11:25] <markdezy> i dont get why people say jks doesnt have a team.  he plays for complexity....am i missing something?
[5:11:27] <TurtlesFly> I feel like NiKo isn't so spectacular this match tbh

[5:11:36] <Bestplayer733> I’m guessing JKS are his initials so what’s his middle name?
[5:11:37] <McScuffed> yeah
[5:11:38] <pinksoda> but most likley esetag
[5:11:38] <Trev_NA> @rubberducky112989 They're not good enough for him. He doesn't deserve that
[5:11:40] <mattinglymoo> 1.3 so far
[5:11:40] <xBomBaYx> You think there's any chance an of the international rosters will carry a 6th man?

[5:48:47] <Speedrulez> @F1niteCS what a game though. could have gone either way
[5:48:48] <LevelfiveVegan> HUNTER WAS +23 people GIVE THAT MAN SOME RESPECT
[5:48:48] <sStauskas> i think broky had more impact than jks
[5:48:54] <greazywook> You think kar gets a better batman mask
[5:48:54] <SupraUK_> i deserve the trophy, thoughts?
[5:48:56] <YuutsuUK> @BSODslayer seems about right
[5:49:01] <stalty_plays> JKS MVP, man came in as a stand in for two different rolls and crushed it. He was the top rated entry fragger during the groups
[5:49:01] <onitchief> is rain gonna get a medal?

[5:49:08] <sasha_0x01> Karrigan one of the best IGLs in the world, jks the best stand-in in the world, ropz joins faze and instantly wins a tournament, twistzz back to being a superstar and broky was a fuckin' revelation. GGs to FaZe, what a grand final

[5:54:40] <EmkayTheIV> @JHdash77 KEKW true
[5:54:40] <sasha_0x01> Karrigan one of the best IGLs in the world, jks the best stand-in in the world, ropz joins faze and instantly wins a tournament, twistzz back to being a superstar and broky was a fuckin' revelation. GGs to FaZe, what a grand final
[5:54:45] <WoodenBird> I am pretty sure carlos said on hltv confirmend they had one
[5:54:47] <TacticalAlmonds> is G2 going through the liquid phase of just finishing top 4 at all tournaments but not winning anything?
[5:54:53] <fluidfirexx> this was a crazy show
[5:54:59] <gumgum1357> @fl0m niko need mental training
