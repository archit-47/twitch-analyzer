[1:59:15] <miras_hair_tie> @bamfckingboozled i think its because the pulses only effect you for those 4 seconds, when youre outside the range of the pulses it doesnt effect you
[1:59:17] <cruxqx> @bamfckingboozled it pulses
[1:59:18] <Mohphi> @bamfckingboozled Because it does 4 seconds per pulse, so if you stay in it, it's gonna refresh each pulse. But if you only get hit by one pulse, it'll only b 4 seconds
