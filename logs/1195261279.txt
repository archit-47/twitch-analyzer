[0:36:46] <c_killem797> he had a short term contract. only a few months.
[0:36:54] <Deathmatchen> i still kinda wish jerry jones didnt sell complexity
[0:36:57] <STatisfacti0n> I'd join CoL if it weren't for the fact that they're tied together with the Dallas fucking Cowboys
[0:36:57] <yobtih> Cold got 16-0’d twice and left
[0:36:58] <STatisfacti0n> fuck the cowboys
[0:36:59] <yobtih> My man

[0:37:41] <Puddin_Wing> oh ok
[0:37:45] <adlazear> I would get mixed up between the complexity logo and the cowboys logo
[0:37:48] <crocswsocks> 1tap
[0:37:49] <STatisfacti0n> I want a new c9 roster Sadge
[0:37:53] <linoleumpro> when is match friday
[0:37:53] <Puddin_Wing> bntet is nutty but every team he gets put in falls apart immediately
[0:37:59] <frogoree> server full? PauseFish
[0:38:07] <goldenlogic23> @linoleumpro check hltv
[0:38:28] <praeter15> what if C9 picked up Fallen and Cold and then maybe pick up those new Brazilian up and comers i think theyre named Fer and Taco and then maybe pick up an old 1.6 legend like FNX
[0:38:28] <D1srvpts> I’m still Rainge that I got booted from the server
[0:38:30] <PimentacoCS> relatively cheap
[0:38:38] <yobtih> CIS are just really good at pointing and clicking
[0:38:41] <relaption> device was a milly alone right
[0:38:49] <Scavenger_0> Esetag 1 million PepeLaugh
[0:38:53] <SupraUK_> hey fl0m can i borrow $500k to $750k
[0:39:00] <Deathmatchen> the new complexity owners paid 23 million in stock, i think they can easily afford flames
[0:39:01] <praeter15> SupraUK_ i got you
[0:39:06] <notjamessss> hey fl0m can i borrow $500k to $750k
[0:39:08] <Madfish2021> According to hltv its 500k to 750k for the full roster. Device cost 1M + on his own lol
[0:39:23] <acey091> will they still be called CPH Flames after ibuypower snags em
[0:39:26] <SoporificPanda> damn just imagine for 500,000 mcdoubles you could own CPH Flames
[0:39:31] <lakesidegameing> flames is playing so good kinda worth the top 10 placement
[0:39:33] <NebChilly> cph almost made playoffs thats a steal
[0:39:37] <Scavenger_0> KEKWiggle
[0:39:41] <yobtih> Hey fl0m. Long time sub here. I’ve bought you your house could you help me buy flames.
[0:39:42] <tribbiani_> worth Kappa
[0:39:47] <trashthalk> HAMPUS LETSGO
[0:39:47] <praeter15> but has Flames won 4 majors peepoSit
[0:39:47] <adlazear> flames is a very good team
[0:39:53] <Madfish2021> A top 10 roster for 500K is quite cheap
[0:39:55] <lakesidegameing> sell my house and buy flames
[0:39:55] <hyperstef> COBBLE LETSGO
[0:39:59] <Deathmatchen> hampus was looking like his old self yesterday
[0:40:03] <tribbiani_> @madfish2021 true
[0:40:12] <SoporificPanda> call jason lake
[0:40:15] <dankiyy> are they actively trying to sell the roster?
[0:40:21] <Anouar_Here> !res
[0:40:21] <Nightbot> 2560×1440 16:9
[0:40:26] <5Rule_> Buy hampus for mythic. STONKS
[0:40:28] <brainlessxyz> surely c9 swoops up that roster
[0:40:42] <ItsAho> If all subs could pitch in $100 we could buy flames
[0:40:43] <filipcash> @fl0m if col went what about coldzera?
[0:40:47] <notjamessss> We need tsm to get to cs
[0:40:50] <STatisfacti0n> @brainlessxyz I'd be happy with c9 buying it
[0:40:55] <SoporificPanda> made the team too good and can't afford them. suffering from success PepeHands
[0:41:00] <yobtih> I think they are good but I do wonder if it was a Cinderella run
[0:41:01] <relaption> thats what flames is as an org honestly just develop talent and sell for profit

[1:01:26] <ScarZJ> hospital socks are so comfy tarikPray
[1:01:26] <Dynamo_Dave> a hotdog in the UK is generally a lot more singular in the types of meat mashed together.

[1:23:00] <ShallowSloth> i was in columbus pretty much all day today fl0m
[1:23:02] <Apeiron_TV> gotta do a question mark after the %
[1:23:14] <stormshitman> i saw triptik meme it the other day but no The ultimate budget fl0m is if triptik and JasonR had a kid
[1:23:17] <izab3ru> RoR2 Let's go
[1:23:21] <Puddin_Wing> HEY YOU FUCKIN ANIMALS BEHAVE YOURSELVES
[1:23:23] <Dynamo_Dave> yea. but I don't like joris
[1:23:24] <Puddin_Wing> I got it covered
[1:23:37] <ShallowSloth> every time i go to cbus theres a bunch of cars broken down on the side of the road
[1:23:48] <Apeiron_TV> I can never behave myself, for I am The Great Guantonolohongerogongus
[1:24:02] <blobistickk> Flom one of the best streamers and youtubers on site lets go!
[1:24:03] <Puddin_Wing> rofl that's my #1 way of describing that city. Every time i've ever driven through, there's been a car on fire on the side of the highway @ShallowSloth
[1:24:04] <LeBoomstickPBP> How did my brain understand that?
[1:24:11] <Puddin_Wing> every time
[1:24:15] <LeBoomstickPBP> @apeiron_tv you make no goddamn sense and i get it
[1:24:28] <Apeiron_TV> yes
[1:24:29] <ShallowSloth> yeah idk why that is, i never see any cars on the side of the road in cleveland, only columbus
[1:24:40] <Puddin_Wing> because cleveland isn't a dumpster fire
[1:24:50] <LeBoomstickPBP> Blue Jackets fans?? I could see it
[1:25:00] <ShallowSloth> probably cus no one can afford a car in cleveland
[1:25:07] <ShallowSloth> too busy buying heroin
[1:25:12] <huronvalley21> oh how I hate Ohio st!!
[1:25:15] <Apeiron_TV> my brain is 960% built different
[1:25:25] <Silkjackel222> sloth in clevelqnd the cars left on the side of the road get stolen
[1:25:31] <ShallowSloth> true
[1:25:42] <LeBoomstickPBP> My brain somehow lets me talk fast with near perfection for 3 hours on command, its weird
[1:25:44] <Dynamo_Dave> the town I live outside of is known for ice cream and crystal meth
[1:25:50] <LeBoomstickPBP> Niiiice
[1:25:57] <Puddin_Wing> that car on fire bit is genuinely true though. I haven't driven through cbus that many times, but every time i have there's been one
[1:26:07] <ShallowSloth> is it like a buy one get one Dynamo_Dave
[1:26:12] <Puddin_Wing> last time i drove through there i think i was goign to cleveland to see thrice and Brand New
[1:26:15] <Puddin_Wing> which was a hell of a show
[1:26:24] <LeBoomstickPBP> I’ve only seen one car on fire and it was in New Jersey on an interstate
