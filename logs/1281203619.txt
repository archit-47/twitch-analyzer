[0:53:48] <karNA_69> EG igl?
[0:53:49] <Arrivall> I want AK on CT side unless I'm holding like solo site then I want A1 to smoke spam and use one-ways.

[0:56:45] <angus799> @aobman takes 19s for Ts to go from top banana to A site lmao they can still fake with 25s. the fact youre arguing that playing 1v4 on A is a good idea is a joke.

[0:57:03] <angus799> easy for FaZe
[0:57:05] <ninetyfivemonkeys> the thing is, csgo devs arent pro cs players. so they make a change and basically wait for the pro scene to figure out the meta.
[0:57:05] <hobrev> "lets not pick inferno"
[0:57:06] <piboy417> I have no idea how valve can make the guns perfectly ballanced, becasue at the highest level tiny differences will make everyone use the same gun
[0:57:06] <Darkoplax> Liquid win Prayge Karrigan flop Prayge
[0:57:07] <Arrivall> Bring back old A1S fire rate and make it 5 shot body and $3600 @fl0m

[2:03:43] <Aallesklaarr> astralis wasnt good on mirage before though
[2:03:44] <iVex> LETSGO
[2:03:45] <j1t5s> Navi got Liquid’d, break ruined them
[2:03:49] <angus799> @fl0m everyone knows dont play dust2 in BO1
[2:03:50] <h4ze16> @fl0m thought they could overpower them without giving away any new ideas they have on other maps?
[2:03:52] <Call_Me_Moldzyn> @ninetyfivemonkeys  true , but all in all faze's losing a lot of duels here, which shouldnt be the case
[2:03:52] <Reeekae> Navi actually took a player break... They didn't have a roster shuffle so no need to grind like the other teams did.

[2:04:18] <ninetyfivemonkeys> fl0m i feel like in any situation when a top 5 team is playing a top 60 team they should just veto mirage d2 cause they are so dependent on individual performance no?

[2:04:19] <NZfaded> I could get usee to fl0m comm

[2:30:36] <avellichor> atleast liquid look decent? i guess
[2:30:42] <xisplo> it was a good game, this faze core has played together longer than liquid so this is a fair result for liquid

[3:24:58] <andrewmedaTV> @angus799 VAC is a reactive learning anticheat. It is not proactive
[3:24:58] <Patchhes> If someone were to buy Valve it would be 100b+.
[3:24:59] <Ficii> @angus799 I guess it's because it doesn't detect the program itself, and valve wants people to confirm it's a spinbot

[3:25:05] <apoodle_> a company as profitable as valve is practically a univorn, it's incredibly valuable
[3:25:09] <Patchhes> They're definitely worth more than Actiblizz.
[3:25:15] <MiraiShikimi> can you turn up slasher?
[3:25:15] <Lekr0DeRuS> gotta love people forming opinions in bo1 matches
[3:25:18] <thefl1pdof> PepePls WE LOVE FORTNITE PepePls
[3:25:19] <vtec_kicked_in__yo> 69 B good sir
[3:25:20] <Patchhes> BNet is worse Steam.
[3:25:28] <Cake315> wait faze is really strong against vitality?
[3:25:28] <CrovvCSGO> @fl0m Candy Crush aswell
[3:25:30] <TacticalAlmonds> I heard new AC is actually really good
[3:25:32] <Krouching_Cangaroo> volvo will care about csgo COPIUM
[3:25:33] <zoofuu_> Forbes estimates Gabe at $3.9b
[3:25:34] <Thirdothy> total equity was $10 bill in 2019 before COVID so prolly skyrocketed
[3:25:35] <boan_cs> @fl0m i mean if you look at the game supreme commander the devs left the game and so the community made a way to still play it with others and it still has a big following
[3:25:37] <ShouvikXIV> 1
[3:25:39] <nanerpus_> warzone is not the value at Activision. King is the real money maker
[3:25:40] <Darkoplax> Riot > Valve > Blizzard
[3:25:40] <sloveCS> i dont think ive ever heard anyone ask to turn up slasher before
[3:25:41] <LucidR9> TacticalAlmonds richochet is ok
[3:25:44] <McBubba03> FaZe owning rn
[3:25:44] <angus799> @andrewmedaTV yes i know but at no point has any progress been made with it, let it learn and react accordingly
[3:25:48] <Radianas> 100+ billions
[3:25:49] <ChosenDew> fl0m blizzard's real money maker is candy crush
[3:25:50] <SupraUK_> at least 5bn amirite
[3:25:52] <Ficii> riot>valve KEKW
[3:25:53] <Paasss> I put Valve way higher
[3:25:54] <td_gg> the csgo steam market alone makes more money than wow for sure
[3:25:58] <Cake315> valve makes the best games it just takes them 20years
[3:26:00] <Patchhes> Steam alone is probably worth as much as ATVI
[3:26:02] <kimole171081> @tacticalalmonds looks terrible even tho.🙈
[3:26:02] <achleyash> riot has league yk
[3:26:07] <TacticalAlmonds> LucidR9 maybe some streamers I watch are just white labeled

[4:30:19] <andrewmedaTV> I mean I understand why Inferno. All the teams are new and are not comfortable on any maps yet so they just go Inferno
[4:30:22] <fixture_city> :)
[4:30:22] <neyook> people forget how good auti was
[4:30:23] <GaTor86_> FaZe has played 2 inferno matches in a row now and both ended in overtime. THEY ARE FUCKING TIRED OF THAT MAP
[4:30:28] <natkhat_shinigami> Cera tilts even harder @fl0m
[4:30:31] <angus799> @D1srvpts issue is some teams are overpass gods so as new teams everyone learns inferno
[4:30:32] <VERBALL___> !mouse
[4:30:32] <Nightbot> fl0m's peripherals and other gear are here: https://pastebin.com/rBv4ck0G

[4:31:08] <Krouching_Cangaroo> its inferno Sadge ο ο ο ( Gambage )
[4:31:10] <GaTor86_> but they came back the first map
[4:31:10] <zremmyz> officials have a different feel and I think once everyone gets comfortable in officials EG can pop off
[4:31:13] <neyook> like after everyone left
[4:31:16] <Justhoohaa> at least karrigan isnt choking in finals anymore CrungoSmile
[4:31:16] <Darkoplax> another inferno ? god have mercy ...

[4:31:21] <Crokpot57> Ill be honest. Id rather watch another inferno than any D2 @fl0m
[4:31:22] <wreck_it_reek> there should be a bet on the next match on if it will be inferno or not
[4:31:26] <irnak2> inferno again no shot
[4:31:28] <berxwed4n> EG and Liquid both gonna throw to skip NaVi as 4th at elimination bracket @fl0m

[6:00:00] <valar1003> @Willis225 lucky can hit too, he just never attempts
[6:00:01] <TheRock_as> Osee could become NAs best player
[6:00:05] <ChaoticRenny> Liquid finally has an awper
[6:00:08] <4d_printr> I believe so much in EG man, they had some good looks this game
[6:00:09] <CrovvCSGO> Lucky has good mechanics, but he's like a puppy instead of a wolf.

[6:00:26] <pilotDesperado> why is lucky like that tho? is it the team's culture and standards
[6:00:29] <LuxionGames> is it just me or do the EG and LIQUID jerseys look very similar
[6:00:34] <BSODslayer> @fl0m he did show a glimmer of hope in the match you missed yesterday actually - still faaaar from enough, but you know... 😅
[6:00:46] <CheapPizzaBox> ask tarik if i thinks its inferno

[6:37:30] <Zola1712> mirage maybe
[6:37:33] <klaxon419> Ancient
[6:37:34] <CrovvCSGO> Ancient
[6:37:36] <AFugy> both faze and liquid map bans have the same path
[6:37:36] <CrovvCSGO> I would say
[6:37:37] <sen_sh1> I’d rather watch mirage now
[6:37:43] <Paasss> Broky looks like he's also done with inferno today
[6:37:53] <Vertaro> Can they make the next game mandatory train?
[6:37:53] <iTysonator252> I feel like faze is good at both ancient and mirage
[6:37:56] <jrol4> Why not Dust 2?
[6:38:00] <m1cgg> true, but with ropz they get a more reliable site holder

[8:36:32] <Tvjuli> what happened
[8:36:32] <Fyxtro_live> Was doubting between 1440p 165hz and 1080p 240hz
[8:36:34] <clakrs> imagione 60hz when 144hz monitors are like the same price now
[8:36:34] <infinite077> Still on 60hz FeelsBadMan
[8:36:36] <siiiif> i game on 60hz 4k peepoSit

[8:36:38] <Doccy> would you get another curved monitor though fl0m
[8:36:40] <ezekt123> Is this Vertigo KEKW
[8:36:41] <cryptoc1> I went 60 to 144+gsync, completely changed gaming for me
[8:36:41] <Crokpot57> i went from 60hz to 240 and my eyes hurt how good it is
[8:36:43] <MyKeey_T> went from 60 to 240 found a killer deal
[8:36:44] <blazing0n10n> I played on my friend's 144hz monitor and I hated my 60hz monitor for a while after
[8:36:46] <BoftinRowswell> I've never played on anything over 60hz because I'm poor
[8:36:46] <LucidR9> Doccy real monitors have curves NODDERS
[8:36:47] <NKG_1> i went from playing on 60 to 240, it's great
[8:36:48] <CORN3e> if that is middle ground what is high?
[8:36:51] <DesiredHeadshot> made the move to 240 will never go back
[8:36:51] <Helmss_> ima bout to go to my friends to play a val tourney this next weekend and I'm going from 240hz to 144hz it might be rough
[8:36:56] <Sun__House> "240hz + 1440p"  "middle ground"  fl0m truly is a man of the people
[8:36:56] <Bolly> Odyssey G7 also supports Freesync Premium Pro, which is nice for AMD users
[8:37:01] <CortanaLXIX> curved is nice

[8:39:43] <ScoutPack151> @Lordaaaaa Me too, man. Its time for Faze to rise up again COPIUM
[8:39:55] <GreavenTV> Faze can 100% lose this
[8:39:55] <Dynamo_Dave> who won the eg/liquid game?
[8:39:56] <BeepTheSheep_> @fl0m not curious about 360hz?

[8:40:01] <siiiif> OneOfUs
[8:40:04] <SandwichSundays> 4k 240fps sounds unrealistic without a 3090 or something

[8:40:55] <Alexeous> 240hz + dyac > 390hz
[8:40:55] <c_killem797> but I feel like, historically, vitality has been way better than faze on overpass. so was astralis. I feel like this isn't a map they should be struggling to win.
[8:40:55] <vis9ns> im veiNote taking notes
[8:40:56] <reformed_devide> who do you think has higher ceiling EG or liquid
