[0:13:44] <AverageMauo> thats a good point to make
[0:13:44] <minded_> zonic coaching and apex igl is weird to me
[0:13:45] <hobrev> was just about to ask the same :D
[0:13:46] <hemo_tox> Zonic is gonna get scared of Apex's mald KEKW
[0:13:46] <danitoou> nah apex will probably do it
[0:13:47] <Jordanlg> Broky to G2 vamosW
[0:13:49] <Shimshammie> I just saw this too
[0:13:52] <nebel_rock> HYPED!
[0:13:52] <Darra5> Is this is a joke?
[0:13:53] <1nche5> zywoo do not speak very good english...
[0:13:54] <GlowzuS> Will be a 5 start malding team KEKW
[0:13:56] <AverageMauo> apex isnt a bad igl at all
[0:13:56] <sleeeeppyyyy> a french danish team. who wouldve thought KEKWait
[0:13:59] <zafzx> EG needs to disband there cs roster and concentrate on valorant
[0:14:00] <Jawsome159> Yeah comms is the thing, but can’t see anyone there underperforming skill wise
[0:14:01] <Shimshammie> Holy fuck
[0:14:03] <f3bbs_> hasnt apex only been on french teams only?
[0:14:03] <yobtih> it's the language that's gunna have it not work
[0:14:03] <ThisIsMR_S> EG also benched some players
[0:14:05] <janit_07> doggoArrive
[0:14:06] <minded_> @1nche5 yes he does
[0:14:08] <wronweasley> @sleeeeppyyyy frenish
[0:14:08] <craigr96> If magisk goes IGL then what does apex do, roles clash with dupreeh on t side surely since theyre both entry
[0:14:09] <yobtih> zywoo's english is not good
[0:14:11] <sealer9> COUGH COUGH Liquid.... YOUR TURN
[0:14:11] <thePavix> idk about this one fl0m
[0:14:11] <KP_Codes> what change is Liquid making?
[0:14:12] <Importunity> magisk and apex might have good ideas
[0:14:12] <darthterac> THE FACES APEX MAKES LOL
[0:14:12] <drivel___> Can’t wait to watch that roster just confuse people for the first month or two.
[0:14:20] <young_buck42> yobtih your fucking english isnt very good adrenH
[0:14:23] <N11NO> apEX is perfominc right now
[0:14:25] <joker4d4> zywoo gonna be taking english classes
[0:14:26] <quuqua> Vitality worked cuz XTQZZZ knew how to talk to Apex. I dont think Zonic will send Apex home mid tournament to chill
[0:14:27] <Puddin_Wing> buuuck
[0:14:28] <fastcars888> Kreygasm
[0:14:30] <raoulduke67> no shox is a feelsbadman tho

[0:14:45] <AverageMauo> like how is misuttas english
[0:14:46] <Lucasdeath> Frenglish and Denglish is close enough LUL
[0:14:46] <hobrev> misutaa is the only unproven asset, and he wont be that for long
[0:14:46] <ThisIsMR_S> Sadge shox
[0:14:47] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m dont you think liquid should sign up some players too? like -grim -stewie? peepoSit

[0:14:52] <basedjumper> On paper, now we have to see how they do in practice.
[0:14:56] <flipflapflopflipperflaps> "no" - zywoo
[0:14:58] <thePavix> whatup fl0m
[0:14:58] <njgyaani> i mean they wouldnt have signed if they havent thought about personality clashing right ? @fl0m

[0:15:11] <pauuupauu> chat are finals bo3 or bo5
[0:15:14] <icywe1ner> kyojin drops 5 kills in the last match and vitality has the audacity to replace him @fl0m
[0:15:14] <AverageMauo> personality clashes will be prevelant i think
[0:15:16] <wronweasley> @fl0m WAIT the EG thing means Daps finally joined a team and got Stan kicked
[0:15:16] <sealer9> fl0m lets talk about possible EG and Liquid moves. Who comes to EG now?

[0:15:23] <Gabe_x> @its_gelly bruh
[0:15:24] <harrrrsh> @pauuupauu bo5
[0:15:25] <Jay_rb> The problem won't be the language imo
[0:15:28] <Tanmayl11> they will adapt.. they are professionals... Ronaldo didn't speak English when he joined United.
[0:15:28] <Jawsome159> Dupree and magisk are just working through the awpers lmao, gonna see them on navi next year

[0:15:32] <dimesntreys> tbf theres a difference between speaking another language and being confident enough to be interviewed in it where if you say teh wrong thing they'll meme you
[0:15:33] <Jazprr> Tarik to C9 Pog
[0:15:34] <YourCue> i was hesitant at first, but i think that was just shock. this lineup is STACKED
[0:15:38] <thePavix> anyone wanna play a game in bronze?
[0:15:38] <SukksGaming> Almost everyone is Europe can speak English. Thats why Europe is the greatest country of America
[0:15:38] <Kurintoi> true true. I'm hella stoked to see it!
[0:15:39] <Silkjackel222> i think apex is gonna rub zonic bad

[0:15:47] <Nightbot> MLADY
[0:15:47] <jcouls> where does shox go
[0:15:51] <Lucasdeath> even tho there's a language barrier, all the players + Zonic are hardworking individuals so they will make it work
[0:15:52] <bosshogg911> @eclipse42 ty
[0:15:52] <yo_xyzu> I know people that don't speak english but have perfect comms in game it's wild

[0:21:56] <yobtih> I don't think that EG getting a new roster is going to help NA CS, the scene isn't able to compete vs Europe so we will continue to flop

[0:22:57] <sylveonkid1> @fl0m who's leaving liquid do you think?
[0:22:58] <zanzana_> you think NA should import XTQZZ and devilwalk
[0:23:03] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[0:23:04] <dieandgopls> obo to liquid and C9 to build something with leftovers or going outside NA
[0:23:04] <sssaaarrrsss> Why are americans like that?
[0:23:05] <Gittawat_> @wronweasley  that is nice for obo
[0:23:08] <sealer9> fl0m when liquid makes changes, honest opinion who do you think leaves
[0:23:10] <mrpapajaa> Even in normal sports, the NA soccer/football team
[0:23:11] <rushil_20> @undercoverbulbasaur liquid is litterally making changes
[0:23:13] <Gatherbro> thats not counterstrike specific. Just look at the NBA or NFL
[0:23:19] <tzinga7> !pickem
[0:23:19] <zanzana_> you think NA should import XTQZZ and devilwalk ?

[0:23:30] <minded_> @fl0m what you think of ropz to replace apex and magisk IGL
[0:23:32] <1nduni> I don't really think we need NA to compete against Europe, I think we need the NA scene to actually start competing with themselves and reactivate the scene @fl0m
[0:23:35] <sealer9> when liquid makes changes, honest opinion who do you think leaves @fl0m
[0:23:36] <SEANEHKELLEH> TAWK DAT SHIT
[0:23:38] <yobtih> If the teams really cared about NA CS they would create some academy team or something.

[0:24:11] <TestTubeBaba> @yobtih NA with academy teams would flourish, with such resources
[0:24:13] <ThisIsMR_S> how apex and zonic are gonna work together
[0:24:14] <ziprisky> EU competitive streamers are boring, but they smash comps. NA players have entertaining streams, and get owned.

[0:40:48] <chromaticc_> we need shoxie to attend every major even 100 years into the future
[0:40:49] <meursaultdubois> Cadian lookin good rn
[0:40:49] <LucidR9> I WANNA KNOOOOOWW
[0:40:50] <icenut47> For zonic it is really important to be able to hype up the players
[0:40:50] <torp3d0_> @yobtih you need someone else to be down bad for Sadge
[0:40:52] <eclipse42> @LucidR9 i played blue, red, and gold like 15 years ago, not recently. if you're not trolling.
[0:40:53] <OGWerp> I could see Vitalitys coach become a GM
[0:40:53] <Puddin_Wing> I mean, it doesn't matter who your coach is. If you can have zonic, you take zonic surely

[5:09:10] <Binary_Letters> How did fl0m's whole speech about how he needs subs, to get the stream going if you like the content blah blah blah. How did that result in 0 subs? There are regulars here. $5 a month. How do you have hours of time to watch fl0m and not $5. I don't know, what are you doing with your life where you have hours of time to watch fl0m and not $5 to provide for the content you're watching. There are so... look at, I have a whole wall of non subs, this is actually really hearty that asked

[5:14:22] <mdrdGaming> GAMBIT GOT THIS FFFFF
[5:14:22] <t_aw5m> Thirty years ago, Zeus told us: "Take a trained monkey place him into the chair and he is able to play the game" Thirty years later S1mple told us: "I had to start my game like a computer It's very complicated" And Niko said, he pressed during the game the wrong button on the mouse. Question for you to all Is csgo today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the mouse are you too much under effort under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning game? Less buttons more?
