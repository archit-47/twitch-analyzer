People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retard*d but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly.

[1:28:00] <SuperTuscan888> finnish is lame tho
[1:28:02] <nuke_cs> bigfani yeah you just have to memorize which keys do the accents bc most of them dont work by default
[1:28:03] <SuperTuscan888> PauseFish

[3:25:06] <GFYMeowMix> @Speedrulez not really, but i do salt my steaks. he just said to generously salt it, and it seems overkill to put that much on a wagyu, but i've also never had it.

[3:25:56] <Speedrulez> gfymeowmix, salt you enhances the flavour, and even though wagyu has a lot of fattiness and flavour you still need a bit of salt to make it right. maybe ask 2020numbers for a bit more advive, he is the pro
