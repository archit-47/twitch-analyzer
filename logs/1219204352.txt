[1:00:14] <siiiif> You didn't ask? That's amazing, are you a dictator? A god? The most important person in the world? No? Then why would you say that like it matters?

[2:52:07] <Nightbot> because he's rollin' in dads ♿ ♿ ♿ ♿ ♿ ♿
[2:52:07] <ElPolPot> Astralis is like the Lakers over there
[2:52:11] <favemoreno> Possible team to beat navi in the next 6 months?
[2:52:14] <The_Ganznoob> fl0m GTR said he's down to play in case you donowall him NODDERS
[2:52:21] <djimpopo> the major crowd during G2 vs heroic was fucking mad. best thing ive ever participated in
[2:52:23] <SecretFlRE> astralis v navi would have been more hype for the crowd
[2:52:25] <mukulhayaran> tbh I love when someone shuts down a biased croud
[2:52:26] <NemaTad> that crowed when astralis was playing though
[2:52:33] <ekstraLUV> also them dominating nuke on the way to break the streak..no one cared
[2:52:40] <BoomingBusiness> I'm just tryna see Monesy on a real team PauseFish

[2:52:48] <rushil_20> even g2 is making changes will be interesting to see them back @fl0m
[2:52:48] <maybeDuck> I was so happy when astralis lost LuL
[2:52:51] <SovietChill> its gotta be cloud9 to beat NaVi COPIUM
[2:52:51] <Raithorn> @i_AWP fl0m chat heals all <3 (my doctor disagrees but eh)
[2:52:52] <reign217> i think the current astralis lineup has a pretty good chance if they play a little longer
[2:52:54] <FinestAce2> M4?
[2:52:55] <The_Ganznoob> DinkDonk
[2:52:57] <ManLikeDanger> !cast
[2:52:59] <ZPNK> The energy was there when astralis and heroic played
[2:53:00] <AIR02000> i feel like it could be g2 tho, if the monesy thing works out that is
[2:53:00] <ManLikeDanger> !friends
[2:53:07] <wreck_it_reek> is need ES to become the best NA team
[2:53:08] <SukksGaming> I really liked the bit where the caster said "We already got your money so fuck you guys"
[2:53:13] <ekstraLUV> it was a great crowd when astralis were "winning", not playing
[2:53:24] <NemaTad> astralis only had 11 days of practice togeter before blast...come on
[2:53:27] <The_Ganznoob> KEKWiggle

[3:43:11] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> pepeMeltdown WHATS HAPPENING
[3:43:11] <wreck_it_reek> the quality of video games coming out is horrible now, every game that's released is incomplete, buggy, glitchy. they are all still in beta it feels like
[3:43:13] <dev1ce_56> @fl0m ur not balding then why are you malding?
[3:43:13] <byejuly> @cassieblacc maybe its an identity thing
[3:43:15] <billballbowl> I remember when games would get released and be 1-2 expansions and it would be fun for 5 years. Now people find themselves pouring 100's of dollars into games they enjoy
[3:43:15] <LowRatedHighlander> hell yeah
[3:43:17] <autumn9_> gg
[3:43:26] <SupraUK_> so do you think valheim will overtake minecraft fl0m Keepo
[3:43:29] <greenteasake> People can't ignore the fact that Valorant's most successful player failed at CSGO miserably :D (TenZ, C9)
[3:43:30] <beya209> Thats very true. I noticed I havent had much fun playing CS so Im taking a fat break until I miss it again lol dont want to play and have a miserable time then rub that off onto other people
[3:43:35] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> hey @LowRatedHighlander i need some help, my balls are itchy peepoSit

[3:43:42] <cassieblacc> @byejuly yeah i mean that makes sense. kids want to feel like they belong to something
[3:43:46] <ikeledee> back before patches could release games had to come out complete and polished or else they would fail

[3:55:29] <BinaryHorizon> Pog over 50 let’s go
[3:55:30] <cronican> flom is the black shirt of the family
[3:55:35] <ImTarco> I have zero interest in gambling.
[3:55:44] <justdanny> have you told your parents that scared channel points dont make channel points
[3:55:46] <ImTarco> It is actively unfun to me.

[3:56:00] <PeskyPhoenix> You're telling me teachers are boring?
[3:56:01] <cassieblacc> @ImTarco poker with friends is fun
[3:56:01] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> i only gamba channel points and 5 dollars on fl0ms matches

[3:56:20] <STatisfacti0n> fl0m had like 3 headsets left over, he just chose not to switch
[3:56:23] <6en0> gambling with channel points has taught me never to gamble with real money KEKW

[3:56:31] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> fl0m wont even share his old headsets
[3:56:37] <ImTarco> @cassieblacc Yeah true, but if you're just playing with neutral chips, it's just kinda playing cards. LUL No actual money on the line.

[5:08:12] <greenteasake> Default 20 or 25 percent? I would get stiffed left and right, 20 or 25 is a pretty penny to drivers :P
[5:08:14] <budgetwaifu> i always feel weird tipping drivers because they get a fee for driving already, but usually 15 always because its normal
[5:08:28] <BoomingBusiness> nt
[5:08:32] <lilbock9> I tip 1$ bc im broke boy
[5:08:33] <daddycloudcakes> damn that was cheezy
[5:08:35] <budgetwaifu> but also americans get paid so little
[5:08:36] <KendracoTV> nt

[5:08:50] <Inxter> Chat, which one of you gambled on the wrong choice with my points ? Rude fl0mB
[5:08:50] <MisonS2> the fee they get, at least in the US is very small unless drivers keep passing on the order @budgetwaifu
[5:09:04] <luiGi_rl> @budgetwaifu not all drivers get fees, working at papa johns i got nothing from the fees, store keeps them
[5:09:09] <budgetwaifu> yeah where i live we have a fee where the driver gets the fee already
[5:09:18] <formerlygood> drivers do get paid by the companies, it's not JUST tips
[5:09:29] <insert_dankmeme> where's stans or obo going to ?
[5:09:30] <formerlygood> but tips make or break it
[5:09:31] <supra_nightmare> i feel like the only person in the world who doesnt eat fast food, doesnt order delivery food.
[5:09:39] <Kurintoi> That's why i can't afford that shit so many fees a burrito is $22 before tipping driver
[5:09:41] <greenteasake> @budgetwaifu Fees are not as much as you think they are, to be viable, drivers do need tips
[5:09:44] <budgetwaifu> but also american service workers make fucking nothing
[5:09:44] <sylveonkid1> yea americans get paid like crap my 30 dollars a hour ain't enough to li e on
[5:09:45] <beerocl0ck> yall saying they shouldnt get tipped should go work a day in those jobs and then tell me you have the same opinion
[5:09:58] <budgetwaifu> my friend was telling me she made 2.40 an hour and i was like what the fuck
[5:10:08] <greazywook> Last two days chat we’ve got to watch fl0m eat, we are the real winners here. Welcome home BB, we all missed you fl0mPog

[5:10:16] <BoomingBusiness> I order occasionally but mainly don't like fast food. Easy to make better stuff myself @supra_nightmare
[5:10:38] <dev1ce_56> @flom u like church's chicken?
[5:10:41] <budgetwaifu> yeah that shit blows my mind
[5:10:42] <MisonS2> yea servers and waiters/waitresses get so little when it comes to actual pay from where they work most times, the tips make it a lot better
[5:10:45] <TheRenegadeRonin> @beerocl0ck the company should pay more to the driver so they don't have to live on the capricious whims of people like twitch chat
[5:10:53] <LowRatedHighlander> KKona
[5:10:56] <formerlygood> @budgetwaifu make nothing? Bartenders and waitresses make great money. Not all of them, but plenty of them do.
[5:11:01] <TheRenegadeRonin> @beerocl0ck doesnt me an you shouldnt tip tho
[5:11:04] <supra_nightmare> @BoomingBusiness yea, we make food at home from scatch for everything or go out to a steak house
[5:11:09] <beerocl0ck> TheRenegadeRonin you are not wrong one bit
[5:11:14] <budgetwaifu> @formerlygood but rely on the tips usually
[5:11:14] <MisonS2> she's talking about actual pay from her work, not from tips @formerlygood
[5:11:17] <DropkickGsus> the relying on tipping to get enough wage is just mindboggling to me, over here waiters and delivery guys are just paid a normal wage
[5:11:18] <budgetwaifu> yes
[5:11:20] <formerlygood> @budgetwaifu yeah
[5:11:21] <sylveonkid1> waitresses at Hooters make great money
[5:11:29] <BoomingBusiness> was that a flying no scope or was it the other guy
[5:11:32] <formerlygood> @fl0m should the average player keep M4-S over AK? Or is it preference?
[5:11:33] <budgetwaifu> to me its just crazy you have to rely on tips to live
[5:11:37] <budgetwaifu> murica
[5:11:48] <LowRatedHighlander> KKona
[5:11:49] <Krabby12> wait so u do a job to make money but if u dont make enough money u owe them money????
[5:11:50] <Kurintoi> merica fuck yea
[5:11:51] <BoomingBusiness> yea agreed maple
[5:11:53] <dweevers> budgetwaifu NODDERS it's not as bad up here but it is similar sadly
[5:11:53] <MisonS2> sadly that's Capitalism
[5:11:55] <Hearte_> Pay your workers america wtf
[5:12:02] <LowRatedHighlander> alright careful chat
[5:12:03] <RopeSnap> NA
[5:12:04] <wreck_it_reek> Washington state, servers make minimum wage +tips
[5:12:09] <LowRatedHighlander> we getting close to that line

[5:12:10] <Raithorn> @budgetwaifu the minimum wage for tipped workers is still 2.13 which is big wack
[5:12:14] <luiGi_rl> @Krabby12 if the customers decide you dont deserve money, you dont make money
[5:12:16] <long_hands_02> yeah we don't have that here the waiters have their salary or paid by the hour
[5:12:18] <insert_dankmeme> @fl0m in asia, we don't tip at all lol
[5:12:19] <budgetwaifu> @dweevers i mean server min is still like 13 in most places in canada
[5:12:29] <Miksu2222> working in the service industry in the us seems like such inconsistant income
[5:12:33] <supra_nightmare> @dweevers Mr.D!! MLADY how are you good sir?
[5:12:34] <matienelmondo> LUL
[5:12:35] <dweevers> budgetwaifu true, but that still isn't a living wage most places
[5:12:38] <1PissedOffAmerican> so many people fuck over servers so bad
[5:12:39] <budgetwaifu> no its not
[5:12:40] <sylveonkid1> I would rather just pay servers a normal wage and get rid of tips
[5:12:42] <greenteasake> In Texas, minimum wage is 7.25, but if you work as a waiter, or even a delivery driver, you can make as low as ~$4.00 an hour

[5:12:54] <byejuly> nooo you lost a round? to be honest some clearvoyant feeling came into me when i felt the 16-0
[5:13:02] <MisonS2> a lot of the restaurants here in the US have a starting wage for waiters/waitresses and if they make X amount in tips, then their work cuts their pay by quite a bit

[5:14:43] <MagicMarker1> @beerocl0ck Who tips on a pickup order? What service did they provide lool
[5:14:45] <Raithorn> @5Rule_ 15% maybe?
[5:14:48] <Kurintoi> aww thank you fl0mCozy
[5:14:49] <NewellOK> i have friends that make a dollar less than minimum wage because some companies get to pay students less
[5:14:52] <mcdoopily> @Miseryhd i get a tax return 2.5k+
[5:14:52] <nlawley1> avalon?
[5:14:53] <greenteasake> I tip even if I order from a drive thru, purely out of appreciation for having an idea of how much food service workers bust their butts
[5:14:57] <wreck_it_reek> i'll never forget serving a table of 6 then being told "I wont give you more than i donate to the church" then was tipped $2.67 on a $80 bill
[5:14:59] <budgetwaifu> @nlawley1 im in town
[5:14:59] <beerocl0ck> MagicMarker1 they still gotta bag/box up your shit
[5:15:02] <byejuly> tbh im so happy i dont live i a country where you are forced to tip - maybe im cheap but thats how i feel
[5:15:03] <STatisfacti0n> WeirdEyes @fl0m why would you say such terrible things?
[5:15:03] <humdrum9> BatChest
[5:15:04] <supra_nightmare> At my company we have an analyst that researches average cost of living in employee's cities, we add between 5 to 10% on top of that and thats what i pay my employees
[5:15:11] <MagicMarker1> @beerocl0ck Yeah and thats there job
[5:15:11] <jokkerbo> @beerocl0ck pre-covid no or rarely.   Post covid yes bc they are struggling and public facing so that I dont have to
[5:15:13] <Benb727> its a tough scenario i mostly agree, but also the whole thing that some servers payments are mostly tips, like thats a fault of the system itself, which should be changed imo @fl0m tips shouldnt have to make up most your wage imo
[5:15:18] <Uwotm08> Tipping culture is toxic.
[5:15:24] <nlawley1> thats crazy, small world
[5:15:31] <Solank0> Tips are meant to be a bonus on top of wages for a good job and good meal. American tipping is weird when it is expected
[5:15:32] <supra_nightmare> @dweevers thats all im trying to do, finish at the normal time i wrap up so i can actually sleep
[5:15:32] <matienelmondo> 16 - 1
[5:15:34] <Benb727> yeah when you know, you should not do it, ofc
[5:15:36] <budgetwaifu> never thought id meet someone from here in chat
[5:15:38] <beerocl0ck> @MagicMarker1 you could say the same thing about dine in experience? thats their job?
[5:15:40] <budgetwaifu> thats awesome!
[5:15:45] <dweevers> NODDERS supra_nightmare peepoHuggers

[5:15:54] <yuxi100> Mr 139 calling us poor Sadge
[5:15:55] <STatisfacti0n> PAY THE WAITER IN CASH
[5:15:56] <Benb727> when youre aware, im not disagreeing with your point, just saying its a bigger issue as well
[5:15:58] <STatisfacti0n> THEN RUN OUT
[5:16:00] <izdabest9> Tipping to me really depends on how the waiter treats the group, if its average I just double tax which is like 15% anyways
[5:16:00] <supra_nightmare> @dweevers peepoHuggers
[5:16:01] <5Rule_> @Raithorn ayo dude 15% thats alot sadgeBusinessTime
[5:16:08] <chaoskompanie> @supra_nightmare @fl0m why make it so difficult, that the restaurant pays a living wage - and raise the price a little. So you only tip when the service was okay and you cant stiff the waiter
[5:16:14] <bendoverson99> what do waiters do when tourists dont tip?
[5:16:15] <NewellOK> Dine and dash but also tip 5Head

[5:16:18] <MagicMarker1> @beerocl0ck and based on how well the service is there your tip
[5:16:20] <DropkickGsus> just dont be a waiter 5head
[5:16:20] <Hearte_> The only person who suffers from you refusing to tip, is the person who actually needs the tip to live.
[5:16:20] <FegelBite> no excuses. always tip
[5:16:21] <flash3r751> @fl0m tipping is weird in ireland like when i got a massive tattoo i tried tipping the tattoo artist and he said no i cant take that and wouldnt let me
[5:16:23] <greenteasake> I've given waiters or waitresses 0 in tip but only if their service is atrocious, an example was we had to order from another waiter all night long because our's showed up maybe twice, instead we tipped the waiter that helped us out
[5:16:30] <Benb727> nah nah, i agree, just saying its also a bigger issue @fl0m
[5:16:36] <budgetwaifu> all i heard was going to fuck somebody

[5:17:12] <Xargling> fl0m what gets me are places that are starting to put a tip screen on checkout, like fast food. Like ya I go out and I tip, unless I am at a place where gratuity is already included in the check, but fast food I am not tipping.
[5:17:13] <praeter15> budgetwaifu weird
[5:17:14] <beerocl0ck> MagicMarker1 and i'd say that getting your stuff packaged up is still a form of service. also it takes away from their time at a table, its not like they get paid more if they're bagging togo orders

[5:17:54] <praeter15> You didn't ask? That's amazing, are you a dictator? A god? The most important person in the world? No? Then why would you say that like it matters? "Did I ask?" no, you did not ask. Do you think your opinion holds a higher meaning than anyone else's? You could've said anything, something creative, even an ok or you not saying a word would be better than the phrase "Did I ask?" we get it, you never asked, but did anyone ask about you asking?
[5:17:58] <insert_dankmeme> maybe the tipping fee already included in the service charge ??

[6:38:37] <rushil_20> china is also invested a lot because of skins they love cs skin trading @fl0m
[6:38:37] <zainzainzainnn> much more asians into valorant i think, speaking from experience from a SEA player
[6:38:45] <muddychor> riot better than valve
[6:38:46] <akasor02> time to do comp sci hw i will be lurking

[6:39:14] <duhmize> yo fl0m would you be able to explain how franchising will give players a rude awakening?
[6:39:24] <KodaRG> @muddychor yeah and that something is so far gone OMEGALUL
[6:39:26] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> monkaGIGA the valorant andies are coming out
[6:39:28] <LowRatedHighlander> its not always about money
[6:39:33] <Kafkii> Ah yes the prize money only 4 teams can participate in for franchising
[6:39:40] <Kafkii> VERY GOOD SCENE
[6:39:42] <KodaRG> Kafkii MLADY
[6:39:44] <agarlicbear> its about the mets baby go mets
[6:39:47] <Kafkii> theBaboda MLADY
[6:39:49] <sebica_99> Fl0m do you connect your headphones through bluetooth on pc?
[6:39:51] <LowRatedHighlander> youre just like the guy trying to tell me that zywoo is going to spirit because they could pay him more
[6:39:53] <prius_tv> Look at Call of duty.  Franchising basically ruined the comp scene
[6:39:58] <Kafkii> Its about the mets spider-man
[6:40:00] <Kafkii> It's all about the mets
[6:40:01] <KodaRG> agarlicbear KEKW
[6:40:06] <rushil_20> didnt we also have cs events in china before covid @fl0m I remember crowd going nuts for dev1ce
[6:40:06] <KodaRG> THE METS BABY LETSGO
[6:40:10] <duhmize> makes sense! thanks for explaining @fl0m
[6:40:11] <agarlicbear> hit a home run baby
[6:40:16] <humdrum9> PepeLaugh bait?
[6:40:19] <muddychor> @LowRatedHighlander not always but always
[6:40:26] <LowRatedHighlander> its important
[6:40:30] <KodaRG> @muddychor wtf does that mean KEKW
[6:40:32] <LowRatedHighlander> but its not the only factor KEKW
[6:40:39] <Kafkii> Not always but always NODDERS
[6:40:40] <KodaRG> "not always but always"
[6:40:43] <insert_dankmeme> look at overwatch LUL LUL LUL
[6:40:43] <muddychor> @theBaboda poetic license
[6:40:45] <LowRatedHighlander> and pretending it is is just ignorant
[6:40:50] <Kafkii> OWL KEKW
[6:40:56] <wh1te_angel> fax
[6:40:58] <Kafkii> Imagine paying players that much for them to not do shit
[6:41:01] <Killer_Panda2k11> That's ignorant, you're ignorant KEKW
[6:41:02] <KodaRG> OWL is so fucked LMAO
[6:41:03] <Hearte_> Literally look at league. Instead of new players being brought to NA, its all EU and Korean players

[6:41:21] <rushil_20> didnt we also have cs events in china before covid @fl0m I remember crowd going nuts for dev1ce
[6:41:21] <KodaRG> Kafkii I do like watching me some OWL tho ngl
[6:41:33] <Kafkii> theBaboda I dont recognize any NA players in OWL now
[6:41:34] <potassium_possum> the biggest prospects are typically just solo queue players which kinda sucks
[6:41:34] <Hearte_> TSM spending $6m on a player and not even making playoffs
[6:41:40] <KodaRG> Kafkii I just watch supertf Peepo
[6:41:41] <Kafkii> nor do I recognize the koreans/chinese
[6:41:41] <dweevers> fl0m just look at the difference between LEC and LCS. The LEC at least has the ERL to feed players in to LEC like the tier 2 scene in CS
[6:41:51] <Kafkii> Also Shanghai dragons are literally all koreans now aren't they?
[6:41:56] <KodaRG> Kafkii Yes KEKW
[6:41:57] <DIkktudo> eu>na
[6:41:58] <itsPoZr> @fl0m how do you feel about CS academy teams? Do you think it’s a good way for teams to get great young talent for there team?
[6:42:01] <St3amroller> I HECKIN LOVE TENZ BatChest
[6:42:03] <Killer_Panda2k11> Isn't franchising just a safe way for orgs to make money? kinda like American sports where there's no relegation?
[6:42:04] <SebuOG> @fl0m basically shroud etc came from tier2 etc scene
[6:42:08] <Kafkii> Thats so sad
[6:42:11] <a732v> The NA scene actually benefitted from the OWL...it just took some time and then OWL failed KEKW
[6:42:12] <HerrRhodes> Developer sponsored tournaments are def the way to go instead of whole ass franchised leagues
[6:42:12] <sebica_99> Fl0m do you connect your headphones through bluetooth on pc
[6:42:16] <insert_dankmeme> @fl0m na suck at everythihing
[6:42:24] <Kafkii> NA are good at FGC NODDERS

[6:42:25] <okie42> Thanks to all the Gamblers
[6:42:28] <cmxc0> Killer_Panda2k11 im pretty sure esport orgs dont really make money
[6:42:30] <tattt000> was it due to the matchfixing not directly but is that why mountain dew pulled out @fl0m
[6:42:33] <HerrRhodes> insert_dankmeme paapoWeird
[6:42:34] <Kafkii> Except when it comes to fighting japan
[6:42:39] <rrumack> @fl0m  what is the Benefit for franchising? b/c it does not sound good

[6:42:41] <The_Wombatman> You should talk to imls about the Franchising and NA talent issue, you would both get along lol
[6:42:42] <pushinzz> CS focuses too much on regions, and not enough on Individuals
[6:42:52] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> 2.4ghz is completely different from BT @fl0m Actually
[6:42:54] <KodaRG> fl0m is based as fuck NODDERS
[6:42:56] <Kafkii> rrumack more money for the scene but thats basically it
[6:42:57] <KodaRG> we love fl0m
[6:42:59] <KodaRG> NODDERS
[6:43:00] <techa17> NA is generally pretty good at rocket league tho
[6:43:01] <DesiXD> Cloud9 for example
[6:43:06] <Zorik13> cant wait for franchising. there would be so many orgs that would get cuckblocked out of circuit
[6:43:07] <Kafkii> NA rocket league is CRACKED
[6:43:11] <w0rmk1ll3r> is wookie still banned? KEKPOINT

[6:43:17] <natas_k> we dont grow talent like say Navi or Gambit. FeelsBadMan
[6:43:17] <KodaRG> NA is decent at Rocket league but tbf rocket league is mainly massive in NA KEKW
[6:43:20] <akasor02> it allows players to shine when qualifying for tournies
[6:43:22] <rushil_20> didnt we also have cs events in china before covid @fl0m I remember crowd going nuts for dev1ce

[6:43:31] <DIkktudo> do you thing its culture problem?
[6:43:33] <SebuOG> @fl0m i mean did not shroud come from the low tier and was noticed, so franchise ruins it for others and stuff
[6:43:35] <Kafkii> muddychor Canada is literally NA....
[6:43:41] <KodaRG> @muddychor please google North America
[6:43:43] <waferthinmint> They really should model their comp scene after the shining example of tribes ascend 2 OR quake champions :p

[6:45:21] <Kafkii> NO WAY
[6:45:29] <SoporificPanda> i heard that the guy who found shroud was pretty smart with the game but not very skilled. got cut for NAF i think

[7:55:08] <Hearte_> @byejuly He said earlier, as an awper he normally goes for body shots, not headshots, so the A1s works better than the AK for him
[7:55:08] <MisonS2> it absolutely was @LucidR9
[7:55:08] <GFYMeowMix> amazing what they look like w/o maguire KEKW
[7:55:09] <LucidR9> shocking how that happens when maguire isnt playing
[7:55:14] <LucidR9> he's so bad
[7:55:14] <seven1tf2> YeeYee
[7:55:16] <MisonS2> KEKW
[7:55:18] <LucidR9> I've said it for so long
[7:55:22] <LucidR9> he thinks he's playing CAM
[7:55:25] <MisonS2> but but but... he plays for the national team KEKW @LucidR9
[7:55:27] <seven1tf2> seven1tf2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! YeeYeeYee

[7:55:32] <yourducky> if only you had a new phone fl0m peepoGiggles
[7:55:35] <byejuly> @Hearte_ guess that makes sense - thx bud
[7:55:35] <GFYMeowMix> i was telling somebody else IRL how lindelof and bailly are actually solid CBs but can't stay healthy or just end up looking bad
[7:55:50] <sebica_99> hi fl0m
[7:55:51] <LucidR9> victor and bailly play for the badge more than maguire ever did
[7:55:52] <GFYMeowMix> now we know why they look bad
[7:55:57] <LucidR9> also I have no idea why he's our captain
[7:56:00] <GFYMeowMix> slabhead
[7:56:00] <LucidR9> he doesn't motivate
[7:56:03] <GFYMeowMix> LOL
[7:56:08] <yourducky> inb4 stolen in shipping fl0m PepeLaugh
[7:56:08] <GFYMeowMix> cause he was $$$$ englishman
[7:56:12] <LucidR9> no like I dont mean that as in he doesnt play motivationally
[7:56:13] <sebica_99> utd in the bin
[7:56:18] <GFYMeowMix> stupid to do that right away though
[7:56:23] <LucidR9> like it's reported he doesnt do stuff to motivate the team when they're down
[7:56:24] <MisonS2> because reasons that they don't even know @LucidR9
[7:56:32] <LucidR9> bruno is a good captain
[7:56:33] <GFYMeowMix> ya he's no leader
[7:56:45] <LucidR9> bruno will work for that badge
[7:56:48] <LucidR9> that's what united need rn
[7:56:51] <LucidR9> players who want to play for the badge
[7:56:53] <GFYMeowMix> i would keep it with de gea, maybe bruno or mctominay if he's on

[7:58:10] <LucidR9> bro matic with flick passes and backpasses is so funny
[7:58:14] <LucidR9> that man has some tekkers
[7:58:15] <GFYMeowMix> mctominay has shown that he can be good
[7:58:30] <GFYMeowMix> matic can still do something lol
[7:58:34] <MisonS2> i just don't think mctominay is consistently good @GFYMeowMix
[7:58:37] <LucidR9> he cant really play 90 mins
[7:58:49] <sebica_99> mctominay fouls the whole time, i don t see that much quality in him apart from the physical ones
[7:58:49] <officer_ant> Team griffing
[7:58:59] <GFYMeowMix> @MisonS2 he had a solid run last season, but i think he's been rotated a lot this year and that's hurt him
[7:59:05] <GFYMeowMix> but i also don't follow them enough to know if that's true

[8:18:11] <a732v> Do the big streamers have midrolls in their contracts?

[8:32:23] <AstersCreed> no gamba
[8:32:28] <LowRatedHighlander> and theBaboda was suggesting a dnd too but that might be a lil harder
[8:32:33] <brushie_brushie> MOTHERGOOSE
[8:32:46] <Hearte_> Oo if its custom games I might actually be able to play and not get cucked by ping
[8:32:49] <LowRatedHighlander> yaya i think it would be fun to do like twice a month
[8:32:54] <michaisn> flom are player models symetrical in valorant compared to cs?
[8:33:03] <Floofys> I wish I could join for Halo but it doesn't work for me
[8:33:05] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah thats what i was saying with dnd. its very time zone dependent and stuff
[8:33:19] <Floofys> For DnD though has anyone played Divinity Original Sin 2?
[8:33:21] <brushie_brushie> I just see in triangles
[8:33:24] <michaisn> like in CS when you peek, they can't see your head from the left
[8:33:31] <michaisn> in window
[8:33:35] <LowRatedHighlander> divinity is a good substitute for sure Floofys

[8:34:28] <KodaRG> not diablo specifically but a game like that
[8:34:29] <LowRatedHighlander> i can do it hold on
[8:34:31] <KodaRG> if that makes sense
[8:34:31] <GFYMeowMix> also, i would hop in on some halo infinite games when those get setup WICKED
[8:34:40] <LowRatedHighlander> gamba up quick
[8:34:42] <LowRatedHighlander> gogogogogo
