[1:52:49] <Zorik13> @bluehipp0 he was holding top con for 30 seconds previus round. he didnt clear anything in mid. fl0m is not talking about under. nobody clears under

[1:54:07] <maxbax0808> griefing monkaW
[1:54:09] <c0rkmcnortis> I don't know why you would suggest that someone is using 3rd party software to get an advantage. It is clearly against the rules to do that, and Valve AntiCheat prevents you from using such software on their VAC secured servers
[1:54:10] <MrFortyOz> did he just TK
[1:54:10] <bluehipp0> I sometimes play like that, no joke!
[1:54:10] <nmars_> griefing
[1:54:13] <NextDoorGuy> @Zorik13 yea ok but this is a MG1 lobby with a global in it, surely the level should be higher than this

[1:54:13] <little_manga_reader> @FlameyKumori fl0mH
[1:54:16] <IcyFraggin> You dont just rush mid to con once a game?

[1:54:21] <Mr_Motumbo> I just report and let VAC sort it out
[1:54:21] <ScholarSignus> TK'd time to get a 40 day for griefing KEKW
[1:54:23] <hobrev> these are the types of players that used to make overwatch videos worth watching
[1:54:26] <whitechocolate64> Yeah this guy would 100% get  through overwatch
[1:54:26] <FlameyKumori> Look he's cheating, but as long as he's not grieing it's fine.

[1:54:50] <Demonara> KEKW
[1:54:51] <visiblescout> on the way to CON where he wasn't looking at window did anyone break murder hole to jungle?
[1:54:52] <Zorik13> @bluehipp0 cs aim is all about positioning. its not pure aim. you cant be silver with good aim in mg lobby. that is not possible

[1:55:16] <its_gelly> @speedrulez hi potato man!
[1:55:17] <Joe_Slaughter> PREVIOUS ROUND
[1:55:20] <MrFortyOz> he was tracking his team mate through a wall
[1:55:20] <DullaTPG> it seems like the whole game he just played by himself without even trying to take a place in the map with a teammate aswell
[1:55:20] <Lia_de> "i hate this game. I am miserable. someone help me"
[1:55:25] <ThePooP> the shit he types in chat makes is more obvious
[1:55:25] <whitechocolate64> new players dont 1TAP the fuck outta people though KEKW
[1:55:26] <MiraiShikimi> duno, other then the random prefire mid it seams normal when you look at the positions of his teamates
[1:55:28] <c0smosLIVE> ...
[1:55:28] <hobrev> he tracked his teammate thru a wall
[1:55:28] <Demonara> KEKPOINT "bh i hate this game" KEKPOINT
[1:55:28] <bluehipp0> @Zorik13 I guess I'm playing against 10 times more cheaters then than I realized KEKW
[1:55:33] <am_not_weeb> what were the ranks in this game
[1:55:34] <crocswsocks> are these dono's bait?
[1:55:36] <freeman986> @fl0m Look at the ingame chat
[1:55:36] <c0smosLIVE> this piss me off even more than the cheater
[1:55:37] <bluehipp0> @Zorik13 no wonder I lose 87% of games
[1:55:39] <pinkassassin> yea but most GNs/Silvers wouldnt know a cheater unless he was spinning
[1:55:40] <MrFortyOz> round 14
[1:55:40] <rileey01> Join joined, what’s happening here chat
[1:55:43] <toggIed_> that's not normally
[1:55:43] <Speedrulez> wait there are people who think he is not cheating?

[1:55:46] <its_gelly> !1deag
[1:55:47] <Nightbot> its_gelly pops a 1deag on bursttttttt 1TAP
[1:55:50] <Sirius_0069> @am_not_weeb gn and mg
[1:55:54] <crocswsocks> n0r13k is that bait or
[1:55:54] <koolaidonsteam> What about the round where he tracked fl0m through the wall from window to connector lmfao
[1:55:56] <n0r13k> the way he doesn't clear anything is standard, 30% of my kills in GN were from CT-side sandbags on top of Vertigo A ramp.
[1:55:56] <nanikus0> the BIGGEST THING is that this is indeed what new players do but this is a fucking MG1/global lobby is it not? so if it is then why is he not doing the little things that most people this high for mm do?
[1:55:57] <MattieKetchup> i could believe silvers playing and not checking like this
[1:56:01] <Belegdhor> I showed up late is there a round that made you suspicious?
[1:56:08] <Saint_Helix> Let's just watch your team mate and get out.

[1:56:23] <skamos_> stream sniping maybe?
[1:56:24] <Speedrulez> SepiDrunk KEKWiggle i keep doing it KEKWiggle

[1:56:31] <Zorik13> @bluehipp0 i dont think so. you realy need to listen what fl0m is trying to explain to you. he clearly knows what is he talking about
[1:56:31] <Papa_Reesty> KEKWiggle
[1:56:32] <davheed> im convinced, just wanted to point out he also seems bad on top of the hacks
[1:56:32] <sylveonkid1> ban! @n0r13k
[1:56:32] <bluehipp0> I'm still conflicted, because it just reminds me how I play

[1:56:37] <Nomad182> monkaGIGA
[1:56:37] <TEC_REBEL> WTFF
[1:56:38] <cmxc0> if theres only one sus clip i dont convict usually
[1:56:42] <cmxc0> unless its MEGA sus
[1:56:49] <bosketball> Play game stream man
[1:56:52] <Demonara> @Belegdhor not 100% but it was just small stuff and the more he played the more "obvious" it became for him tho
[1:56:55] <ekstral0ve> which is why incentives for reporting cheaters either through overwatch or demo review is a must need i think
[1:56:55] <abhi007bond> %? chat actually thinks he legit peepoGiggles
[1:56:56] <Nightbot> Joris says 78%
[1:57:00] <WookiePotamus> it might have been a demo bug but it was pretty funny live KEKW
[1:57:00] <sjoerdtheman> watch the kush guy after 8-11
[1:57:00] <NextDoorGuy> this is the round with the usp prefire
[1:57:01] <nmars_> KEKW
[1:57:03] <silver_smurfer_47> If he is really cheating , he is pretty good at it. I don't think he can be reported based on htis
[1:57:05] <abhi007bond> monkaW
[1:57:08] <Steve_Rockie> KEKW
[1:57:10] <russiehugg> KEKW
[1:57:12] <guyritchie27> KEKW
[1:57:13] <Callirrho_> There’s a cheat program that they have a percentage of shots they fire til it’s accurate. And they can turn walls on and off. Or they can just have the radar on. I’ve played like 800 hours on na servers. There’s a lot of cheaters.
[1:57:13] <Uwotm08> @cmxc0 Same. You never know for sure if it wasn't a 32-tick demo artefact.
[1:57:18] <little_manga_reader> KEKW
[1:57:21] <Mr_Motumbo> He did TK
[1:57:21] <isness> %? will he make a fifth account
[1:57:22] <Nightbot> Joris says 73%
[1:57:22] <bolottekid> KEKW
[1:57:22] <dims_cs> here's a spicy question, do you think there's pros cheating in one of the top30 teams? @fl0m
[1:57:22] <ptr_was_framed_> OMEGALUL

[1:57:35] <cmxc0> Uwotm08 yeah when you watch your own demos back theres some sus shit too because of it
[1:57:37] <bluehipp0> @Zorik13 I think the difference between him and what I do is: he just gets "too lucky" "too often", I guess
[1:57:38] <Uwotm08> Yeah that's pretty damn sus.
[1:57:39] <spli7er> KEKW
[1:57:44] <90tino> KEKW
[1:57:46] <bosketball> trigger
[1:57:49] <prestkenth> didnt you have a scoute when he did that
[1:58:01] <billballbowl> Did you report him? I understand that Valve typically takes quick and decisive action to deal with these matters
[1:58:03] <isness> there he is
[1:58:04] <jdubscs> Did u already get a cheater in mm?

[1:58:26] <Kafkii> what the fuck did Ijust type
[1:58:27] <AFugy> he stopped cheating after you complimented his game play
[1:58:28] <LowRatedHighlander> Well that’s 5
[1:58:29] <Kafkii> Speedrulez peepoHug
[1:58:29] <Nomad182> MmmHmm

[1:58:38] <CheezerSalad> bro i started playing csgo for the first time ever yesterday and holy shit it's actually 10 times better than valorant. The only bad thing is cheaters and well i have to buy prime to play rank so yea that kinda sucks. But i can't believe i used to trash talk this game
[1:58:39] <Speedrulez> peepoGiggles
[1:58:40] <Zorik13> @bluehipp0 no way you are serius right now
[1:58:44] <cmxc0> hes just standing there waiting to see if he appears on this side again
[1:58:45] <jdubscs> its either low ranks or cheaters
[1:58:48] <isness> %? will he make a sixth account?
[1:58:48] <Nightbot> Joris says 28%
[1:58:48] <thesmallmacaroni> Some does
[1:58:51] <Nomad182> @CheezerSalad welcome OneOfUs
[1:58:51] <sylveonkid1> fl0m knows who cheats remember when fl0m cheated with namelock
[1:58:52] <spli7er> i dont cheat so i woulnt know
[1:58:53] <ptr_was_framed_> what was his rank btw?
[1:58:55] <Steve_Rockie> I believe you can't see another person ouside of a radius
[1:58:55] <DullaTPG> im convinced the stranger with 5 accounts is anthrax
[1:58:55] <nmars_> I'm not a cheater, but works the same as walls fl0m
[1:58:57] <nmars_> :)
[1:58:57] <RueTheArc> I think radar has the same limitation; the server just stops reporting location when they're far enough away
[1:58:57] <abhi007bond> anybody knows modCheck
[1:58:58] <jdubscs> finding a legit LE or Supreme is so rare
[1:58:59] <JonesMusic> radar hack doesn't work very well anymore but some cheats can do it in mm
[1:59:01] <WookiePotamus> @Speedrulez i suck at banning people ok im way to slow
[1:59:02] <dims_cs> @CheezerSalad dont play matchmaking, go to faceit, its free and no cheaters
[1:59:02] <IBeGinger> @CheezerSalad Faceit mm is 10x better
[1:59:05] <Zorik13> @fl0m radar should not work across the map. game unloads models when you cant see them
[1:59:06] <little_manga_reader> omg i thought the demo was paused he was so still

[3:42:28] <GFYMeowMix> @trex2334 ya it'll be interesting for sure due to line ups. you got the whole lukaku up top vs VVD who isn't 100% (at least hasn't looked it to me). robbo i think will be back and will probably start instead of tsimikas. who knows if hendo and/or thiago start. but tuchel has got chelsea purring and defensively sound.

[4:10:26] <binaibordello> wie is @fl0m sometimes looking right at the floor after he misses his shot?
[4:10:44] <Zacolian> skill
[4:10:44] <Speedrulez> binaibordello cuz he sad Sadge Clap
[4:10:45] <LowRatedHighlander> @binaibordello hides your head so you take less damage
[4:10:54] <DullaTPG> binaibordello his aimbot
[4:10:55] <bluehipp0> @binaibordello to make his hitbox smaller, so that he doesn't get hit as easily
[4:10:56] <ShrapTy> binaibordello cheats sputter out for short periods of time
[4:10:58] <DullaTPG> it glitches it out a bit
[4:11:00] <AIR02000> that smoke he did, he runs up until the manhole right?
[4:11:09] <Zacolian> yes
[4:11:24] <LowRatedHighlander> Your player model will duck it’s head forward so you look down and turn away and it’s hard to get headshots so less damage
[4:11:31] <ShrapTy> binaibordello really though its much harder to hit a player when they look down
[4:11:41] <AIR02000> @Zacolian ah kk
[4:11:47] <Speedrulez> binaibordello the real answer is indeed decreasing his hitbox. that is why you also sometimes see him move in backwards. hitting a headshot that way is real hard
[4:12:01] <ShrapTy> ^
