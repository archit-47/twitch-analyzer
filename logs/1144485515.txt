[0:25:19] <dotalegendery2> minecraft is always good
[0:25:20] <jspringr88> when the kids take over the computer
[0:25:22] <boxxythegoat> my brother is 4 and he broke his tablet when I bought it for him so
[0:25:24] <dotalegendery2> doesnt matter the age
[0:25:25] <Puddin_Wing> like there's scary monsters and jumpscares and shit
[0:25:28] <ryloo26> i genuinely find minecraft to be boring now

[0:27:47] <Puddin_Wing> that sounds right
[0:28:01] <praeter15> tekkit is a solid pack
[0:28:09] <LowRatedHighlander> Tekkit is probably the one
[0:28:11] <Puddin_Wing> I had fun with it, if that's what i was playing
[0:28:16] <SoporificPanda> fuck these channel points and FUCKFL0M 380 gang
[0:28:19] <Puddin_Wing> the machine progression felt good

[0:28:24] <Nightbot> FUCKFL0M
[0:28:27] <Puddin_Wing> plus you got the magic box that could replicate anything
[0:28:33] <Puddin_Wing> which made grinding for materials a lot less boring

[0:34:04] <Puddin_Wing> Also those guys were total cunts
[0:34:06] <yobtih> I saw a picture of the Frag Venue with people in it. I could smell the 18 year old 'I dont need to shower' cause I've been gaming from here
[0:34:15] <LowRatedHighlander> Whoa
[0:34:18] <Puddin_Wing> I opened for them a couple times before they were famous, hawthorne heights were ALL cunts
