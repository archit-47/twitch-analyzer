[0:09:30] <justdanny> plopski no?
[0:09:33] <erk12> 007deman im just saying i think lucky is a bigger problem than xyp
[0:09:33] <lo33y> Why not rez?
[0:09:34] <jay_mess> Do subs need to be locked in for major as well?
[0:09:34] <ananas197> @fl0m new maps?
[0:09:34] <bluehipp0> they are a publicly trade company, so... basically have to make business decisions
[0:09:36] <AARCC> 100% es3tag been really inconsistant
[0:09:37] <barnumbirr> NiP should just offer 5 gifted to get fl0m
[0:09:37] <justdanny> oh oh oh
[0:09:38] <coletetamthekek_generator> MONEY EZ Prize LUL LUL LUL
[0:09:38] <PneumaPuma> bye bye es3tag, sorry man
[0:09:40] <mrnoobofcs> @fl0m brollan=monesy confirmed?? BatChest

[0:09:46] <justdanny> sadge
[0:09:46] <k1ngmacher> my man esetag can't catch a break
[0:09:47] <DontFlame> rez and brolan can be scary af
[0:09:49] <LowRatedHighlander> As much as that sucks for esetag this means NIP goes back to speaking Swedish
[0:09:49] <mossinator11> @fl0m smooya to EG?
[0:09:50] <N1ckrev> phzy > dev1ce on nip?
[0:09:52] <m4lki3r> We're on ladies and gents!
[0:09:59] <PneumaPuma> when's device coming back 😭
[0:09:59] <ghostdawg247> brolan can take that role ez
[0:10:01] <texerson> farlig to astralis wait wut
[0:10:03] <feilden25> Es3tag is for sure the right choice to go out
[0:10:10] <QuickBrills> Flom to nip
[0:10:11] <izdabest9> Es3tag so unlucky in CS
[0:10:12] <Mangoyusi> es3tag for xyp on astralis maybe? if xyp gets out of his slump
[0:10:12] <bluehipp0> I've got a 27 day streak on Duolingo for Swedish!
[0:10:15] <Mangoyusi> maybe not

[0:10:15] <hammymad1> whats ur thoughts on heroic?
[0:10:25] <PARiAH_TV> Astralis -xyp + es3?
[0:10:29] <007deman> @erk12 Yeah and I wasn't there, so I still aint any wiser. I think Lucky was the biggest issue, but both Xyp's form and blameF's gameplan are big issues too
[0:10:31] <feilden25> Darling to astralis is an interesting move
[0:10:32] <coletetamthekek_generator> say BYE BYE to FNC 2022 BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:10:33] <hobrev> I have a feeling its either es3tag or plopski, and I feel plopski would only make sense if NiP is still huffing that pric3tag copium
[0:10:34] <mrnoobofcs> @bluehipp0 maybe replace device? BatChest
[0:10:40] <ghostdawg247> And Lucky leaving?!? Who's the add on?
[0:10:43] <Cake315> Es3tag the dsestroyer of teams will team up with bubzkji the BENCH to form the ultimate team

[0:10:52] <treadstone6969> 600k euros... and dev1ce was 700k dollars... So they paying more for Brollan than device
[0:10:53] <Hektic2> hi 󠀀
[0:10:54] <Mangoyusi> like blameF can't have xyp9x's roles or he's gonna be slumping really hard

[0:11:03] <justdanny> shoeless crew
[0:11:03] <1Akudamaa> @ghostdawg247 farlig is replacing him
[0:11:04] <patsch99> so Dev1ce will surely come back , otherwise the move is a bit expensive isn´t it?
[0:11:04] <filiduttn> and healthy
[0:11:05] <presidentnoobtin123> esetag could have been good with device @fl0m ?
[0:11:08] <justdanny> cant these guys afford shoes
[0:11:09] <AARCC> Wait so full swedish roster for NIP until deice comes back but man thats gonna be a good roster

[0:39:08] <enoughus> Hey fl0m, at what point should I start playing face it? I have only ever played MM which is straight toxic but reddit tells me to wait till global? I'm not really new and now all my smokes and call outs for each map but don't want to ruin other's experiences
[0:39:14] <raindeathroses> Actually fl0m that windows is called icecream
[0:39:15] <the_avocadoman> wtf is this map

[0:39:36] <LowRatedHighlander> @enoughus do it now. Don’t view faceit as this thing you have to learn before trying view it as a way to learn the game in a better environment
[0:39:39] <Polonium2> wait is brollan going for real i thought they were kidding
[0:39:42] <NibletTide> @enoughus if you've hit MGE, you can start faceit
[0:39:47] <Polonium2> isnt he signed till 2024
[0:39:48] <Kimurantti> @enoughus face it is even more toxic in my experience
[0:39:49] <CSdannyh> @fl0m I'll be honest, I really love the mythic league video. the edit of the logo along with the music is superb. I think once I hit level 10 faceit, I'll definitely be subscribing:)

[1:59:19] <Dynamo_Dave> @burlyboilou from what you've said. I'm going to assume you have a good knowledge of FPS games. if I were you and not worried about $10 (roughly) I'd buy csgo with prime. do some death match to get a feel for the game, or jump into either competitive or unranked games. after a while if you want better servers/more serious games, you could try out faceit free.
