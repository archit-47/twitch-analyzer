[1:02:51] <jadelta> @furdahcs i mean i think both options require sitting in a chair for hours on end but i guess thats why he's a pro streamer and im not

[1:03:11] <uberargyle> @furdahcs I feel like I would actually really struggle with streaming unless I had a sugar daddy. The finances are just so hard unless you get big.

[2:40:08] <furdahcs> you can call me a lot of things but a SCAMMER is not one of them, that's fl0ms job
[2:40:08] <wesinat0r> to test if its rly a poltergeist
