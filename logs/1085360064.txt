[2:08:56] <tox1c1513> @fl0m does zap know that there are meds like bupropion (chantix) that are approved for smoking cessation treatment?
[2:09:01] <lovablespoon> It’s a crazy story, cause nicotine...
[2:09:02] <aren_exe> You in EUR?
[2:09:07] <LogiicoL> that oral fixation is huge
[2:09:08] <pentah_> Vaping imo way more addictive to easy to use
[2:09:09] <MagicMarker1> @Holstaura nope, same shit
[2:09:11] <lordthehagfish> @chat, do you do sock>shoe>sock>shoe or sock>sock>shoe>shoe. assuming you have two legs
[2:09:24] <DullaTPG> sock sock, shoe shoe
[2:09:25] <MrFortyOz> @Stogie6 That happened to my brother KEKW got a girlfriend and she said quit
[2:09:26] <nilllow> Sock sock shoe shoe of course
[2:09:30] <the_gurko> Snus, gods gift to humanity > all other types of tobacco
[2:09:32] <Winston_Dickhill> @lordthehagfish sock sock of course
[2:09:33] <FlameyKumori> It has come to my understanding that our very own Fl0m has turned in to a sellout. He no longer reads chat but only reads the $2 donations he gets. He accuses Frump of being a sellout, but is actually now worse than Frump. Please copy and paste this message to spread awareness. Be careful, selling out can affect a stream near you.
[2:09:34] <justT1LT> lordrefired the latter
[2:09:37] <lovablespoon> Vaping has made me more dependent than cigs
[2:09:38] <SukksGaming> @lordthehagfish Shoe, shoe sock sock. paapoWeird
[2:09:39] <dasfuzion> if u put milk before cereal then you would put your dad before your mum KEKW
[2:09:45] <fricks_lozf> sunflower seeds, gum, anything like that helps

[2:09:58] <lordthehagfish> @sukksgaming Peeposit sit down , let's talk
[2:09:58] <Holstaura> @lordthehagfish what the fuck obviously socks on first. do you put on your pants and underwear by inserting your underwear into each pant leg then putting the whole thing on?
[2:10:00] <D4reL> go talk to a doctor they can help you quit

[2:12:30] <MrFortyOz> Ive been on cigs and vapes for 10 years
[2:12:32] <kingvikingstein> Low ohm vapes have a tiny amount of nicotine compared to stuff like Juul
[2:12:32] <D4reL> @Holstaura Smoking is way down tho. Must be all that free education.
[2:12:32] <DrIsaac> yeah E cigs like Juuls or Puff bars can hook you in fucking quick. I never smoked cigs / vapes, tried my friends juul and I was hooked for months.
[2:12:32] <furdahcs> Stogie6 the founder of juul didnt want kids to smoke it
[2:12:32] <FlameyKumori> I started with cigs, tried vapes, hated it, continued with cigs, then quit

[3:18:28] <Khaeron> If you have clear water out the tap why do you still have bottled water for guests?
[3:18:30] <chebrawski> Valorant is a decent game. They just need to work on the agent balancing, RNG application, weapon metas, map complexity, hitbox consistency, cheater detection, accessibility options, community-made content, HUD design, and they need to tell the tourney observers to actually observe what’s going on.
[3:18:38] <Maetthy> so your ass is also a mouth
[3:18:53] <SupraUK_> but still
[3:18:55] <bassmaster1619> i drink my toliet water so guess good

[4:51:33] <Uwotm08> Squad streams are so buggy in the iOS app! Often you end up with two audio streams playing. It’s not a great experience.
[4:51:36] <realshwayze> 4Weird
[4:51:38] <vchair23> ahhh I see
[4:51:38] <Kraftfull> thats why I have 20 tabs open on diffrent computers Kappa
[4:51:47] <realshwayze> Also hello Fl0m and chat
[4:51:52] <MonoxideDucks> does multistream give the viewer to everyone then as opposed to squads?
[4:51:56] <Clake271> yer
[4:52:01] <lilspunkey> just have 2 tabs open
[4:52:02] <thej6s> How does 1 people watching 2 streams in separate windows count at the moment?

[4:52:13] <letdead> can I get a sheesh in chat
[4:52:16] <stormshitman> they should make it that it doesnt add any viewers and take away nothing would that work?

[4:52:51] <siiiif> i prefer to watch 1 stream with each eye peepoIQ
[4:52:51] <DjupDjup> what if the main stream you watch and the one you're in chat with both get a viewers, but it stops there. so it's capped at 2 views per person effectively
[4:52:55] <StewieTheMad> does anyone remember the multi stream websites from back in the day? How do they work?
[4:52:56] <morph811> what about if i open 10 fl0m streams for 10x channel points Pog

[4:53:24] <mysterionprime> Is deag spamming on belly as bad as people say?
[4:53:28] <Uwotm08> Just being in chat doesn’t give them a viewer. You need the stream open.

[7:32:04] <shrek2on_vhs> so we got spud and wookie playing anyone else?
[7:32:09] <Zeyzo_> This game is fantastic. Just needs to work on communication, aim, map awareness, crosshair placement, economy management, pistol aim, awp flicks, grenade spots, smoke spots, pop flashes, positioning, bomb plant positions, retake ability, bunny hopping, spray control and getting a kill.
[7:32:10] <uniqueabout> KEKW
[7:32:11] <kingvikingstein> I think a reason many new players don't spray is due to changing sens fairly often, which makes spraying seem inconsistent
[7:32:13] <tehbardd> if you need to learn the spray literally shoot the wall for 30min you willhave the first 10 down no problem
[7:32:14] <tzinga7> hi flom
[7:32:18] <thej6s> I usually 3-bullet burst - I find it way easier to control compared to full sprays, which I can't control for shit
