[2:33:49] <2020numbers> mafs 3Head
[2:33:49] <Puddin_Wing> like do you refer to the entire discipline as mathematic
[2:33:50] <MartinPhD> i cant read either thats why im a neurobiology major Sadge
[2:33:52] <Puddin_Wing> no it's mathematics
[2:33:52] <lilspunkey> theBadoba then whats 9+10 monkaHmm

[2:34:19] <MartinPhD> love physics and all but it makes my brain hurt
[2:34:19] <nondscript> because math doesn't have an S at the end
[2:34:25] <Puddin_Wing> mathematics does
[2:34:30] <nondscript> but math does not
[2:34:32] <MartinPhD> meth>math
[2:34:35] <Puddin_Wing> But math isn't a word
[2:34:37] <2020numbers> PauseFish
[2:34:40] <nondscript> niether is maths
[2:34:41] <viking_mercenary> meth is 3Head
[2:34:47] <Puddin_Wing> It's a contraction for mathematics
[2:34:51] <nondscript> so is math
[2:34:52] <amj3ff> meth requires math
[2:34:53] <2020numbers> monkaHmm
[2:34:54] <Roddricktv> yo fl0m is popping off in these scrims today Pog
[2:34:54] <STatisfacti0n> speaking of physics, I have to take dynamics this semester FeelsBadMan
[2:34:57] <theBaboda> See if you guys can't do any sort of math just be an architect and tell me it works on paper YEP
[2:34:57] <Puddin_Wing> But maths is plural
[2:34:59] <siiiif> math is short for mathematic
[2:35:00] <Puddin_Wing> so why not pluralize it
[2:35:09] <MartinPhD> does that mean that meth is methamatics
[2:35:14] <nondscript> you don't say gooses
[2:35:15] <lilspunkey> peepoFoil
[2:35:15] <theBaboda> YEP
