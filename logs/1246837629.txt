[2:32:34] <NateOnAPlate> The impossible one is pretty nice
[2:32:40] <Terminat0r44> Half a point, plus you could have a spare GPU too cause usually the GPU in prebuilts are kinda shit
[2:32:44] <waferthinmint> beyond meat is what Monterey burritos has been using for years and calling it "Beef" with added vegetable proteins and starches
[2:32:44] <BrettisBased> Jammies

[2:38:14] <aetherealphoenix> @kimplesthe2nd basically, gpu's have their own memory bank when generating the graphics. so usually more gives you room to really crank out the detail but that also comes down to architecture and it's performance.

[7:09:53] <stormshitman> i quote ‚ÄúFirst off they‚Äôll lie to sell the puppies and they also charge double what the breeder does. They change their name, is that normal? They are the biggest puppymill supporter in America.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDo not purchase an animal from this company. They do not do a good job screening their breeders and don‚Äôt really care what happens once they get your money! When the puppy arrived we noticed something strange about his lack of energy and playfulness. Sure enough the breeder shipped him with parvo and
[7:10:12] <stormshitman> and he was dying right before our very eyes!
[7:10:17] <stormshitman> thats what it says

[7:13:11] <connorbh111> flom check montcorn, marissa rose, and 3 playful kennels for dachshund breeders in vegas
[7:13:40] <Mazvydas> in my past life i was a licensed dog breeder, and with my time in the circuit i can tell that the best dogs/care/etc can only be found with breeders that don't advertise, usually the waiting list is 1-2+ years for a dog and the prices are more than most people want to spend
[7:14:10] <connorbh111> just found em on google but i def trust yall to research
[7:14:27] <Madfish2021> Beware! I spent almost 3400.00 dollars for a purebred long hair miniature Dachshund at PuppySpot.I felt guilty because I have always gotten rescue dogs. However, I really wanted a miniature long haired Dachshund puppy. I got him and instantly fell in love. My Wellness plan at the vet automatically does a DNA test. I started to not even open it, but I did. However, when I got the DNA test back I found out he is only 37.5% miniature long hair Dachshund! He is 50% short haired miniature Dachshund
[7:14:54] <Icexiety> Maybe they will leak too
[7:15:01] <Madfish2021> He is 50% short haired miniature Dachshund and 12.5% terrier/other. As a resolution they said I could give him back and get a refund, or they would give me 350.00. She stated that the 350 was a courtesy and they didn‚Äôt have to do that. So, if you want to pay for a purebred puppy and get one who isn‚Äôt even 50% what you paid for, this is the place for you!
[7:15:05] <stormshitman> @Madfish2021 i read them its disgusting
[7:15:07] <Gimpy783> fl0m my wife works with a pet rescue here in AZ... if we stumble across any dachs, want me to tweet at ya?
[7:15:38] <stormshitman> i have always found the pet industry very disturbing
[7:15:45] <connorbh111> yeah travel is also one thing for good breeders. parents had to drive across 2 provinces to a breeder for an akita
[7:15:48] <stormshitman> cuz 99 percent is sketchy af with mistreated animals

[7:43:27] <McBubba03> That rivalry is going to be HELLAWICKED
[7:43:31] <yobtih> I don't see how shox will fit into this team at all
[7:43:39] <Madfish2021> So does that mean Fnatic are UKCS now fl0mB
[7:43:47] <Nightbot> Latest video: What Happens When fl0m Plays CS:GO with a NEW Team?! - https://youtu.be/rvv0TIRfDsY
[7:43:48] <McBubba03> yobtih he probably won't and TL is going to have to learn that the hard way
[7:43:53] <Madfish2021> If so I‚Äôm now a Fnatic fan
[7:43:59] <MANIKcc> keeping as many teams relevant as possible def the move
[7:44:04] <yobtih> could've picked up someone young and molded them instead they have a player just looking to make a comeback (aka fallen)
[7:44:21] <McBubba03> Madfish2021 UK person?
[7:44:27] <McBubba03> Madfish2021 like you live in the UK?
[7:44:29] <Madfish2021> Do you think floppy would have been a good fit instead ?
