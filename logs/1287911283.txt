[0:18:00] <Paroto7> I like both teams . I don't know which team to support in the match
[0:18:06] <s1mply_AnT> @Onyo1337 at least its balanced
[0:18:06] <just__curious> Vitality lost to Faze though and G2 went undefeated
[0:18:08] <bobongtalong> @Onyo1337 thats just a fact
[0:18:08] <wobbie> @saltyasd right? got dayum
[0:18:09] <Cacemen> fl0m you know I found the most interesting about this vitality team? the fact that they can play so well even without zywoo being able to talk in English. It really shows how good he is he just let's is gameplay talk
[0:18:13] <SpykerLOL> G2 is still kinda unknown what they can achieve
[0:18:14] <mukulhayaran> fl0m you know I found the most interesting about this vitality team? the fact that they can play so well even without zywoo being able to talk in English. It really shows how good he is he just let's is gameplay talk
[0:18:22] <Paasss> imo getting Zonic as the coach is a bigger move than both players for Vitality

[2:23:04] <agammax> they have no roster
[2:23:06] <PerhapsItsPeach> i think doesn;t help
[2:23:06] <Wookiegaming> losing to many entrys
[2:23:07] <St0neGG> no dev1ce yeah
[2:23:08] <tavez_> hampus rez and plop getting multi kills
[2:23:09] <flipflapflopflipperflaps> device would help LUL
[2:23:09] <agammax> its changed every month
[2:23:11] <pastor12443> luck tbh
[2:23:11] <JuiceW4H> they need a device
[2:23:15] <agammax> and non are consistent
[2:23:15] <michnas> dont forget its ancient ct side
[2:23:16] <St0neGG> missing piece is majorrrr
[2:23:17] <YuutsuUK> NiP are getting outaimed
[2:23:19] <t0nylab> looks like they're kinda getting read no?
[2:23:19] <tavez_> if hampus and plopski aren't playing well it's gg
[2:23:20] <Y0ungb1> go playing out of their mind
[2:23:21] <Bezonians> og hits ALL the shots
[2:23:21] <m1cgg> they are depending on explosive moments instead of consistent kills
[2:23:21] <LowRatedHighlander> RAW JuiceW4H
[2:23:21] <Piesso> they won off a gimmick play, not very impressing by NiP rly
[2:23:22] <PerhapsItsPeach> twitch chat are Pepega
[2:23:23] <cptlayz> Plopski is the problem
[2:23:23] <Justhoohaa> I don't think they have depth in maps
[2:23:24] <St0neGG> and CT side
[2:23:24] <Terie54> Es3tag is mucho not good
[2:23:25] <GeorgeLincolnRockweII> Es3tag is the most overrated pro in the last 3 years
[2:23:26] <MoonPhoeniix> just bad luck they are playing really good
[2:23:27] <l1tb0i> wtf how did this end up being the game today....... navi???? g2????
[2:23:28] <mukulhayaran> GoodTake
[2:23:29] <lonelycl0ne> How old is this nip roster?
[2:23:30] <Justhoohaa> personally
[2:23:33] <Call_Me_Moldzyn> I have a hard time seeing NIP doing well this year without changes
[2:23:34] <ROJO1868> didnt NIP be at Navi??
[2:23:38] <doctordoctor_> og is just outfragging them
[2:23:39] <hay_stacc> Nip playing like VP.
[2:23:39] <Justhoohaa> they win the pug maps
[2:23:39] <fedl1ngen> @fl0m their main problem is that hampus is the hard carry.
[2:23:39] <hobrev> NiP has its moments but they are just that, every player is capable of taking over on singular rounds but it feels like most time that is all they have
[2:23:39] <k3ny0nn> they just need more consistent players imo
[2:23:41] <ROJO1868> beat
[2:23:43] <Cake315> device is washed and will only ruin NIP but pricetag is not worth his money
[2:23:44] <tavez_> @fl0m hampus is their highest rated player this tournament so that's the issue
[2:23:45] <7nsve> @fl0m biggest anti-phozy fan

[2:24:04] <k1ngmacher> they lack firepower
[2:24:05] <jonnypondwater> hey fl0,
[2:24:06] <PerhapsItsPeach> I think NIP are having the same issues complexity had, lots of uncertainty hamstringing results fl0m
[2:24:08] <jonnypondwater> fl0m

[2:24:20] <GeorgeLincolnRockweII> Es3tag is not tier 1
[2:24:20] <frederickcs_> i think they need an igl to let hampus flourish
[2:24:25] <CallsignColin> just jealous of his looks honestly
[2:24:26] <SupraUK_> fl0m hates 'em cos he ain't 'em
[2:24:27] <lonelycl0ne> FUCKFL0M

[2:24:28] <Nightbot> hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
[2:24:28] <smackey11> EVERY FUCKING DAY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT PHZY OVER DEVICE

[2:24:43] <PARiAH_TV> Without dev1ce, and with Rez being so inconsistent, they lack a star player
[2:24:44] <Importunity> fuckk my vote T_T I thought nip was goated on ancient WTFFF
[2:24:50] <Piesso> imo, rez is super overrated

[2:26:54] <PerhapsItsPeach> DonkDink
[2:26:54] <tavez_> It's literally the fact that their best fragger is hampus. When your IGL is the best player on the team it's going to be rough

[2:27:01] <Terie54> If you would have told me 4 years ago that Hampus from Red Reserve would be a top 5 IGL in 2022 I would have slapped you
[2:27:03] <Piesso> so nori got you the wallet and we are filling it up?
[2:27:13] <hobrev> amazingly, some brand shoes are actually really good
[2:27:17] <Kalgara5> hampus is pretty good eh
[2:27:28] <datkidaa> Drop shoe name and brand thx
[2:27:30] <m1cgg> NIP depend on explosive moments instead of consistent kills, imo
[2:27:33] <Bolly> also they seem to rely on "hampus go kill" to win rounds consistently

[2:28:02] <SukksGaming> What happened to dev1ce? Is he starring in a movie again as a double for Tom Cruise?
[2:28:02] <Dameey_> plopski's mechanics sometimes look a bit meh imo, for a pro that is
[2:28:05] <meatyclaws33> i agree, es3tag and rez need to be the hard hitters
[2:28:07] <kcerwniart> wheres heaton
[2:28:19] <Terie54> I just dont think Es3tag is very good
[2:28:19] <penguinpunch> They need Rez to be a star and most of the time he’s just not
[2:28:21] <BLUE__f0x> changing a player every two month is probably more important
[2:28:26] <GeorgeLincolnRockweII> Es3tag had one good map in astralis and somehow because a “superstar”
[2:28:36] <GrimRx_0> do you need blast to approve you in order to do a watch party like this?

[2:37:01] <YuutsuUK> I think REZ could leave tbh
[2:37:03] <5thrabbit> ive never thought es3tag was bad but hes always just been so underwhelming everywhere hes gone
[2:37:03] <MelloChellow> Grill BOOBA Kapp

[2:37:15] <skearns458> bring back ztr lol
[2:37:16] <whatisit18181> Picking up a danish average rifler was questionable
[2:37:24] <Cake315> idk es3tag is just not good in these teams he plays in
[2:37:24] <AustrianFarmer> it feels like Rez is playing not too bad
[2:37:26] <speciality_> I think they brought him in to make devve feel better idk
[2:37:28] <BLUE__f0x> they should just get a decent igl tbh
[2:37:29] <ElaD_O> kinda wonder what OG would be like if they got hampus instead of Nexa
[2:37:35] <o_OMystic> I mean the best rifler on Australia is blamef
[2:37:44] <SukksGaming> that crossfire Kreygasm
[2:37:44] <s1mply_AnT> would you say BIG clan has the same issue @fl0m?

[2:37:52] <PatentTomato> why have we seen a bunch of people on the regular m4a4 this tourney
[2:37:52] <bot_left1e> the goddamn guy dude
[2:37:57] <Bolly> people have been waiting for Rez to be "the guy" for 2 or 3 years now
[2:37:57] <spencerayy> R EZ
[2:38:00] <Bolly> he needs to go
[2:38:02] <mamluku> rez is turning into flamie
[2:38:03] <noviet_al_dente> we need R EZ
[2:38:03] <YuutsuUK> REZ hasn't been the guy for years now
[2:38:04] <Zyrxsu> they should get golden and have hampus pure rifle
[2:38:04] <Miksu2222> Rez has been on and off, eseteag has just been off
[2:38:07] <flipflapflopflipperflaps> double flash es3tag Clap
[2:38:08] <Call_Me_Moldzyn> @kcerwniart  tbh they shouldve outplayed them individually , its not that NIP is a heavily structured team like BIG that tries to antistrat you hard
[2:38:09] <Nood1eBuddy> rez is a beta tho doesn't have that killer instinct
[2:38:09] <flames2802> i didnt see the big issue with lnz
[2:38:09] <kcerwniart> @JoshEqualsSic the one dude looks like hes 12 haha why they lettin this boi die
[2:38:10] <diamonndcc> i really don t understand how nip beat na vi
[2:38:11] <Piesso> -rez -phzy +jkaem +hallzerk could be cool
[2:38:12] <elitheegreat> unrelated question but did tarik retire or is there still hope?
[2:38:13] <brazzerschris> REZ ceiling is so high, it makes me sad he is so inconsitent
[2:38:13] <marsquirrel> REZ has a really high ceiling but also a really low floor
[2:38:14] <michnas> rez is inconsistent
[2:38:15] <sn1pie> they should try to get brollan
[2:38:21] <smackey11> +draken
[2:38:21] <nanerpus_> The real problem child here is all these m4a4
[2:38:23] <JoshEqualsSic> @kcerwniart hahaha thats what i was thinking he looks like a damn child
[2:38:31] <ManzerRox97> REZ was always a great anchor
[2:38:32] <hay_stacc> Get f0rest LUL
[2:38:36] <PARiAH_TV> Where the fuck do we even rank REZ these days? I mean the potential is there, but he is so damn inconsistent
[2:38:37] <SukksGaming> BOP
[2:38:37] <whatisit18181> REZ has been the next one to bat for years, not sure why he’s even in the conversation anymore
[2:38:52] <diamonndcc> flamie s still hot
[2:38:54] <Tilbakestaende> Rez is allmost like Rain, but NIp cant afford the inconsistency
[2:38:54] <diamonndcc> LUL
[2:38:56] <Bolly> and then he became one 30-bomb every 6 months
[2:38:56] <Nood1eBuddy> yeah rez a beta
[2:38:58] <phishstrangler75> ogs will remember

[2:39:10] <BLUE__f0x> noway anyone thinks hampus is a good igl
[2:39:11] <kcerwniart> ogs will remember zex at eswc
[2:39:14] <DalinDaDude> +flusha and let hampus loose without being an igl
[2:39:16] <whatisit18181> Flamie is still young

[2:39:59] <mamluku> @fl0m nip should pull the trigger , the longer they wait to cut esetag and rez the worse it gets
[2:39:59] <jokkerbo> @fl0m I'm assuming that NiP signed devi knowing that his health could be an issue right?  or did this come out of left field
[2:40:04] <YuutsuUK> Who would be the best addition to NiP?
[2:40:06] <GeorgeLincolnRockweII> Is device depressed

[3:01:17] <Tvjuli> 4-5 devs handle the most played game on steam
[3:01:19] <sebybeast> Ask get right
[3:01:19] <malikelfandi> i really think that rez overrall is kind of underratted
[3:01:20] <yu__ng> the game still gets updates, ofc they care KEKW

[3:01:39] <Dynamo_Dave> for 4/5 devs. they do a lot.
[3:01:39] <Phi0_> Almost like Game Developers really do enjoy making games and aren't in it just for fame and glory
[3:01:39] <diamonndcc> PLEASE OT
[3:01:41] <jokkerbo> or wondering why the team is so small for the most successful FPS franchise of all time, but hey
[3:01:43] <BL4CKHOUSE> @fl0m you think CS will ever get a graphics update?
[3:01:45] <Chumbo767> why did tey kick so many devs before
[3:01:48] <thegunarse> valve has no interest just to milk cs fans
[3:01:49] <steelarm77> imagine if they were not on valve and could actually talk about things they were interested in and excited for Sadge
[3:01:51] <jokkerbo> Madge
[3:01:53] <fareminkers> be Madge at valve for not giving more resources and devs fl0m
[3:01:54] <sarge10> isnt that the downside of youth teams most good young players are probably contracted
[3:01:54] <BL4CKHOUSE> unreal 5 or source 2?
[3:01:54] <Inversion101> the problem isnt the devs not caring, the problem is why does a billion dollar company only have 4 devs
[3:01:55] <ezio_desmondmiles> they can always use community maps
[3:01:56] <whatisit18181> 10 year old game pog
[3:02:03] <SuperRunee> Fl0m serving some copium
[3:02:03] <averysimorr> @fl0m d0cc
[3:02:04] <SEANEHKELLEH> @jokkerbo because it can be, Valve love money.
[3:02:05] <kcerwniart> the devs dont care has been  a narrative in this game since the 1.X days lol
[3:02:10] <vailant_> can't valve hire some "anchor" devs to work on 1 game and have the other devs rotate around games?
[3:02:14] <shawcsgo2022> gg near lol
[3:02:20] <apoodle_> maybe fps game quality is inversely correlated with teams size, would explain why cod is lame for once
[3:02:22] <diamonndcc> @whatisit18181 older than most valorant players LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:32] <Destructoid5858> If I worked at Valve I would 100% only work on CSGO
[3:02:33] <iVex> OG's map pick btw
[3:02:33] <crownbutter> @BL4CKHOUSE Nope Just made a new game if they Change engine
[3:02:34] <twennyNumbers> %? 34
[3:02:34] <Nightbot> Joris says 65%
[3:02:35] <0nze0> @averysimorr he aint swedish though
[3:02:37] <Destructoid5858> I would love that
[3:02:38] <twennyNumbers> k
[3:02:40] <ChesterNugget> didn't alyx allude to more half lifes?
[3:02:40] <Pappy_Pud> lets see if es3tag entries A and they rotate over again
[3:02:42] <speciality_> Guys ofc you’ll care more about csgo then valve does. Csgo makes them much much less than steam does
[3:02:46] <pastor12443> why do people prefer the ak to the m4? surely the m4 is better since the recoil is easier
[3:02:50] <Floofys> I want to work at valve, dammit. Seems like such a cool company
[3:02:51] <thegunarse> its been a year and overwatch is still broken

[3:35:07] <vinciCS> angus799 yeah, i know he had picked it up before on occasion but he doesn't have it enough to be called a secondary, i agree
[3:35:09] <hemo_tox> If braindead scalper apologists put any thought into their arguments they'd drop the "Supply and Demand Pepega shit" and argue its "Price Discovery", but they're mainly actual monkeys so here we are
[3:35:09] <frykis88> still a shortage tho
[3:35:10] <Crokpot57> @fl0m i heard scalpers were selling fl0m subs now

[3:35:21] <jockst3r> its so insane to be that people cant get a hold of ps5

[3:46:51] <abildlund> @fl0m, the problem with Astralis is Gla1ve? They have never relied on Xyp to post big numbers, but Gla1ve have done so consistently in the past. Now his fragging in kind of meh
[3:46:52] <gxxky> when was the last time you had a fl0mJob on stream

[3:47:44] <young_buck42> @fl0m how is the doggo(s) doing today
[3:47:46] <paracetamolhelps> @fl0m is it just me who feels like EG, and COL have potential but something is telling me liquid will fall flat on their face

[3:48:16] <stompyjoe> Dupreeh and magisk probably so happy being at vitality
[3:48:21] <friendlymackerel> astralis are used to a consistently strong awp
[3:48:30] <Sealer9> they just signed xyp to like a 3 year contract that man ain't goiogn anywhere
[3:48:31] <kcerwniart> flamez wtf\
[3:48:34] <RhinoIsInDenial> But Konfig is hot Madge
[3:48:40] <hilimee> hard to be hot when a team isnt meshing

[3:49:21] <valar1003> @stompyjoe they left for a reason
[3:49:24] <EINacho> do you think forcing blameF to entry and giving xyp lurk would help?
[3:49:31] <alexis809s> nikodoz is a good move

[3:49:56] <regulate312> If i just started playing cs, is it worth it to get prime status?
[3:50:01] <paracetamolhelps> you see blamef is tiltF just how is individual performance docked when col as a team played bad blamef cannot play well in a tilt enviroment
[3:50:06] <dolev801> @fl0m what do you think about lowering the kit price+ct molly price

[3:55:30] <hobrev> "oh no I missed the first half what a bother"
[3:55:32] <tavez_> they force him so passive and never let him go for picks
[3:55:32] <rygaardhansen> Just get NIP that million, so dev1ce can come back
[3:55:34] <unfortunateunlucky> it's more like signing matt cassel and him wanting to play WR
[3:55:35] <alexis809s> WR was the move for TB12
[3:55:37] <eclipse42> AFTERNOON CHAT X @fl0m

[3:55:44] <easton_0> @fl0m do you think same “he’s doing ok so he’s good” mentality applies to osee? Or do you think that’s a situation unique from these others
[3:55:45] <BrotherJon> 77777777777 :)
[3:55:49] <angus799> @tavez_ "they force him so passive"
[3:55:52] <B1LLS0N> G2 down bad
[3:55:56] <Morde24> @tavez_ it's his job as the awper to be more aggressive and take early round duels.

[3:56:15] <tavez_> @Morde24 it would be his job if it wasn't astralis literally forcing him to play like that
[3:56:24] <LittleLaoui> @fl0m wasnt NiP supposed to switch phzy with jackinho after this?
[3:56:29] <kenichidc> Osee is imo an impact awper
[3:56:29] <tavez_> you can tell from watching the games they do not let him go for those plays cause he's the youngest player
[3:56:30] <dala1990_> shox list is weird
[3:56:33] <gxxky> is 87-0 isn't S tier what era team could ever
[3:56:35] <Morde24> @tavez_ please explain to me how you know Astralis is forcing him to play passive
[3:56:36] <hilimee> @fl0m I thought osee looked very good the other day
[3:56:39] <alexis809s> Osee is insane
[3:56:41] <angus799> @LittleLaoui thats like 0 difference
[3:56:41] <ThePhvraoh> osee is getting impact too

[3:57:08] <Phi0_> ELIGE???
[3:57:10] <kenichidc> elige needs to reinvent himself no cap
[3:57:10] <ShadowZH> osee is  actually going for plays too
[3:57:11] <Floofys> fl0m do you think there's a lot of impostor syndrome in pro CSGO?
[3:57:12] <Sealer9> liquid hasn't looked as cohesive as they did at blast in months.. sure didn't go well but its amazing what happens when u have a primary awper
[3:57:14] <hobrev> :D
[3:57:16] <SpykerLOL> ADS GIB ADS
[3:57:30] <NebChilly> oSee also had 1.27 rating in tier 2 it's not a surprise he's so good
[3:57:30] <SoporificPanda> in what reality is astralis saying "please sit back and have no impact :) "
[3:57:31] <angus799> he did fine, better than lucky lmao
[3:57:37] <Ewy_Qwarp> ADS FL0MATHAN
[3:57:37] <hobrev> oSee actually played like he played in ES
[3:57:42] <hobrev> which was really good to see

[3:58:57] <tavez_> I mean that's fair but dev1ce and lucky are very different players
[3:58:58] <devoutchristian> Wardell is the savior astralis need
[3:59:07] <PerhapsItsPeach> i'm not being sarcastic when I say this, I'd take NAtosaphix over lucky fl0m
[3:59:09] <lilcmo> @paracetamolhelps his playstyle requires him to be peak form ,,,,, hes a rly aggro awp
[3:59:13] <NebChilly> Lucky is a literal child
[3:59:14] <Sniper_Cow> and we know he can be insane
[3:59:18] <lilcmo> yea dudes just gotta hit his stride fr
[3:59:26] <we3bly> wardell KEKW

[4:00:08] <nacho_bsp> trainswreck playing for nip, pog
[4:00:11] <easton_0> Osee seems to have a great intuition about when to push for impact, when to hold, and when to fall back and he seems well rounded
[4:00:13] <kyouki__> lucky has unbelivable support players around him
[4:00:16] <51_nzt> G I R L
[4:00:16] <kyouki__> no excuses

[4:08:25] <SoporificPanda> harrsh_ it does reduce game chat when you are flashed, but that part is not a problem IMO. the only real issue is that it is hard to comm to teammates when you are dead because of the volume reduction

[4:16:22] <nanerpus_> because premier doesnt even know how many teams they need for each season
[4:16:24] <Morde24> premier itself is ass, and ESEA is so trash with it's rulings that it can probably be detrimental more often than not

[5:27:40] <Uwotm08> Herman Miller is international but they're generally too expensive for the rest of the world. I mostly know them from stories about the late 90s dotcom bubble.

[5:37:31] <m1cgg> true
[5:37:33] <Ficii> NA has about 10% of csgo player base
[5:37:41] <friendlymackerel> they could either stay in cs and make min wage playing mdl for balls gaming or go to val and play for massive orgs and make bank
[5:37:42] <xstevennnn> NA is actually insanely competitive considering the ratio of player bases

[6:11:13] <elitheegreat> if ur jerkin a horse off with lotion and use voice activation you are a bad person

[7:16:07] <redmundocs> yes many ppl think redman cheat too
[7:16:11] <nayrs_tv> Didn't ropz have to go to the FACEIT office to prove he wasn't cheating?
[7:16:11] <SavouryLobster> !cheating
[7:16:12] <Nightbot> This argument is horrible. People said the same about Lance Armstrong back in the day. "He definitely won't cheat" is a bad argument, people cheat. Guys that are the face of charities like Armstrong cheat, all us humans have the capability to cheat inside.
[7:16:12] <Ficii> @angus799 b1t? Nobody knew who bit was considering he wasn't even in fpl
[7:16:15] <SukksGaming> forsaken might be cheating Kappa
