[0:12:25] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m dude, the observing was fucking awful
[0:12:25] <n0r13k> I watched the Dreamhack stream last night, and there was a lot of people that I've seen in this chat voice their dissatisfaction about the casting. I'll be honest, I thought it was cool as fuck that they got Stewie Griffin from Family Guy to do an entire BO3.
[0:12:27] <BizarreMark> peepoW what did casters do now?
[0:12:29] <WookiePotamus> @Puddin_Wing i just thought u were some sort of Ethereal being that graced chat with your presents so u were just never unsubbed
[0:12:31] <beardyfragz> the observing wasnt that great overall tbh
[0:12:31] <dreamshadow0> D:
[0:12:32] <PopRoxYoutube> I was far more bothered by the observers
[0:12:32] <STatisfacti0n> I tweeted at them
[0:12:33] <Puddin_Wing> I got popped so many fuckin times for literally nothing by their automod
[0:12:35] <datkidaa> They barely had the camera on fl0m tbh
[0:12:35] <Dynamo_Dave> where's chezpuf when you need him
[0:12:35] <san2194> the observer saw 0 kills across all 3 maps fl0m
[0:12:37] <VashTS1> Yo fl0m, why do the cans of gfuel taste so different than the powder?
[0:12:38] <cardboardtoast> @fl0m please ask them to hire the silvercast observer next time -.-
[0:12:38] <CiMoranTV> dayum
[0:12:40] <quaazzy> @dreamshadow0 get reked kid0

[0:13:13] <Puddin_Wing> I mean, they probably just ran to Valorant because ESIC was investigating their matchfixing
[0:13:15] <LukeryD> @MaxofMine Sadge
[0:13:16] <Justhoohaa> I think Laski  wants to come back for a bit. he did he hasn't been feeling valorant lately
[0:13:21] <Puddin_Wing> And now that ESIC hasn't done shit they're coming back
[0:13:23] <dreamshadow0> flamie to Team Singulariy @fl0m ?
[0:13:27] <furdahcs> nasthic dont tell him what to do
[0:13:27] <rekleov_> they couldnt make it in CS, thought they could in another game, realized they cant use abilities well, come back and still suck
