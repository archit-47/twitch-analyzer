[1:37:26] <Puddin_Wing> canada's a liberal conspiracy myth made up to scare your children. Just like dolphins, space, and the WNBA

[1:37:41] <praeter15> what is the WNBA
[1:37:59] <RibssTheGamer> seriouosly fucking cool. all the other pro sports here have college teams. College CS teams are the beginning of an american pro league @fl0m
[1:37:59] <clutchdame0> just having a school behind you is the way out if your pro careers dont work out for you

[1:38:31] <BeanosTV> Esports school in sweden is like high school but gaming
[1:38:44] <djsmart> First esport facility for university/colleges on east coast of Canada was uoit/Durham college no?
[1:38:53] <itsHalen> parents see things in a monetary way, so when you say scholarship they can put an amount to it.
[1:38:54] <aIexcs> my school has a cs team, which i am a part of, but we are working to get recognized as a D1 sport (I go to a d1 school) meaning a shit ton of funding and other stuff
[1:38:57] <Stogie6> djsmart Ontario is not east coast
[1:38:58] <RavenUKRP> I put all my money I earnt from WC3 into going to university it made a dent, but it wasn't a scholarship
