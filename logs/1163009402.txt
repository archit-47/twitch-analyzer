[1:34:43] <STatisfacti0n> @sillonar not sure. I've never gotten it
[1:34:46] <Doccy> pretty sure it's only started happening recently
[1:34:51] <STatisfacti0n> ^
[1:34:56] <STatisfacti0n> like since a couple of patches ago
[1:35:10] <slynde> it rarely occurs when you drop or highlight weapons
[1:35:14] <Doccy> i assume the ping system in cs is built off the ping system in L4D
[1:35:27] <STatisfacti0n> same doccy
[1:35:30] <Doccy> so most likely some patch that changed the ping system introduced this bug
[1:35:31] <sillonar> That would make sense.
[1:36:06] <ImTarco> Valve never uses new things in Source games. Everything is recycled.
