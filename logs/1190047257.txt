[0:55:54] <Jaseto88> It seems that NIP might need some favourable match-ups to proceed
[0:56:03] <Kisse667> Could they be content if the signed Dupreeh after this year???

[0:59:07] <charleschandler> BUBSKI TO MYTHIC WHEN
[0:59:07] <Rasmalai06> I strayed away from csgo for a while now...what happened to astralis?
[0:59:10] <M3n0H> navi will probably sell monesy, no spots for him on the main roster
[0:59:11] <DesiredHeadshot> LUL
[0:59:13] <Speedrulez> ropz would be perfect if they shifted from swedish

[0:59:30] <dotalegendery2> bubski nip could also work
[0:59:35] <Thatonepand> Dupreeh to NiP
[0:59:35] <Koi_CSGO_> they're good but not quite as natural as you'd like
[0:59:38] <muddychor> tenz could have been in liquid and won a major no cap
[0:59:39] <dotalegendery2> bubskji
[0:59:46] <filiduttn> give me dupreeh, i would be happy

[0:59:52] <sh1f0> they still lack some experience, they dn have that elite game sense yet, u see them make errors the likes of zywoo, dupreeh, s1mple dn do
[1:00:03] <Nightbot> There is no delay between us and fl0m. Between fl0m and the stream he is watching is a 2 minute delay. He does it this way so he can interact with us and abide by the guidelines
[1:00:03] <skzzcs> yeah what do u think of monesy future for cs? @fl0m

[3:30:01] <Nightbot> There is no delay between us and fl0m. Between fl0m and the stream he is watching is a 2 minute delay. He does it this way so he can interact with us and abide by the guidelines
[3:30:02] <undercoverbulbasaur> they have them now
[3:30:03] <SpykerLOL> They have when they play in the studio
[3:30:08] <marcus7445> they have player cams on the PGL stream
[3:30:18] <max1mum> yeah i agree
[3:30:19] <EchoCordis> player cams are only on for A stream
[3:30:21] <Jaerdekartt> very little tech pauses though. which is a huge plus
[3:30:25] <Rocketgamer102> Like Big Chill'n
[3:30:28] <j43_ttv> i love how a scout buy can be real good in a round and could be without impact in a round
[3:30:29] <SepiDrunk> big chillin MmmHmm

[3:31:04] <Squtzy> Is the low fps radar part of the issue? @fl0m
[3:31:10] <dmw_xx> true delays r worse than any bad viewing experience
[3:31:21] <Rocketgamer102> Is it a BO5 Grand Final?

[3:32:32] <random_factz> :) > smileW
[3:32:44] <NewAJeOutlaw> fl0m on twitter they said that the A stream games will be in studio and B stream in practice so I'm assuming that both the A stream teams will be on stage?
[3:32:49] <need_a_name__> will legends stage have bo1 ?

[3:33:21] <Squtzy> @need_a_name__ Main stage will start off with BO1. Finals will be bo3's
[3:33:39] <max1mum> ropz needs to instantly trade and clutch
[3:33:40] <hobrev> tabsen still has the skill to be a top10 player in the world
[3:33:50] <kooshyy> @fl0m syrson is good but on t side dust he wasnt the best
[3:33:50] <onv0y> tabsen def more consistent than the rest of the team lol
[3:33:56] <flipflapflopflipperflaps> syrson is nutty
[3:33:58] <53Shakur> tabsen is a nice guy :)
[3:34:04] <n0r13k> this isn't a slight against either of you, but you and acor have very similar play styles
[3:34:11] <Envy2ndSin> @fl0m did liquid qualify for the major

[3:35:00] <Marethyuji> @crustypig1, yes
[3:35:03] <yobtih> Why don‚Äôt they just space out the games on the same stage instead?
[3:35:13] <Deagent9> it was hype to see a pick on cross  through doors
[3:35:13] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m I saw the pgl practice room in navi's vlog they can definitely change that into a studio, space is a bit less but yes they can
[3:35:14] <yobtih> Start earlier, end later. Etc.
[3:35:14] <hobrev> legends stage will have the same system as challengers did

[4:21:48] <brandonjxavier> is there some website or way to see how many wins needed for rank ups? @fl0m
[4:21:56] <ImTarco> Isn't there a setup where observers get server info for kills slightly ahead of time?
[4:21:56] <Nightbot> Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
[4:21:59] <peach_vs_mango> caster: tells a story.. observer: starts a youtube video
[4:22:03] <giraffemofo> good point
[4:22:05] <LowRatedHighlander> @brandonjxavier in mm?
[4:22:08] <ninetyfivemonkeys> So are the observers and the casters working exclusively for pgl or do you do multiple events across multiple orgs?

[7:11:19] <kickingTV> different mentality I think. It's like in chess, you always pick what you're best for, not what the opponent is weak for. Idk what to think about it
[7:11:20] <m0FFFFF> Cuz they made him change his anime girl pfp
[7:11:22] <stankonya445> @fl0m u think they keep lucky if they make a "run"

[7:11:31] <AedanE1> @fl0m wat map would u say asttalis is weak on?
[7:11:37] <Bezonians> it mostly looks like astralis really understood how spirit wanna play long and mid

[7:20:37] <LiveYourLifeNerd> fl0m did they just allow you to watch the stream btw? after problems with GOTV
[7:20:39] <NebChilly> he's making rookie mistakes theyre going for safe picks with awp

[7:20:54] <STatisfacti0n> @WES1NAT0R that's too niche though. body shots wise, the a1 is always faster. plus except for point blank, hitting two back to back headshots with the a4 is actually really tough due to the how the model/hitbox moves
[7:20:55] <LowRatedHighlander> @einacho no the problem is they benched bubz even though he got them to the major for lucky to be a main awper

[7:52:15] <LowRatedHighlander> This is a hard one
[7:52:17] <RobertCamposs> s1mple with multi kill is the safe pick
[7:52:18] <silvernade> Furia can be 0:3 too, they have an academy awper
[7:52:18] <Notifly> thats same liklihood as fl0m shaving his beard
[7:52:20] <ShiBailey> c9 winning the major
[7:52:20] <stankonya445> g2 0-3

There are regulars here. $5 a month. How do you have hours of time to watch fl0m and not $5. I don't know, what are you doing with your life where you have hours of time to watch fl0m and not $5 to provide for the content you're watching. There are so... look at, I have a whole wall of non subs, this is actually really heartbreaking

If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. yobtih  is probably a mod in here and he is the one that banned me.

[8:09:12] <StormbornVal> The resiliency of the human body to live without nourishment is impressive, considering that your glucose(sugar) reserves‚Äîwhat your body normally uses as its main source of energy‚Äîare exhausted within one day of not eating. After a day without food, your body releases a hormone called glucagon, which stimulates the liver to make glucose(a process called gluconeogenesis).

[8:13:27] <mataza94> HOW DO YOU THINK ZONIC FOUND IT OUT
[8:13:28] <weeeegy> especially when
[8:13:29] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m astralis gives spirit the round  so its not 11-4
[8:13:30] <StormbornVal> NOPERS zonic's law prayge
[8:13:30] <mataza94> ON HIS OWN SKIN
[8:13:31] <DavieWhy> Feel like it gets a booost
[8:13:32] <pedeso> it especially comes into effect
[8:13:32] <SpecterBoi24> its zonic law 2x
[8:13:32] <arcwarden_> of course
[8:13:33] <BizarreMark> monkaHmm
[8:13:33] <yobtih> if it crits it's a multiplyer
[8:13:33] <barnumbirr> zonic's law is above all other laws
[8:13:34] <GreavenTV> If it goes to 11-4 Astralis lose, 10-5 they win
[8:13:34] <vent_diver> ZONIC HIMSELF NEGATES HIS LAW OBVIOUSLY
[8:13:34] <Demonara> YEP it multiplies when he is in game @fl0m
[8:13:34] <StormbornVal> Prayge
[8:13:35] <n0r13k> @fl0m can you please explain to me zonics law please. I've not heard about it before, it's rarely mentioned.
[8:13:35] <GreavenTV> NODDERS
[8:13:35] <inzert15> Even he cant mitigate the effect
[8:13:39] <Destructoid5858> If Spirit loses this round it's over for Astralis
[8:13:39] <EchoCordis> zonic told them to throw the round so its 10-5 KEKW
[8:13:39] <carboxylate1> NOPERS its like PEMDAS or something
[8:13:40] <steven_Chinn> This game is already over, Spirit wins Major
[8:13:41] <dr_theory> He counteracts
[8:13:43] <BizarreMark> KEKW
[8:13:43] <marcus7445> Pretty sure zonic is the counter to zonics law
[8:13:44] <sgpamaar> astralis must lose this round
[8:13:45] <silvernade> KEKW

[8:14:13] <n0r13k> @sjoerdtheman sain?
[8:14:13] <vinciCS> zonic made a good call here, he knows that 11 - 4 is cursed so he told them to throw

[8:14:33] <sombersingularity> you see fl0m, zonic zonic law= zonic¬≤ law, and all real squared numbers are positive, so therefore the negative zonics law does indeed get counteracted by zonic being on the team 5Head

[9:03:16] <yaJgnizamA> can see heroic going 0-3 honestly
[9:03:18] <ekstraLUV> furiaaaaa
[9:03:22] <TheShoeMoney> DONT BET AGAINST brOBO
[9:03:22] <majkah_> ASTRALIS 0-3
[9:03:22] <LowRatedHighlander> Maybe entropiq
[9:03:25] <bosko70> G2 0-3
[9:03:25] <jayrajb> no gambit
[9:03:26] <morphgojo> liquid 3-0?
[9:03:27] <sjoerdtheman> peepoW astralis
[9:03:29] <Phantom410> Fucking bo1s make 0-3 so hard
[9:03:35] <WookiePotamus> astralis gunna pull a 2018 C9 KEKW
[9:03:35] <milanchauhan> faze up
[9:03:35] <JackAH> entropiq beats eg
[9:03:36] <apoodle10> heroic > astralis
[9:03:37] <Phantom410> EG can easly beat faze on one map
[9:03:37] <LowRatedHighlander> G2 I feel like will randomly pop off
[9:03:38] <McBubba03> FUCK ASTRALIS ARE GOING THROUGH MAN, ITS CURSED MAJORS ARE CURSED
[9:03:38] <tavez_> Faze go through
[9:03:39] <FriedRalion> LAN Furia Sadge
[9:03:39] <Gumberino> faze are looking good
[9:03:40] <quizhat> g2
[9:03:41] <ChosenDew> all the games are stage games
[9:03:42] <florianpln> im actually thinkin to put G2 in going through or just gamble 0-3
[9:03:42] <LowRatedHighlander> But won‚Äôt advanceb
[9:03:43] <Avozero> faze
[9:03:43] <TheFatDemon> OMG is this an Official English Co-Stream????
[9:03:44] <V1ZzxX> i am telling you liquid faze will happen for sure so 30 both is risky
[9:03:45] <KNAPKINAT0R> G2 0-3 100%
[9:03:47] <apoodle10> flames > astralis even
[9:03:49] <Skymin96> I'm going Faze 3-0 again
[9:03:50] <majkah_> Navi 3-1
[9:03:51] <jebby__> @fl0m check the bracket simulator https://major.ieb.im/21stockholm

[9:04:18] <Luigistarx> or is navi 100% going through PauseFish
[9:04:21] <cloutburstgg> navi as 3-0 for sure
[9:04:21] <EmimiXIV> ballsy
[9:04:25] <SupraUK_> i put VP 3-0 because i'm not risking that shit
[9:04:25] <Reb0rnOfficial> @fl0m MOUZ0-3 UZ

[9:04:31] <its_skippr> fl0m haven't watched CS matches for a while but is NIP really that good?
[9:04:32] <DesiXD> Copenhegan 3-0 KEKW
[9:04:32] <Lordwen> What about Heroic 3-0? @fl0m
[9:04:33] <lavavex> Faze is vs EG first round
[9:04:33] <GeorgeTAshes> mou might just loose

[9:04:36] <karNA_69> anyone got tokens??
[9:04:36] <gingeyhere> copenhagen 3-0?
[9:04:38] <DavieWhy> EG 3-0 for sure
[9:04:39] <tavez_> Faze might 3-1, I dont think 3-0. Your best but crazy bet is NiP 3-0
[9:04:39] <Archit47> I put gambit 3-0
[9:04:44] <WekePeke> for the ones who dont know Furia lineup: arT, yuurih, VINI, KSCERATO, drop
[9:04:48] <silenzi_oh> mouz 0-3?
[9:04:54] <ChosenDew> @KNAPKINAT0R navi could be cold and lose a bo1
[9:04:54] <zThrice> Has the achievment updated for anyone?
[9:04:56] <apoodle10> heroic will struggle a bit, i wouldnt pick em for 1 - 0
[9:04:58] <minded_> faze either goes 1-2 or 3-0
[9:04:59] <apoodle10> 3 - 0 i mean
[9:05:03] <zoccdawn> it's much harder than previous stage. (coming from someone that had two diamond coins in 2019 Kappa )

[9:05:19] <jaawglaary> i think astralis will go 3-0 because of the momentum
[9:05:19] <cloutburstgg> navi 3-0 and furia 0-3... liquid, faze, gambit, nip, vitality, g2, astralis for me

[9:06:55] <silver_eyes_tempest9> im putting heroic 0-3
[9:06:55] <DevilJack> gambit onliners pass it on chat
[9:07:00] <jebby__> they played godsent, mouz, and big. not exactly the same caliber of opponents
[9:07:01] <tavez_> G2 is literally 50/50 on any given tourney
[9:07:02] <TacticalAlmonds> @fl0m at what point does experience start playing a bigger factor? Ence hasn't had anyone on the big stage
[9:07:02] <sjoerdtheman> batsbanaan_ monkaGIGA

[9:07:13] <M3n0H> it's the niko shoq
[9:07:15] <JustVinny_> They are so incosistant
[9:07:15] <KNAPKINAT0R> the way simple and Navi have been playing they get 3-0 and G2 go 0-3 quote me
[9:07:15] <JakestersLab> I think copenhagen does it
[9:07:16] <jaawglaary> astralis will go to playoffs
[9:07:17] <mdrdGaming> still bo1 then bo3?

[9:08:01] <Nightbot> Joris says 97%

[9:08:37] <ANZ007_> EG or Mouz
[9:08:38] <real_ga7axy> @fl0m EZ4ENCE
[9:08:39] <Tvjuli> @fl0m I would pu gambit 3-0
[9:08:40] <LowRatedHighlander> flames looked strong but idk
[9:08:40] <muddychor> only reason y c9 not playing , s1mple not winning major , refrehz 1v5 clutch , coldzera jumping awp is due to g2 supporters
[9:08:41] <izab3ru> Gambit 0-3
[9:08:41] <Scape000> furia 0-3
[9:08:42] <cyxxm> EG*
[9:08:43] <BLAZE_raZERR> @LowRatedHighlander okay bro they r not in form so... i think they will choke or which im a faze fan boy they may choke too...
[9:08:45] <mindgobl1n> vitality 3-0
[9:08:45] <naelandraa> People still supporting KennyS to be in G2 Line up WutFace ... He s done. Playing Valorant all day long now.
[9:08:48] <vontaro0> yee it feels like michu/obo can pop off in one of those games
[9:08:48] <not_ian> you aren't a real NA stan if you don't put EG 3-0
[9:08:49] <kevinye18> FURIA 3-0
[9:08:51] <1_DC> Same
[9:08:51] <tavez_> Gambit or NiP 3-0 is a good bet because of Bo1s @fl0m
[9:08:53] <SquiDI0> honestly Furia or Mouz 0-3 i think
[9:08:56] <mukulhayaran> liquid 3-0
[9:08:56] <badabadabadabadabadabada> vitality 3-0 mouz 0-3
[9:08:56] <luca__stefan> Gambit MAKE OR BREAK type of team
[9:09:00] <nahopih> @fl0m copenhagen 3-0 100%
[9:09:01] <Caesaristaken_> i think faze
[9:09:02] <jebby__> @fl0m if EG lose to faze, and astralis lose to furia, they have a high chance of facing each other next round
[9:09:04] <rookiegangsta> gammbit= onliners
[9:09:07] <jamejacobs> Don't its lan
[9:09:08] <tan_clips> liquid 3-0 ez for na
[9:09:09] <depressed1_guy> put liquid in 3-0
[9:09:11] <random_factz> Faze 3-0 LETSGO
[9:09:12] <KNAPKINAT0R> GTR sabotaging flomies picks
[9:09:12] <kevinye18> @fl0m FURIA hot in BO1
[9:09:12] <izab3ru> Entropiq through
[9:09:13] <NebChilly> remeber online EG no way they go 0-3
[9:09:15] <dobby_shanker> who you got winning fl0m?
[9:09:18] <LowRatedHighlander> Gambit 0-3 if you‚Äôre high on meth
[9:09:22] <Skymin96> Torn between mouz and EG 0-3
[9:09:23] <C4ssieDYsk> mouz 3-0 copium
[9:09:29] <AFugy> G2 is coming off a win tho
[9:09:29] <Lordwen> @LowRatedHighlander +1 lmao
[9:09:30] <SkrubXela> Faze, Liquid, NIP, NAVI, Vat., Gambit, CopeFlames, VP.
[9:09:31] <deepfriedpogdog> Gambit won't go 3-0, it's harder to cheat on lan
[9:09:33] <EINacho> faze gotta make it through
[9:09:35] <Demonara> navi 0-3 COPIUM KEKWiggle
[9:09:35] <thurayshwe> Haven‚Äôt been following csgo for like a year but I am back and let‚Äôs gooooo Navi
[9:09:37] <LucidR9> chat you dont put a team that are amazing in 3-0 you put them in going through cause those are guaranteed points
[9:09:37] <caguirre18> I think mouz goes 0-3
[9:09:37] <yaJgnizamA> liquid 0-3 to cancel out the caster curse
[9:09:38] <johnnygazer> EG 0-3
[9:09:38] <bodybeefy> is it still possible to get the diamond coin if i missed the first pickems?
[9:09:39] <Ex0d1c> Will astralis will do a cloud9 like eleauge. They was 0-2 then 3-2 and the major KEKW KEKW KEKW KEKW KEKW
[9:09:39] <E_x3CuTioN3R> Did you complete your challenge to get coin?

[9:09:59] <VashTS1> faze go through imo
[9:09:59] <SkrubXela> Faze, Liquid, NIP, NAVI, Vat., Gambit, CopeFlames, VP?
[9:10:00] <LowRatedHighlander> I think flames is a decent 3-0 pick because they face g2 first
[9:10:00] <Skymin96> You feel better about liquid than faze?
[9:10:02] <Spiffypal> copenhagen goes thru

[9:11:53] <mgod270> why did you guys not just watch astralis play how you gonna say 3-0 ez
[9:11:54] <LowRatedHighlander> Astralis 3-0 is even higher on meth than putting them there in challengers KEKW

[9:12:12] <LucidR9> I think faze are the 3-0 pick personally
[9:12:12] <biffkaka97> eg 0-3
[9:12:12] <seamus_souleater> remember you want your dark horses at 3-0 so that you guarantee your bottom 7
[9:12:13] <Reb0rnOfficial> @fl0m my gut is telling me VP 0-3 for some reason
[9:12:13] <rsngrampa> eg-mozz 0-3
[9:12:13] <NoTrip_> Flames 3-0
[9:12:14] <somedayfps> @fl0m believe me. 0-3 MOUZ

[9:12:21] <V1ZzxX> what about furia @fl0m
[9:12:22] <NibletTide> pick your 0-3 first
[9:12:23] <alexwhelanjj> does your 3-0 also count if they go through 2-1??
[9:12:23] <Aderu__> just put 7 teams that you basically know that will advance, dont worry about 3-0 and 0.3
[9:12:24] <art_fanboy> astralis played better than heroic today
[9:12:25] <jamejacobs> MOUZ 0 - 3
[9:12:25] <ekstraLUV> do you think Nip should be there though? really? @fl0m
[9:12:25] <skreeeeeek> MOUZ 0 - 3

[9:12:48] <theHovnival> I can't doubt glaive
[9:12:48] <Jaseto88> fl0m need to think of players who would crack under pressure on LAN
[9:12:49] <GeorgeTAshes> no flames
[9:12:49] <EINacho> picking astralis is a hard gamble tbh, I am still gonna do it though
[9:12:50] <tavez_> yeah but Ancient is a really good map for brazil scene
[9:12:50] <Reb0rnOfficial> @fl0m my gut is telling me VP 0-3 for some reason
[9:12:50] <LowRatedHighlander> Just not consistently amazing

[9:12:56] <muddychor> if u think u r my dad , eu is bad
[9:12:57] <CortanaLXIX> i feel like putting heroic or astralis as 3-0 just for a gamble
[9:12:58] <TheycallmeTox> But they need to enable lucky somehow, otherwise they have no awper
[9:13:00] <xhomas22> WHAT ABOUT FURIA

[9:15:01] <Kurintoi> Is VP not looking good?
[9:15:01] <Xestty> so ence over vp you think?
[9:15:02] <hunter_ak17> eg

[9:15:04] <Scape000> eg go 0-3
[9:15:04] <Diaz1> NIP 3-0
[9:15:04] <Reb0rnOfficial> @fl0m VITALITY 0-3
[9:15:05] <LucidR9> genuinely think heroic could go 0-3
[9:15:05] <yobtih> EG is going to beat FaZe, it's a Bo1
[9:15:05] <Nightbot> fl0m and GeT_RiGhT now have partnered costream rights with no delay watching the main stream. https://twitter.com/pglesports/status/1454063718229319683
[9:15:06] <visiblescout> Heroic 0-3
[9:15:11] <Gacho> i really like the CIS teams. so im up for entropiq or vp
[9:15:13] <LowRatedHighlander> That‚Äôs fair
[9:15:13] <zorroo__> Teams that played the first phase have a better pace
[9:15:14] <setharoni_cs> mine does too @JakestersLab
[9:15:17] <vg_basicsnooze> 0-3 EG MAYBE
[9:15:18] <LowRatedHighlander> Bo1s are crazy
[9:15:19] <Spluad> @JakestersLab mine does still so I think it might just be the game for now
[9:15:20] <zorroo__> They hit the ground running
[9:15:20] <harrrrsh> eg going 0-3?
[9:15:22] <draxler077> @yobtih COPIUM TRUE
[9:15:22] <Dynamo_Dave> FL0m you know everyone is waiting for you to pick so we know who to avoid. you're curses have been on point
[9:15:23] <Ulcha> This pickem is so tough, not becuase every team is super strong rn but because literally every team has been shaky enough that they could fail horribly LUL
[9:15:23] <yobtih> Bo1's EG can win
[9:15:23] <Zeyzo_> monkaHmm my chalenges havent updated
[9:15:27] <ThePooP> this is it chat
[9:15:27] <muddychor> navi pls lose and make the major exciting
[9:15:27] <AnnoyinMercenary> @fl0m check your major coin challenges
[9:15:28] <Speedrulez> i think you are making a mistake by gambit 3-0 i think they will lose a map. id do someone like VP fl0m
[9:15:28] <ThePooP> https://prnt.sc/1xqrw3k
[9:15:28] <NxHLucky> does everyone's coin nont update
[9:15:31] <batsbanaan_> I will get 50 if eg wins against faze
[9:15:33] <JakestersLab> oh good, thought i had fucked it up KEKW
[9:15:34] <Jadennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> @fl0m If I want to get into ESports, which team should I support? How do I decide
[9:15:34] <djscillz> fl0m do you have fpsmax 1000 in menus?
[9:15:36] <yobtih> I actually think LAN Cerq shows up
[9:15:37] <bzzbbzzb9> 0-3pick EG
[9:15:38] <priiide_> fl0m you think we're gonna see a bunch of nuke bo1s again?
[9:15:39] <Ex0d1c> bo1 first day just to know
[9:15:39] <E_x3CuTioN3R> I completed challenges still did not get any coin! The challenges are still showing pending
[9:15:41] <1_DC> Egs mappool is straight up garbo
[9:15:42] <PyotoruX> KICK ENCE
[9:15:44] <frostyfawxy> diamond coin is gonna be tough this season
[9:15:48] <Spluad> it'll get sorted
[9:15:50] <bzr7> I'm scared of picking liquid they choke so muck :(
[9:15:50] <ZNE_Live> Liquid 3-0 / Mouz 0-3 for me tbh
[9:15:51] <seamus_souleater> @fl0m put gambit on advance row and put a dark horse on 3-0 like CPF or VP
[9:15:52] <mukulhayaran> %? 69
[9:15:52] <Nightbot> Joris says 62%
[9:15:54] <zThrice> chat. EG has to beat Faze in first game
[9:15:56] <mukulhayaran> !1deag
[9:15:56] <praeter15> fl0m EG 3-0 peepoSit
[9:15:56] <Nightbot> mukulhayaran pops a 1deag on havikri 1TAP
[9:15:56] <WysTaaN> @ZNE_Live Kappa
[9:15:57] <Jaseto88> Mouz could easily go 0-2 after the Bo1s, then Frozen and Acor could crack under the pressure in the 3rd game
[9:15:58] <Speedrulez> i think you are making a mistake by gambit 3-0 i think they will lose a map. id do someone like VP fl0m
[9:15:59] <zThrice> keep that in mind
[9:16:00] <Spiffypal> bro where's og
[9:16:01] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[9:16:02] <mukulhayaran> fl0m EG 3-0 peepoSit
[9:16:05] <puplice> why not Copenhagen?
[9:16:07] <euECHO> @fl0m could be nerves for EG as this will be their first LAN back from the pandemic
[9:16:07] <OGWerp> EG is 0-3, this is the hardest thing ive had to do in my life Sadge
[9:16:07] <xhomas22> Mouz 0-3 100%
[9:16:08] <Aderu__> is 2nd round also bo1?
[9:16:09] <Agaroth788> Too much Jame time VP 0-3 Ez for ence 3-0 fl0mCozy
[9:16:09] <Huwaidee> CH flames beat 3 big teams to qualify so they can be a good shout no ?
[9:16:10] <im2meta4u> how's your stream been today bb fl0mHeart was at work all day so I missed it, hope you're doing well
[9:16:13] <TyphloMusic> why gambit 3-0?
[9:16:17] <M3n0H> eg dont beat faze
[9:16:17] <vg_basicsnooze> EG IS PROB THE WORST TEAM HERE MAYBE 0-3
[9:16:19] <V1ZzxX> because fl0m after entropiq loses to liquid they mostly play eg or cph both are better teams and then they play a good team that ost so 0-3 is best for entropiq
[9:16:20] <real_ga7axy> EZ4ENCE
[9:16:23] <Kurintoi> !twitter
[9:16:24] <Nightbot> https://twitter.com/fl0mtv

[9:16:27] <inigof12> shits so stacked its so difficult
[9:16:28] <whyimserious_> they look solid
[9:16:28] <SoporificPanda> not putting liquid or eg as the 3-0 fake NA fan

[9:17:14] <yobtih> Bo1 Astralis
[9:17:14] <somedayfps> ASTRALIS , MOUZ , EG = 0-3
[9:17:16] <dientesrotos> furia its gonna make it
[9:17:16] <ali_kei> Mouz 0-3 100%
[9:17:16] <brotherman2222> Heroic 3-0? They look terrible
[9:17:18] <aka_woods> IS EG not the easy 0-3?
[9:17:19] <depressed1_guy> put some respect for g2 man
[9:17:20] <ebicman67> EG 0-3 for sure
[9:17:20] <yaJgnizamA> im not sold on mouz tbh
[9:17:20] <isaaax> online makes this difficult
[9:17:20] <d4nger911> ofc EG 0-3

[9:17:25] <truck_kunn> G2?
[9:17:27] <TH0R_95> @nousn0u naaah, it's EG's place KEKW
[9:17:27] <kooshyy> @fl0m u still got virtus pro bro
[9:17:27] <M3n0H> i think astralis can beat furia
[9:17:28] <stoicmasochist> how have you not put VP in the qualified teams
[9:17:28] <Romit_Kanabar> G2
[9:17:32] <silenzi_oh> Who is going 1-3 in the legend stage?
[9:17:32] <RazrRaiden> G2
[9:17:32] <V1ZzxX> easy 0-3 entropiq
[9:17:33] <Xestty> if astralis  plays like they did today they will win one
[9:17:35] <hobrev> out of all these, with a huge regency bias, I would put entropiq going thru
[9:17:35] <Cake315> suprauk_ nah im to busy
[9:17:37] <HaZeCandy> EG or MOUZ 0-3
[9:17:37] <mataza94> im just a die hard eg fan but they also 0-3 i cant see a world where they win a bo3
[9:17:38] <Jaseto88> EG could go 0-3 easily. Spirit of the team and motivation will be important
[9:17:40] <RyoGTO> Mine is the same I have FaZe 3-0 though
[9:17:40] <1_DC> Im torn between eg, mouz and furia for 0-3
[9:17:40] <lakesidegameing> ya no way EG win a game.
[9:17:41] <yaJgnizamA> G2 is my 0-3
[9:17:41] <krane151> i put a coin in astralis 3-0 KEKW
[9:17:41] <tizmlane> I saw u on at 4am est before I went to bed and ur still on at 1pm est! I love it!
[9:17:43] <GreavenTV> I'd go for either EG, Mouz or Furia as 0-3
[9:17:44] <WookiePotamus> Flames has had a couple of Days to prepare for this stage too
[9:17:44] <viking_mercenary> @fl0m do u think liquid will make it or its COPIUM
[9:17:44] <bosko70> i got G2 0-3
[9:17:50] <le1chtx7> yeah exactly. I remember when NRG went 3-0 in challengers stage and then when they played the big dogs in the Legends stage they got 0-3'd at Katowice 2019
[9:17:50] <ANZ007_> Astralis has a good strats

[9:19:13] <Nightbot> fl0m‚Äôs guest is GeT_RiGhT
[9:19:13] <not_ian> EG goes 3-0 or 0-3 no inbetween
[9:19:13] <FlameyKumori> you want the guaranteed 5 teams first, the 3-0 and 0-3 slots are extras
[9:19:14] <Rei_J4> This why I wait to do mine, for daddy Fl0m's advice
[9:19:14] <rsngrampa> mouz or eg 0-3
[9:19:14] <ibunnydude2> I got timed for writing DIKS in chat but fl0m can say suck one on stream. I HATE IT HERE
[9:19:14] <ali_kei> maybe furia 3-0 then
[9:19:15] <Semiproshark7> Put Navi 3-0 ez dubs
[9:19:16] <krane151> KEKW
[9:19:18] <Morde24> mouz 0-3 bc faze might lose to EG
[9:19:18] <Bettegette> Dude they play flames
[9:19:18] <tdjd55> liquid-vitality and ence gonna bust
[9:19:19] <sevixxxxxx> imo ibuypower win
[9:19:20] <Lmsz> i think i'll stick with CPH in 3-0, since it worked well. :D
[9:19:20] <YungLeonTV> Astralis in the 3-0?
[9:19:20] <sevixxxxxx> major
[9:19:22] <thegunarse> @atiikaaa ??
[9:19:22] <LowRatedHighlander> Joris is NA fan confirmed NODDERS
[9:19:22] <lavavex> I put Mythic 3-0
[9:19:22] <Nightbot> fl0mSHOOK
[9:19:22] <V1ZzxX> dude best teams without astralis sounds sus @fl0m
[9:19:24] <tumaatti> astralis to 3-0 since they are hard to predict 5Head
[9:19:25] <xhomas22> Yeah actually true, teams that advance arent lucky, they are consistenly good but could be unlucky with a game @fl0m
[9:19:25] <orphansquirel> id never bet on a team with niko to lose 2 back to back bo1's
[9:19:26] <kevinye18> @fl0m If FAZE get out of this stage, they winning major no cap
[9:19:26] <DavieWhy> @LowRatedHighlander monkaW
[9:19:27] <ImXun> KEKW
[9:19:27] <DJ_Crocs> is there a schedule out for matches tomorrow to look at?
[9:19:27] <crazytzefyr> Waaatttt G2 ain‚Äôt gonna go 3-0
[9:19:30] <Nomad182> na fanboy I'm picking eg to go through COPIUM
[9:19:31] <ItsmeOwen_tv> @fl0m why ence over CF?
[9:19:31] <random_factz> Faze  3-0 LETSGO
[9:19:31] <ThresherXG> its an odds game people, not who is right
[9:19:32] <MagmaFalcon55> @fl0m what do you think of maybe FaZe 3-0?
[9:19:32] <bladeDK87> Go CPH Flames 3-0
[9:19:35] <SmattsPlays> @fl0m Astralis 3-0
[9:19:35] <vinciCS> the people who are saying WTF also didnt put Faze or Flames as 3-0
[9:19:36] <aka_woods> Only difference is Gambit not going through. Nice picks Daddy
[9:19:36] <Semiproshark7> But if u get the top right, it‚Äôs easy dubs
[9:19:37] <viking_mercenary> %? 59
[9:19:37] <Nightbot> Joris says 78%
[9:19:37] <arAEdeN> one of the first to go 3-0 is usually a one-off
[9:19:38] <bruhandon46> If its hard then Im hard cause i got the faze 3-0
[9:19:38] <edgyeddy233> then put liquid
[9:19:38] <tan_clips> so tough
[9:19:38] <Kurintoi> why no one got VP at the bottom?
[9:19:38] <DevilJack> Astralis 0 - 3
[9:19:39] <stoicmasochist> put VP in
[9:19:40] <RyoGTO> Ahhhh ty for that
[9:19:40] <twitchverticle> entropiq 0-3 100 percent @fl0m
[9:19:44] <volumefx_> ence over heroric ? yikes
[9:19:44] <tac0tek> ence??? really
[9:19:44] <Moobot> Please ask a mod before posting links. (@maher320s) (warning)
[9:19:44] <chiggins4424> how many points do u need?
[9:19:45] <ChosenDew> flames 3-0
[9:19:45] <RyoGTO> great strat
[9:19:46] <WekePeke> crazytzefyr thats the point
[9:19:46] <yooperJM> More confident that Flames got 3-0 than G2 going 3-0
[9:19:47] <GreavenTV> Not sure what you're impying here, I put the Flames in 3-0 last stage because they were clearly the favourites
[9:19:48] <YungLeonTV> @fl0m Astralis 3-0?
[9:19:48] <arAEdeN> like CPH Flames
[9:19:48] <vrajio> why not mouz for 3-0 @fl0m
[9:19:48] <aka_woods> Astralis makes it
[9:19:55] <yaJgnizamA> https://i.imgur.com/yBaWKEd.png
[9:19:56] <truck_kunn> flames then?
[9:19:57] <yaJgnizamA> thats what i put
[9:20:00] <brotherman2222> EG 0-3 obviously
[9:20:01] <asprin801> reasonable,  since Gambit should make playoffs
[9:20:01] <Morde24> Entropiq is not going through
[9:20:02] <Aderu__> but entropiq doesnt win liquid
[9:20:04] <V1ZzxX> what
[9:20:04] <vietxican22> Fr cph 3-0
[9:20:04] <dirtd_> It‚Äôs called hedging
[9:20:05] <maher320s> @DJ_Crocs Yes, go to HLTV and look at the matches
[9:20:06] <Nightbot> fl0m and GeT_RiGhT now have partnered costream rights with no delay watching the main stream. https://twitter.com/pglesports/status/1454063718229319683
[9:20:06] <lakesidegameing> I'd take heroic over vitality
[9:20:07] <ebicman67> feeling flames 3-0
[9:20:08] <marcinh778> eg 03
[9:20:08] <alexb_> Was it a mistake for me to install Windows 11? Cause CS is already so poorly optimized for Windows 10.
[9:20:09] <wini_bruhh> @fl0m what about heroic 3-0
[9:20:10] <marcinh778> imp
[9:20:11] <Punisher2004> EG 0-3 BET!
[9:20:11] <marcinh778> imo
[9:20:11] <tdjd55> imagine if flamez goes 3-0 again
[9:20:12] <im2meta4u> fl0m you don't see VP going through instead of ENCE?
[9:20:12] <ZNE_Live> Liquid 3-0 bro, my gut man

[9:45:11] <Uwotm08> Valve thinks CS:GO is a game of five players in a server against five other players in that server. They're correct.

[9:45:11] <AIR02000> dont jinx navi dad
[9:45:15] <yobtih> Valve is that Girlfriend that got cheated on a lot and then they saw you liking other girls insta posts and so you have to sleep on the couch now

[9:46:48] <iminconfusion_101> You guys do know that all match-ups change dramatically when you go BO3
[9:46:48] <uteslesi> astralis would go through
[9:46:49] <yaJgnizamA> so they are pretty hot
[9:46:50] <House_King> ence 3-0 ez4ence
[9:46:56] <crazytzefyr> try the csgo major matchup simulator
[9:46:57] <jaaaaaaamin> no way cph go 3-0 twice in a row right? unless

[9:49:40] <wlnnie_> @fr33ze_02 if there is an upset then you dont have them going through. You want to put teams that might go through in 3 0 but teams on the bottom that have a high chance of going through no matter what
[9:49:40] <TSkrup> is international team that good
[9:49:40] <JHdash77> @xhomas22 G2

[9:53:58] <2caves> @fl0m it's a seeding simulator, you can change results
[9:53:58] <Chruse_> If NaVi wins their first game and CPH wins their first, they will play eachother. Is Flames really gonna beat NaVi?
[9:53:59] <JHdash77> @fl0m bro the website isn't there to predict matches
[9:53:59] <SupraUK_> and it adjusts
[9:54:00] <godzboi> It's randomized, not stats based
[9:54:01] <scarebard> @splitsky_ its just that some teams might be lucky and get through
[9:54:02] <LucidR9> nah 100% correct Furia to win major Brazil dynasty reestablished

[9:55:28] <EINacho> I have furia eg 0-3
[9:55:31] <HkuzACS> @MrTanki44 statistically you have better odds in the advanced option and the chances of a team going 3-0 is a low chance x
[9:55:31] <sm0gless> COPIUM
[9:55:34] <2caves> it's not predictions @fl0m it's seeding, you can choose anyone

[9:55:48] <bohmander_> mouz 1-3
[9:55:51] <E_x3CuTioN3R> Who do you think is better in BO3s? AST or ENCE?
[9:55:52] <xhomas22> Put astralis as 3-0 and u got it perfect
[9:55:54] <ExerpasCSGO> %? Copenhagen flames going 3-0
[9:55:54] <Nightbot> Joris says 80%
[9:55:56] <marv02_> but i think G2 will make into the next rounds so where to put G2?
[9:55:57] <WholesomeTyler> @fl0m did your completed challenges update?
[9:55:57] <brotherman2222> Its not a predictor it shows you what matchups will occur based on your own predictions
[9:55:57] <1_DC> Watch ropz pop off in a bo3
[9:55:57] <ilyBeamic> @fl0m just click each team logo for each round then it calculates the matchups for the next round.
[9:55:58] <Blinddlol> did you get updated coin yet? @fl0m
[9:55:58] <KPC51> it's hard not to have EG 0-3 tho
[9:55:59] <karNA_69> u can select
[9:56:00] <mighty_nyorai> PGL send the script plz
[9:56:01] <real_ga7axy> VP 0-3
[9:56:02] <FarmorFattima> Should i have astralis on 0-3 or should i change ??
[9:56:03] <mrrriics> did mose  won or big
[9:56:04] <tyronejnr_> why mouz on 0 - 3
[9:56:05] <JHdash77> @fl0m the website is for seeing who plays against who, by choosing the winners yourself
[9:56:06] <beastgamer004> Liquid 3-0
[9:56:08] <ekstraLUV> @fl0m how about nip 3-0? that should settle the bottom row
[9:56:10] <Uwotm08> That linked simulator works off of ranking and is mostly useless since it ranks FURIA #2 higher than Astralis #15.
[9:56:11] <boyc3_> EG Advancing 3-2?????????
[9:56:14] <LucidR9> wtf are hltv forums rn monkaS
[9:56:14] <maher320s> This is so hard.  Picked 8 teams to advance andleft off G2, VP, Heroic, and Astralis!!!
[9:56:14] <mukulhayaran> no way mouz goes 3-0 , ropz can carry at least one bo3 on his own COPIUM
[9:56:15] <boyc3_> hello????

[9:56:34] <vice99669> @secretlord29 HLTV
[9:56:35] <FarmorFattima> Put entropiq on teams that Will advance
[9:56:35] <E_x3CuTioN3R> Who do you think is better in BO3s? AST or ENCE?
[9:56:36] <tyronejnr_> why mouz on 0 - 3
[9:56:36] <pear_sounds> @suspectu000 7/9
[9:56:41] <luckinout1> The further Astralis go, the more worried i get
[9:56:44] <HowdyGamerz> the sim also says entropiq>navi so idk
[9:56:47] <sfx31201> can you show us who you got winning each match
[9:56:49] <Uwotm08> @brotherman2222 Yes and it's useless since NA #2 is not as good as EU #2
[9:56:51] <ilyBeamic> @suspectu000 7 of 9
[9:56:53] <InflatableTuna> heroic over liquid for sure
[9:56:54] <Officialwheezy> what was the link?

[10:01:04] <jun0117_> ENCE has a crazy dust 2
[10:01:09] <basedjumper> I think Ence beats Gambit
[10:01:11] <seamus_souleater> I think ENCE can beat gambit but idk
[10:01:12] <yobtih> ?
[10:01:14] <HaZeCandy> how are games decided on who plays who?

[10:01:15] <gusis13> Gambit will win
[10:01:16] <SupraUK_> picky MS
[10:01:18] <itzGeez> picky ms :)
[10:01:19] <mukulhayaran> KEKW
[10:01:20] <KPC51> "only did bad online" aka the entirety of the last two years?
[10:01:21] <goonie1986> Navi win the whole thing
[10:01:21] <jun0117_> this is BO1 so I think ENCE @fl0m
[10:01:23] <mariooogames> this is literally useless, after 1 different result the whole thing doesn't have any benefits
[10:01:25] <dec0dep> !1deag
[10:01:25] <Nightbot> dec0dep pops a 1deag on fraginwagon 1TAP
[10:01:26] <1_DC> picky ms :)
[10:01:27] <GreenPhoenix044> even if mouz has a bad place rn. eg just dont look good

[10:01:30] <boyc3_> im stuck on NIP vs Heroic in a 2-2 game Sadge
[10:01:31] <mukulhayaran> picky ms :)
[10:01:38] <TheDojoe> mouz > furia in the 0-1
[10:01:39] <DevilofSafwa> if mouz loses and furia loses they play each other, you still think mouz will lose against them? @fl0m
[10:01:42] <seamus_souleater> WAIT??? They played well the past year but struggled online? Everything was online in the last year
[10:01:43] <CalmTiger> F
[10:01:43] <lastplacesmiling> .... and Jame with the save...
[10:01:44] <SupraUK_> @boyc3_ stuck? of course nip wins
[10:01:49] <BoftinRowswell> IDK shiro scares me that man is next simple
[10:01:51] <brotherman2222> Its a matchup calculator not a simulator
[10:01:52] <mgod270> @boyc3_ thats ez nip
[10:02:01] <SoporificPanda> oh wait CPH will play navi round 2 abort cph 3-0

[10:02:09] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[10:02:12] <goonie1986> VP is trash, just save every round until they lose
[10:02:14] <itsmelihas> when will crowd match start ?
[10:02:26] <boyc3_> G2 and EG going out 0-3 the kings of inconsistency
[10:02:27] <bohmander_> mouz 1-3
[10:02:31] <goonie1986> Jame is also playing bad lately
[10:02:33] <Uwotm08> Gotta say, this is a very nice website.
[10:02:35] <itzGeez> @itsmelihas I think champ stage
[10:02:37] <loversss> acor is so bad though
[10:02:38] <bohmander_> mouz wont go 0-3
[10:02:41] <KPC51> @boyc3_ g2 going 0-3 would be the opposite of inconsistency
[10:02:41] <dec0dep> !1deag
[10:02:41] <Nightbot> dec0dep pops a 1deag on azoreofinom 1TAP

[10:02:44] <Nightbot> Joris says 84%
[10:02:44] <real_ga7axy> @fl0m ENCE 3-0 EG 0-3
[10:02:46] <KPC51> gotta win every once in a while
[10:02:49] <iCatDad> ive never understoof why the first matches are BO1
[10:02:50] <bohmander_> EG 0-3
[10:02:50] <SupraUK_> surely mouz beats furia
[10:02:50] <Trashbait> furia smashs mouz, NA is #1
[10:02:54] <goonie1986> litterally no way mouz go 0-3
[10:02:55] <santideprimera> gambit > liquid 2nd round
[10:02:56] <beastgamer004> Everyone is doubting furia :d
[10:02:57] <itzGeez> I want to see astralis vs NiP

[10:03:28] <RyoGTO> Yeah it is crazy
[10:03:29] <bohmander_> EG 0-3 no need to think
[10:03:35] <wallmanm> This is far too much brain power for pickems
[10:03:38] <bluehipp0> you almost get the impression that sports gambling is a science more than gambling.... KEKW

[10:03:44] <puzz__> EG 0-3? @fl0m
[10:03:45] <td_gg> i think g2 0-3 pick is tronger than mouz
[10:03:47] <RyoGTO> It is good for knowing who is gonna play who tho during the matches
[10:03:49] <yobtih> Swiss is the best system
[10:03:54] <st9yde> EG also go 0-3
[10:03:54] <Darkagespawn> pepeMeltdown DinkDonk NotLikeThis

[10:04:15] <SupraUK_> so furia 0-3
[10:04:19] <vchair23> mouz should snack furia around idk man

[11:38:27] <Indoorguitar> @fl0m Strimmer I have lost many points to your bullshit "gambas", and I demand a refund as a citizen of the United State Of fl0m (Only one state because you aren't good enough for more). If you do not refund my "Gamba" points, know you are singlehandedly responsible for the death of my entire family because they all starved without our daily income
