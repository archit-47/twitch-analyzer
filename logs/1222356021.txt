I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
[1:17:47] <Doccy> i mean there are reasons why you should dislike valorant but none of them have to do with the gameplay
