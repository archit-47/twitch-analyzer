[0:21:02] <STatisfacti0n> shit I remember when fl0m was often in the money for Rank S
[0:21:03] <fr0stbb> Is there an entry tax or FaceIt provides the money
[0:21:04] <Crokpot57> is it MM lobbies?
[0:21:29] <The_Ganznoob> I member the rank S days... that was when I used to watch JasonR as well PepeLaugh
[0:21:32] <CrazyHarambe69> actually according to many that have left fpl they say that its a toxic community also full of cheaters, people play for money and it's extremely toxic

[0:22:14] <theBaboda> @Crokpot57 no, it's a third party match making system, which *insert what fl0m said earlier*

[2:07:44] <le_petit_phrog> ?????
[2:07:51] <fricks_lozf> no way murder is on the same level as that doccy
[2:07:53] <Sqwidders> otzHmm
[2:07:56] <LucidR9> what if pokeballs were originally just used to make prison cells
[2:08:01] <fr0stbb> Cooper is feeling it

[2:08:26] <le_petit_phrog> We went from the Lorax, to Pok√©mon, to execution, I must‚Äôve missed something
[2:08:27] <Doccy> @fricks_lozf i mean it's the same a slavery
[2:08:37] <LucidR9> Doccy it's not tho
[2:08:44] <Doccy> in fact slavery is worse than murder
[2:08:48] <LucidR9> it's stockholm syndrome
[2:08:48] <ohmygodthecolorpurpel> monkaS i've def missed something
[2:08:49] <SukksGaming> What if pokemon is a man made construct just to entertain kids (and adults with low IQ like me)
[2:08:51] <Doccy> i mean wtf do u think pokeballs are
[2:08:54] <LucidR9> you capture a pokemon, against its will
[2:08:58] <LucidR9> and you make it love you
[2:09:01] <bigb1058> pokeball's a just mini bdsm quaters
[2:09:04] <fricks_lozf> Doccy but friendship with pokemon through forced activites is better
[2:09:08] <black_lorax> viz has some nice aim
[2:09:09] <Doccy> and you have to beat it up first
[2:09:09] <DashX239> that depends on if you tame the pokemon or they are domesticated Doccy
[2:09:12] <le_petit_phrog> I mean slavery could be murder, if you work them too much

[2:12:15] <iVex> How come every time fl0m plays FPL, they go into OT and he only gets to play 1-2 games KEKWait
[2:12:21] <LucidR9> Evilgeo2 they do ask ate a magikarp in the show
[2:12:22] <Doccy> i mean don't pokeballs take the matter of a pokemon and turn it into energy to be stored
[2:12:24] <LucidR9> ash*
[2:12:26] <Ewy_Qwarp> !delay
[2:12:26] <Nightbot> there is a smol delay because FPL is super serious gaming time

[2:12:39] <Evilgeo2> @LucidR9 D:
[2:12:41] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKWait
[2:12:44] <Tvjuli> LucidR9 If you have god at your will in a pokeball does that make you a god?
[2:12:45] <LucidR9> Doccy so could you make a gun that just expends the energy of a pokemon as a cartridge
[2:12:55] <rinzinlol> rush b
[2:12:59] <DashX239> @Doccy if that's the case then it literally murders the pokemon and just makes a clone with the same memories
[2:13:01] <fr0stbb> OT?
[2:13:06] <Doccy> i mean it is stored digitally iirc
[2:13:06] <k3bbin> no way did you guys just throw an 11:4 half
[2:13:12] <k3bbin> i tuned out but im back
[2:13:13] <Doccy> that;s why you can transfer in a pc
[2:13:18] <Evilgeo2> guys I'm about to buy brilliant diamond bc I never beat diamond pearl or platinum as a kid Peepo
[2:13:18] <bigb1058> pokemon is in the pockets of big bdsm and that has been my ted talk
[2:13:18] <akss13> @mods OT poll!
[2:13:18] <LucidR9> can you hack a pokemon
[2:13:22] <LucidR9> to be your own pokemon
[2:13:23] <fricks_lozf> LucidR9 that would make magikarp useful for something
[2:13:27] <le_petit_phrog> @carboxylate1 I took one look at your name and I threw up, I just took an ochem test today and I got flashbacks
[2:13:27] <Doccy> yeah
[2:13:28] <Doccy> i mean
[2:13:32] <Doccy> that's why team rocket does
[2:13:34] <Sqwidders> transfer deez nuts otzHappy
[2:13:35] <Doccy> basically
[2:13:41] <TectonicAmmo> @sloveCS do you like to be knifed?
[2:13:42] <LucidR9> Doccy nah they try to steal the physical pokeballs
[2:13:43] <Doccy> what*
[2:13:48] <Sparkle_Pony> bye cooper
[2:13:54] <dims_cs> JMP OH MY
[2:13:57] <DashX239> I thought that was hard storage
[2:13:57] <carboxylate1> @le_petit_phrog ochem is inevitable peepoEvil
[2:13:59] <LucidR9> but surely you could just remotely take someone's pokemon without them knowing
[2:13:59] <Doccy> i mean u need the physical pokeball
[2:14:05] <LucidR9> well no
[2:14:11] <Evilgeo2> @LucidR9 wasn't it the gamecube games where the evil team tried to actually alter the dna of the pokemon to make them shadow pokemon or something?
[2:14:11] <carboxylate1> @le_petit_phrog but i hope you did well Prayge
[2:14:11] <Doccy> oh yeah u can do that
[2:14:13] <froster5226> PauseFish
[2:14:17] <Thugs_Bunny268> what is bsod?
[2:14:19] <Doccy> since they are stored on a server
[2:14:22] <LucidR9> if they can transfer them to pcs, surely you could just trick the pokeball into thinking your pc was the trainer's pc
[2:14:26] <Doccy> that bill has
[2:14:27] <LucidR9> and steal the pokemon
[2:14:31] <Zer0Dayz77> @Thugs_Bunny268 blue screen of death
