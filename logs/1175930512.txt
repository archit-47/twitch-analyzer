[1:24:29] <Doccy> i mean the story of far cry can lack in some places
[1:24:29] <le_petit_phrog> MY FBI GUY IS GONNA SCREAM I LOOKED THE AIM TRAINER ON YOUTUBE
[1:24:36] <Dynamo_Dave> I'm surprised there isn't a Los pollos hermanos mod yet
[1:24:52] <yourducky> true doccy
[1:25:00] <yourducky> but 3 was the best story imo
[1:25:18] <D1srvpts> NODDERS far cry 3 is one of my favorite stories told in a game
[1:25:18] <Nightbot> Latest video: How Practice in a CS:GO Team REALLY Works! - https://youtu.be/GHhpqhjTpf8
[1:25:32] <yourducky> Have I ever told you the definition of insanity
[1:25:35] <yourducky> yourduScared
[1:25:38] <Doccy> 3 is definitely great for story and game play
[1:25:47] <D1srvpts> gaupo ate that shit fl0mSwole
[1:25:48] <Doccy> i've heard 2 is pretty good for that as well
[1:26:02] <Doccy> never played 4 and don't know much about it
[1:26:04] <The_Shuck> guapo got gas man
[1:26:09] <The_Shuck> that thing MOVES
[1:26:11] <yourducky> I think you can get this game with the uplay sub right? thats what stormborn told me
[1:26:12] <Dynamo_Dave> I'm gonna have to play fc3 now. I own it but never got round to playing it (bought it for blood dragon)
[1:26:16] <yourducky> duckDance
[1:26:22] <D1srvpts> I played a metric fuck ton of 5 and I loved that game
[1:26:34] <Doccy> 2 of the 4 villains in far cry 5 had great story arcs
[1:26:38] <D1srvpts> monkaSTEER
[1:26:44] <yourducky> I played more of 5 after playing outlast 2 KEKW
[1:26:46] <GFYMeowMix> monkaSTEER
[1:26:55] <yourducky> I said it was payback for what they did to me in Outlast 2

[1:27:24] <Doccy> 5 @le_petit_phrog
[1:27:33] <yourducky> 5 was set in Montana
[1:27:35] <Doccy> the issue i have with far cry 5, is there is so much content bloat with the random events
[1:27:38] <yourducky> 4 was Tibet?
[1:27:38] <le_petit_phrog> Ah I watched some gameplay with it, it was pretty good

[1:35:27] <ImTarco> Wait did the fov tighten while you were swimming? Am I crazy?
[1:35:29] <Doccy> okay but did you read the book to know what to look for
[1:35:40] <D1srvpts> doccy you think they would do that?

[1:39:14] <Doccy> also fl0m enjoyed this game when the played before
[1:39:15] <octoshark191> @ImTarco I still understand what you mean; it definitely seems to get lower while they're swimming, but I'm sure whether that's because such actually lowers or it just seems that way.
[1:39:16] <ImTarco> Also CS bad gaem
