[3:45:13] <F1niteCS> I've just had an interesting observation. Whenever you play CS, I regularly have to refresh the stream because the video and audio keep desyncing.

[3:48:27] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker (ask katie). its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree
