[0:44:28] <Aallesklaarr> no way COLs problem is firepower apart from maybe junior
[0:44:28] <djimpopo> the firepower is nice, its just inconsistent imo

[0:45:26] <Dantes_Oni> obo literally left complexity cause he got homesick KEKW
[0:45:30] <cranidos_11> grim deserved better Sadge
[0:45:38] <svnlier> Sadge
[0:45:38] <Sem073> They talked about him at HLTV confimred last week and there were some personal stuff keeping him back
[0:45:41] <abildlund> @fl0m But there are 3 more or less New teams, and none of them could use him?
[0:45:41] <Tyler19CS> Junior is a good awper very inconsistent
[0:45:43] <chipper412> Been a fat min since I’ve been back in ur stream. . . I hate college 😂 😭 can’t play CS
[0:45:48] <Bopojoe_> any !DICKS in the chat
[0:45:48] <Aallesklaarr> obo > tim if so
[0:45:49] <Koi_CSGO_> obo's lack of a team is because of him and his mental health, not because he didn't have options
[0:45:50] <nnsLUL> RUSH looked fucking hot as well in group stages
[0:45:56] <XeeVzz> maybe instead of tim

[0:45:59] <oblivion0608> obo for autimatic?
[0:46:00] <mcWoodst3r> its probably good for col to get some online tier 1 practice instead of going directly to lan
[0:46:01] <EXT18xPatches> @fl0m is there no more extra salt?
[0:46:13] <mestari003> OBO pretty much needs to go EU
[0:46:20] <freddie_from_mercury> obo, makes me sad that he didn't get a team
[0:46:23] <bobby_deol> I really just want Cerq to leave EG
[0:46:24] <trash_vlr> obo instead of auti?
[0:46:25] <dolev801> i think its too early to call if moves were correct fl0m
[0:46:26] <Dantes_Oni> Rush holds teams together
[0:46:32] <bobby_deol> He has lost his touch
[0:46:35] <dotalegendery> thats a nice angle towards
[0:46:35] <GreenPhoenix044> Obo does deserve to be in a tier 1 team

[0:54:15] <GreenPhoenix044> Why does junior look like that when hes playing? He is so stressed out
[0:54:18] <nblumberg> Replace S1mple with Obo and Navi fixes their slow start. EZ
[0:54:33] <vinciCS> junior's positioning just always feels off, maybe less now then before but he always seems to get caught off position wise
[0:54:36] <mimomomo1> !gears
[0:54:40] <Exedra711> yeah its like you dont get to shoot
[0:54:42] <Sjoesnov> Lack of confidence against better opponents?

[0:54:59] <jelbert_uwu> could be a mental thing for junior

[0:55:10] <sean6993> @nblumberg nah, monesy buy back for simple and obo for bit bro
[0:55:12] <valar1003> worse positioning or getting flashed and shit by a good enemy team

[0:55:39] <Bopojoe_> first game, its fine
[0:55:40] <crazedwolf911> @dinkydeckerz awping 1v1 is a bad way to test if anyone is better just luck mostly
[0:55:43] <valar1003> imagine TL beating navi KEKW
[0:55:48] <lowtierbean> @nblumberg LMAO
[0:55:52] <dinkydeckerz> @crazedwolf911 i know i was joking
[0:55:53] <valar1003> I want TL to win so bad though
[0:55:59] <JuiceW4H> Probably is just pressured since he's an awp after all every shot matters.

[0:56:27] <Expanses__> @fl0m Have you seen Mauisnake's podcast episode with Rlewis ? I think they had a great discussion on junior against Tier-1 teams. The conclusion almost was that junior can't do it in Tier 1, it's a very much a confidence issue rather than skill :(
[0:56:33] <chipper412> Is the stream frozen????
[0:56:39] <JakestersLab> Is nuke CoLs pick?

[2:06:56] <Hektic2> hello @fl0m I have a question. Ik its a little weird but its just something I was wondering for the future. Ik and I'm sure kids are something you and Nori want int the future. I mean I do when I become parents. But how do u see streaming when you do? Is it something you will try to manage in the future? Something you see doing when you do? I struggle myself too stay organized and prioritize things. Ik its pretty personal but I was jc

[4:50:15] <Speedrulez> Puddin_Wing still those wounds hurt like a bitch. <3 tiredness due to the hand or something else?
[4:50:15] <cronican> in silver we always go for it
[4:50:16] <mango2u2> why is naf entrying yikes nooooo he clutches :(
[4:50:20] <angus799> @fl0m issue with inferno is that Ts can rotate in almost the game time as CTs
[4:50:22] <Huddlesworth> PepeHands
[4:50:25] <Aut0Mag1c> they whiff again. just missing easy shots
[4:50:25] <diamonndcc> nt
[4:50:26] <G0urami> NOOOO NT PepeHands
[4:50:26] <Wojtekwolak666> Wat doink
[4:50:27] <tankwarhead> NOO
[4:50:27] <Speedrulez> twennyNumbers oldie peepoGiggles
[4:50:28] <audio_noodle> @fl0m imo it would sorta be nicer if you could save when down to 3 players by getting all of them back to tspawn for extract
[4:50:29] <tankwarhead> NOOO
[4:50:30] <masterjohn2> ??
[4:50:31] <twennyNumbers> peepoGiggles
[4:50:33] <mukulhayaran> nt
[4:50:33] <Revvylo> Maybe more money if CTs die when bomb is planted?
[4:50:36] <s1mply_AnT> ugh nt
[4:50:36] <Madfish2021> GJ b1t
[4:50:37] <Aut0Mag1c> whiffquid
[4:50:37] <audio_noodle> since typically saving just takes ages
[4:50:38] <Phantom410> what is going on with elige man he needs to pop
[4:50:40] <Konviction707> at least got that plant in
[4:50:41] <sjoerdtheman> what about making the ct loss bonus if you die after the round ends also 0 so its more risky to save, but not punishing fl0m
[4:50:41] <Puddin_Wing> I've played drums since I was like 10, supergluing hand wounds is somethin I'm well practiced at lol @mumblethyname
[4:50:42] <BoBthebuilder81> so should there be more bonus if you all go down swinging? lol
[4:50:44] <kamelski> its official, flom is pro choice

[5:58:05] <td_gg> or a 1v5, thats unthinkable. if a 1v5 ever happened in the pro scene i imagine that one of the players would stay up all night when he was supposed to meet his girlfriends parents for the first time that morning. but thatd never happen, right?

[12:43:36] <praeter15> How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a "bomb"? Instead of abilities they have "nades mollies and smokes". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant
