[1:59:42] <sphhax> @sk0ldier they are having a beta for crossplay and it came back from the dead
[1:59:44] <sphhax> I guess
[1:59:48] <nekojeremy1> all i hear while im playing cs is ball droped ball secured and its the funniest thing
[1:59:51] <drivel___> Prefiring in a new game your second time playing the map. Absolute 5head defo not wallhacking
[1:59:59] <sphhax> mugmouse I LITERIALLY PLAYED IT WHEN IT CAME OUT
[2:00:00] <Nightbot> Latest video: Spectating CS:GO Silver Games turned into a Drinking Game! w/ JERICHO - https://youtu.be/_FFx5XvoG8Y
[2:00:02] <sphhax> im going to lose my mind
[2:00:02] <eephusIRL> balls dropped, balls secured
[2:00:14] <theHovnival> but was that the beta or actual release @sphhax ?
[2:00:14] <golfwangfxck> just checked, this game is in my steam library. last played may 27 2019 KEKW
[2:00:25] <warcs_> wtf is this knockoff halo game?
[2:00:30] <Spudack> this game looks kinda fun tho
[2:00:33] <mugmouse> @sphhax I'm not talking about the beta
[2:00:35] <theHovnival> Okay. Finished downloading it.
[2:00:40] <sphhax> neither am I
[2:00:46] <tizmlane> @mugmouse search up when splitgate was first released
[2:00:47] <1nvative> @Spudack it's super fun
[2:00:51] <Dynamo_Dave> @sphhax I played it back then too. and it's still called a beta now
[2:00:51] <sphhax> they releunched the game chat
[2:00:58] <sk0ldier> @sphhax hell yeah, i had so much fun with this game

[2:01:31] <Nateulous> idiot
[2:01:32] <drivel___> It’s crazy cause it’s almost not even the game anymore. You can make a decent game that just has a great community and it’ll pop off. It’s why cs is still around. You play for the players not the game
