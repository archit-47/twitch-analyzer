[3:50:07] <Thedylanhipps> bububut fl0m he wasn't being niceeee :(
[3:50:08] <corver> shroud is right though for real
[3:50:15] <turtlesnubs> @SanchezzzKid there are some servers with !knife !gloves and !ws commands which let you test stuff out, just look for a community server with those tags
[3:50:22] <turtlesnubs> they normally advertise it in the tags / server naem
[3:50:24] <ChillyCross> Why doesn’t shroud like cs
[3:50:40] <hOUdInIcZ> shroud plays cs who cares if he’s toZIx
[3:50:47] <sylveonkid1> took shroud one time to be like can i co stream and esl was like of course

[3:55:35] <sjoerdtheman> shroud is actually poor if he doesnt have 2 pc's smileW
[3:55:35] <Shotgun_Chef> @fl0m tell us how you really feel

[3:55:51] <JaYaJ> the clip of him with j9 stew and tarik was funny as fuck tho about him complaining

[3:56:07] <siiiif> fl0m now tell us your thoughts on Valorant Peeposit
[3:56:08] <Shotgun_Chef> @fl0m doesnt shroud have like 10k hrs?
[3:56:17] <turtlesnubs> @AsSaSsInJ0HN its probably already too late LUL
[3:56:22] <saunce> no the internet is saying yoou aren't allowed to say negative thigns about the game after so many hours
[3:56:24] <Darra5> I mean that doesnt happen to me so why is he being a snowflake Kappa
[3:56:25] <flexluthertv> @Shotgun_Chef if not more
[3:56:27] <Indoorguitar> I think it would help shroud's case to be less: Valorant is like this and CS should be like that, and more just the issues, but I haven't watched him much so IDK
[3:56:27] <wakeupboom> wait whats the GOTV exploit?
[3:56:34] <sylveonkid1> i played cs 1.6 so when shroud says shite im like did you even play 1.6 how can you talk
[3:56:36] <AsSaSsInJ0HN> @turtlesnubs Sadge
[3:56:36] <stormshitman> dad the one part that i actually do enjoy of hltv is off topic late at night when talking about cool old  games and shit but i dont bother reading other shit i just see the titles and the titles themselves are omega dumb
[3:56:37] <The_Ganznoob> Only time Valve will change those things is if it effects the skin market Peeposit
[3:56:42] <nigentaum> Valve knows the skin market is not gonna die. So they are not going to do anything regarding cs in general.
[3:56:44] <Krzystofer> @fl0m Old school players are with you on the issues. Been playing since 1.6 you are 100% right and so is shroud.

[3:57:31] <numb3r_cs> @LucidR9 according to hltv Kelvin 5Head
[3:57:35] <turtlesnubs> it's definitely too late in the sense that like- if they fixed their shit before 2020, before the peak playercount hit, no doubt it would have peaked much higher and we would be enjoying much more popularity in cs

[4:12:41] <jakenjoi> just look at edpi, dpi means nothing if it doesnt include their sensitivity
[4:12:51] <pizza_lizard_> i like men PrideHeartL
[4:12:52] <budgetwaifu> Jammies
[4:12:57] <budgetwaifu> i too like men
[4:13:05] <Puddin_Wing> I don't like anyone
[4:13:07] <jakenjoi> s1mple is 400 dpi and like 2.2+ sens, so his edpi is like 1000
[4:13:08] <Puddin_Wing> who the fuck are you people

[4:13:30] <budgetwaifu> hi wookie fl0mH
[4:13:36] <IRunOnSlash> edpi is completely subjective, its about comfort
[4:13:43] <flexluthertv> is fl0m using a1s now?

[4:14:02] <jakenjoi> edpi is the dpi times the in game sensitivity
[4:14:11] <Ficii> !1080p
[4:14:11] <Nightbot> 936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.
[4:14:21] <Voidism_> OOOO
[4:14:22] <Puddin_Wing> OOOO
[4:14:24] <jakenjoi> so 400 dpi x 2.0 sens is the same as 800 dpi x 1.0 sens

[4:16:14] <flexluthertv> @soloman_mh better than dust 2 or mirage
[4:16:38] <siiiif> You are playing against Mythic. You do not veto Vertigo because you can beat them on it. Mythic instantly picks Vertigo. You lose against Mythic. You veto Vertigo next time you play against Mythic because you're not stupid.
[4:16:48] <evili21> I think it's so weird most pros use 400dpi when they could just use 800dpi and cut their in game in half
[4:16:55] <flexluthertv> You are playing against Mythic. You do not veto Vertigo because you can beat them on it. Mythic instantly picks Vertigo. You lose against Mythic. You veto Vertigo next time you play against Mythic because you're not stupid.
[4:17:17] <stormshitman> @evili21 it plays differently i tried that a long time ago
[4:17:23] <jakenjoi> pros should, its better to use higher dpi, better tracking
[4:17:25] <evili21> really?
[4:17:29] <alex_undov> i bet on t side they going to  4 a 1 mid

[4:17:32] <Ficii> @evili21 I think brazilians use 1600dpi, it's smoother than 400
[4:17:34] <IRunOnSlash> Tracking is not as important in CS
[4:17:47] <evili21> interesting
[4:18:14] <IRunOnSlash> Latency is the proper term
[4:18:29] <DullaTPG> tracking is not important? someone told me to focus on tracking instead of flicking
[4:18:40] <IRunOnSlash> Unless you mean sensor accuracy and spinouts
[4:18:47] <WookiePotamus> You are playing against Mythic. You do not veto Vertigo because you can beat them on it. Mythic instantly picks Vertigo. You win because Mythic doesn't defuse the bomb. You Pick Vertigo next time you play against Mythic because lightning can strike twice.

[4:18:55] <The_Ganznoob> just call them meese SHRUGGERS
[4:19:05] <jakenjoi> dpi has an effect on latency? i thought that was polling rate?
[4:19:07] <jussicaa> seyHey seyHey seyHey
[4:19:10] <siiiif> what about miceses?
[4:19:11] <WookiePotamus> i improved it @siiiif
[4:19:13] <IRunOnSlash> No, higher DPI lowers latency
[4:19:17] <stormshitman> @IRunOnSlash it is not as important but its very useful with low dpi but high dpi tracking doesnt exist unless someones actually cracked
[4:19:26] <F_R_I_A_R> no, but it might introduce pixel-skilpping
[4:19:26] <2020numbers> fl0m did they send you buns with your dogs? i cant find nathans buns anywhere Sadge
[4:19:28] <siiiif> WookiePotamus its not made to be improved, its from dota
[4:19:34] <Shotgun_Chef> I play on 16000dpi

[4:19:54] <xluvu2> Higher dpi is technically more accurate but you would never notice it as a human being
[4:19:56] <jakenjoi> so DONT play on 32000 dpi then?

[4:21:10] <unapologet1c> they should only deag
[4:21:14] <stormshitman> polling rate is a default these days of 1000 thats what has latency along with what parts and technology your mouse sues but most gaming mice doesnt add any latency to your game just pixel skipping

[4:26:01] <stormshitman> the 8k polling rate is a razer mouse im pretty sure and it apprently does have a difference but if you have been playing with 1k polling rate it feels off but not alot so it takes a while to adjust to because the difference is not small but not super large
[4:26:04] <LowRatedHighlander> F_R_I_A_R YEP he got sponsored for it
[4:26:08] <CozziVFX> best specs for cs but budget?

[4:44:57] <stormshitman> @Puddin_Wing also another reason feeny is that i for like a year or more i have used a 107 gram mouse and i am a hybrid player but play with s1mples sens so i need flicks and if your wrist doesnt feel like moving a heavy mouse some days it makes you play like shit
