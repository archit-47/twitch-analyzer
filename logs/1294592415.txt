You get the kit you have more than enough time to defuse. Can’t find it and can’t make it back in time so you look like an idiot

[7:15:54] <chummydegenerate> good to hear, will Mythic be doing the usual open qualifiers? maybe there is a chance to get a sticker this year?

[7:16:46] <Puddin_Wing> and any tutorial i could recommend would be yeeeears old and probably not there anymore, but Launders at least USED to have some really good KZ tutorials on his youtube channel @necroix0
[7:17:15] <Puddin_Wing> No, the cartoon is just animating story events from one part of their first campaign from CR @GFYMeowMix
[7:17:20] <necroix0> @Puddin_Wing ok i will look into that thank you
[7:17:25] <GFYMeowMix> @Puddin_Wing ah ok
[7:17:37] <Puddin_Wing> there's millions of nods to the campaign and little in-jokes that make it way better if you know CR well, but you can totally enjoy it without @GFYMeowMix
