[0:46:41] <Nightbot> fl0m's peripherals and other gear are here: https://pastebin.com/rBv4ck0G
[0:46:49] <l3ordon> Mythic masters is considers a major right?
[0:46:53] <justdanny> @Speedrulez i thought fl0m and jojo were playing premier this last season, before mythic's relegation anime arc?
[0:46:55] <supra_nightmare> @dankiyy sorry it was a layup LUL
[0:47:02] <ABTRUSE_AK47> pro wireless or death ader?\
[0:47:07] <SupraUK_> @l3ordon it's slightly more prestigious than the intel grand slam
[0:47:16] <Speedrulez> justdanny YEP and jojo moved to another team. and they play advanced

[0:48:03] <stlckbo> mythic masters is bascially the catalina wine mixer of cs
[0:48:07] <justdanny> @Speedrulez so jojo dropped down to advanced to work back into premier with this team. got it. so then what is open? fl0m has discussed working through open to go back into premier. Is that the same thing as advanced?
[0:48:24] <Speedrulez> open is below advanced justdanny
[0:48:29] <dotalegendery2> @justdanny  eesa has ladders
[0:48:31] <justdanny> jesus lots of levels
[0:48:38] <dotalegendery2> open main advance premier ?
[0:48:40] <dotalegendery2> i think
[0:48:45] <dankiyy> justdanny open is the first division, advanced is just before premier
[0:48:45] <JoJoDJ> open > intermediate > main > advanced > premier
[0:48:46] <StochasticDiscount> Open -> Main -> Advanced -> Premier -> EPL @justdanny
