[0:12:29] <weeeegy> the 1v5 was just 5 1v1's really disappointing :(
[0:12:30] <TheGamerFoxx> @SukksGaming that mans is crazy good
[0:12:30] <pifrancisco> their cockiness in closing out games always gets in the way
[0:12:31] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m Now we switch to galil main? PauseFish
[0:12:34] <St3amroller> Did you guys see the Gaules clip?
[0:12:36] <Boyinawell> running on fumes
[0:12:39] <sealer9> At least we get to watch them at blast in a few days with fl0m all to be let down again :)
[0:12:41] <ash588> getting clipped from awp for 13 damage
[0:12:41] <1nnocent_jack> why does it have to be NA team though NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:12:43] <fakeeskimo> I didnt even knew flom gifted me a sub
[0:12:44] <ash588> Sadge
[0:12:49] <Lia_de> there was no way liquid were going to win out after that
[0:12:51] <LLINOSCARPE> Galil only stream to pay respect @fl0m
[0:12:53] <SushiGmz> FeelsBad for AdreN
[0:12:53] <Semiproshark7> they were playing too passive
[0:12:54] <McBubba03> GG Blast next
[0:12:55] <not_soupy> well its not that new for us liquid fans
[0:12:56] <ellricc> people say liquid threw because of that 1 round but don't realize that heroic literally almost threw a fuckin 12-3 lead KEKW
[0:12:57] <keyboardhero14> can you explain why naf and stew didn't peek together but instead they hide on site??
[0:13:00] <MayoOnTheMic> i think the game just got too stressful for them
[0:13:00] <mcWoodst3r> @harrrrsh they should quadruple peek, or triple peek or lastly double peek
[0:13:01] <its_joviii> I literally said out loud "Please don't give it to him, it's fucking refrezh man" before he even got a kill
[0:13:02] <hugostigz710> i have to leave the stream for 5 mins Sadge i cant keep talking about his :(
[0:13:03] <masde_> NA not having enough ego maybe first ever
[0:13:04] <yump0d> do u use a hair straightener on that mane?
[0:13:07] <justiey> that 1v5 broke my heart Rainge
[0:13:08] <iretrasado> legit feel dead inside :(
[0:13:08] <inferno_1808> I am just waiting for ELIGE to release the comms of this match. Especially of that 30th round. @fl0m
[0:13:10] <eliten21> cocky from elige but putside of that not at all
[0:13:11] <Sem073> two kills and they just froze shit happens
[0:13:12] <mukulhayaran> I'm dead inside
[0:13:14] <G0urami> NODDERS
[0:13:16] <G0urami> agreed
[0:13:19] <datkidaa> someone has to take charge and be the big dick swinging and say Im fucking winning this for us
[0:13:20] <xremmyxcsgo> They could of double peaked
[0:13:23] <siiiif> chat hit this COPIUM
[0:13:23] <n0r13k> Why didn't NAF swing on Stew's contact?
[0:13:25] <xremmyxcsgo> In hindsight
[0:13:26] <karzza> @fl0m May I post the link to the 1v5 and you review it?
[0:13:26] <Sokhio> This sounds like a balloons moment
[0:13:27] <not_soupy> exept for the two guys wo pushed the smoke without a flash
[0:13:29] <handsupboiii> do you think there was an individual's fault from liquid?
[0:13:30] <sup3rn0va62> veiNODDERS
[0:13:30] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m use your plugs and ask for heart rates to be implemented. I bet refrezhs heart rate was over 200 KEKW
[0:13:31] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m Why your galil dont shoot like that? Kappa
[0:13:32] <mukulhayaran> COPIUM
[0:13:33] <td_gg> when does blast start up?
[0:13:33] <person612> at least they looked good throughout epl
[0:13:46] <siiiif> at least i got channel points from that COPIUM
[0:13:46] <UtkarshJr7> 16*
[0:13:49] <not_soupy> liquid plays 16th
[0:13:50] <sup3rn0va62> 16th ig
[0:13:51] <DavieWhy> NEED MORE COPIUM
[0:13:52] <philbinicus> can we watch more BLOONS
[0:13:52] <n0r13k> You're giving a lot of insight here, but why wouldn't NAF swing off Stew's death there?
[0:13:53] <xremmyxcsgo> They knew where refrezh was and they could of double peaked instead of hiding
[0:13:58] <Ratico_ttv> They let him kill ct while there is 2 on site that could've just spammed him through smoke to mindfuck him
[0:14:01] <BizarreMark> Pog
[0:14:01] <LLINOSCARPE> Which is hesitating which is the opposite of being too cocky
[0:14:04] <xremmyxcsgo> But that‚Äôs easy to say
[0:14:04] <becklespinaxx> why were fallen and naf both just staring at the wall? why didnt either of them hold anything?
[0:14:05] <its_joviii> Honestly idk why refrezh was spotting elige there elige definitely didnt expect that
[0:14:05] <sealer9> You think this will affect them going into blast ?
[0:14:06] <DavieWhy> PauseFish
[0:14:07] <7heMountain> ditched my gf to have a beer with you fl0m here, and be NA sadge
[0:14:09] <datkidaa> just do it easier to ask forgiveness than permission

[2:20:40] <future_jason> i've seen Liquid lose a 15-9 before Sadge flashbacks are coming again
[2:20:48] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing same here. I only wear contacts for sports
[2:20:56] <macbookfps> surely fl0m doesn't choke this game
[2:20:57] <slimrick6> @future_jason but they made an amazing comeback that‚Äôs a positive
[2:20:57] <WookiePotamus> oh yeah fl0m has a reddit KEKW
[2:20:58] <SukksGaming> @future_jason Dont mention liquid today Sadge
[2:21:04] <Puddin_Wing> I can't do contacts. Putting shit in my eyes isn't happenin for me @dweevers

[2:21:15] <GFYMeowMix> @Puddin_Wing have you thought about lasers?
[2:21:23] <macbookfps> Puddin_Wing i had night contacts for three years
[2:21:26] <beranabus__> "could be lower" *gasp* he's in lower
[2:21:27] <macbookfps> that shit was an experience
[2:21:30] <schottkyy> dude, glasses is shit.. i got so bad astigmatism the whole world gets warped in my peripheral vision .. i.e. when i wear glasses rather than contacts, i feel constantly drunk.. it's shit
[2:21:32] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing I was like that when I was younger but now no issues. didn't want to wear sport goggles playing football
[2:21:39] <Puddin_Wing> I assume that's expensive, and I don't have that kind of money @GFYMeowMix
[2:21:41] <GFYMeowMix> contacts are a must for sports

[2:22:02] <LowRatedHighlander> i love it
[2:22:02] <SukksGaming> @feeny its not that expensive anymore
[2:22:05] <Nemutai_jpeg> my girlfriend just said im sticky and i smell like coleslaw. I think i made the right life choices.
[2:22:07] <beranabus__> it was just how perfectly timed it was @fl0m  KEKW
[2:22:08] <macbookfps> GFYMeowMix i think if i could guarantee 8.5 hrs of sleep a night, i would switch to night contacts
[2:22:11] <Puddin_Wing> when I played like 5 seasons of footy a year I just didn't wear my glasses
[2:22:26] <Puddin_Wing> I can still see okay, things are just a little blurred. not enough to fuck with my depth perception or anything
[2:22:27] <GFYMeowMix> @macbookfps what are night contacts?
[2:22:34] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing I mean american football though and I was QB so I needed to see KEKW
[2:22:37] <slimrick6> @puddin_wing footy?
[2:22:41] <GFYMeowMix> ah, if you're eyes aren't that bad then it's definitely not worth the price
[2:22:42] <Rykun> weeee
[2:22:43] <dweevers> GFYMeowMix MacSawce ones you can sleep in
[2:22:45] <Puddin_Wing> football. soccer @slimrick6

[2:22:55] <slimrick6> @puddin_wing ah
[2:23:00] <slimrick6> @nemutai_jpeg who?
[2:23:03] <macbookfps> GFYMeowMix they're hard contacts that you wear during your sleep, and they compress your eyeball into a circl so you wake up with 20/20 vision, but over the course of the day your vision returns back to what it was
[2:23:06] <Binary_Letters> 155? what did i miss?
[2:23:07] <Nemutai_jpeg> @slimrick6 Messi?
[2:23:08] <dir7ycs> 155!?!?
[2:23:08] <GFYMeowMix> @dweevers huh, didn't know there were any. always told to take em out before bed.

[4:11:21] <fricks_lozf> Sadge
[4:11:22] <b0t_papa> real question: is there a reason you dont have a strong backup plan on the last piece top left?
[4:11:39] <LowRatedHighlander> ok 63 incoming
[4:11:45] <LowRatedHighlander> lets try to be prepared
[4:11:48] <LowRatedHighlander> monkaW
[4:11:57] <Dynamo_Dave> @b0t_papa he only has 2 snipers left to use
[4:12:11] <b0t_papa> Dynamo_Dave fair point
[4:12:41] <b0t_papa> POGGIES
[4:12:50] <b0t_papa> i did a thought! peepoClap
[4:12:55] <Dynamo_Dave> camo auto
[4:12:58] <Night_Legion> 0/2/4 backup sniper?
[4:13:07] <ElfmanShaggy> What is your opinion on twitch livestreaming vs Youtube live in the long term?
[4:13:23] <b0t_papa> ElfmanShaggy I believe LinkedIn moments is best
[4:13:30] <LeBlusz> plane upgrade would be nice
[4:14:00] <joshuwa72> ye plane
[4:14:22] <Dynamo_Dave> plane time
[4:14:28] <regularxiii> Pogu
[4:14:29] <BlueET3RNAL> save for spectre from here on maybe? seems like everything is gonna be ez for the next bit at least
[4:14:50] <BlueET3RNAL> or will he even get enough for it in time
[4:15:01] <LowRatedHighlander> spectre is a lot idk if he can save for it in time
[4:15:03] <LeBlusz> @BlueET3RNAL he can't buy spectre. He got 3/0/2 i think
[4:15:14] <regularxiii> Hey @chat how is y‚Äôall day going so far
[4:15:18] <BlueET3RNAL> nah he has neva miss, which is the 3rd on the bottom
[4:15:45] <LeBlusz> oh shit u right. didn't notice the darts curving
[4:16:12] <BlueET3RNAL> doesnt look like he'd have enough before round 80 anyways though
[4:16:37] <praeter15> youre barely gonna get 20k by 80
[4:16:42] <LowRatedHighlander> idk i wouldnt risk it
[4:16:46] <BlueET3RNAL> Probably just upgrade the snipers, I don't think you'd get enough fora  spectre in time
[4:16:53] <WallyWorldTV> sniper is gonna get blocked at crator tho i wouldnt
[4:16:53] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah i dont think youll have enough for spectre
[4:17:01] <b0t_papa> i think we eco here
[4:17:08] <BlueET3RNAL> yeah the snipers for sure
[4:17:09] <WallyWorldTV> but also price is too high for spec
[4:17:10] <b0t_papa> buy nades and a deag
[4:17:11] <LowRatedHighlander> force buy
[4:17:13] <LowRatedHighlander> lets go
[4:17:18] <Antiibiotic> Just buy some nades bro
[4:17:21] <b0t_papa> LowRatedHighlander monkaS
[4:17:43] <BlueET3RNAL> I think this setup wins here
[4:17:43] <b0t_papa> I hope we don't get aced here for a tie boys
[4:17:51] <BlueET3RNAL> round 78 is the big test, you got this flom
[4:19:00] <LowRatedHighlander> widepeepoHappy tbh i didnt know you were playing odyssey when i said to go the big bomb one so i kinda figured youd have an answer to camo sorry about that fl0m KEKW
[4:19:07] <BlueET3RNAL> man that was the lost round last time, didnt even break a sweat
