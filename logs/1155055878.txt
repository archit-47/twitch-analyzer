[0:24:52] <hunteo18> do you think NIP are the best team on ancient right now?
[0:24:58] <Doccy> needs to be more grayscale
[0:25:07] <yobtih> agree'd
[0:25:16] <jockst3r> idk about you but I feel like the donut part of the map is quite strange with the angles like its hard to peek into it
[0:25:21] <crustydumper_> A site blows
[0:25:35] <LowRatedHighlander> I mean other sites only have 1 safe spot too right? I know a is different like a you basically have zero safe plants
[0:25:35] <Semiproshark7> @jockst3r Basically half the map tho

[1:34:52] <SupraUK_> what about allowing teams to remove maps pre-veto, just like faceit premium?
[1:34:53] <njblumberg> i dont hate the idea. why shouldnt they play every map?
[1:34:54] <hemo_tox> I think we should just make all teams play all of the maps for every match
[1:34:55] <dasfuzion> hello
[1:34:56] <hobrev> randoming vetos was what valve was doing for years and people really hated
[1:34:59] <Expanses__> @saabeye oh thanx

[1:38:54] <SuperTuscan888> ShrapTy KKona darn tootin
[1:38:54] <marathon_fish> @fl0m i feel like the point of bo5s is less better cs but to make the finals feel like a bugger event than the rest of the tourny. I don‚Äôt disagree that bo5s are bad but just a diff perspective.

[3:45:59] <florusRL> Nah facts, I think the roster has tourney finalist potential, no beating navi tho

[3:46:03] <xremmyxcsgo> Do you think there is a real shortage of igls in na
[3:46:13] <margiela69> They are playing well but liquid lacks mental fortitude sometimes they just look so tilted
[3:46:15] <LowRatedHighlander> They‚Äôve beaten this Navi roster before though
[3:46:20] <LowRatedHighlander> If I‚Äôm not mistaken
[3:46:25] <dankiyy> put nitro at map and he bangs
[3:46:26] <LowRatedHighlander> On nuke too
[3:46:29] <future_jason> all NA IGL's are training the tier 2 talents or are in Valorant
[3:46:31] <xertold> do you think smooya could replace fallen when he retires
[3:46:33] <florusRL> This navi roster hitting different nowdays tho bro

[3:47:13] <margiela69> This looks like gg
[3:47:14] <ekstral0ve> but the serenity that nitro's presence brought in the team, brought the best out of elige and naf because they both prefer calm surrounding. no one can reproduce that, not fallen. they are diff personalitites

[3:48:35] <TheSolaceXD> LETSGO 15 IS ALL THEY GET JUST LIKE IN KATOWICE VS LIQUID
[3:48:37] <LowRatedHighlander> Elige comm videos are so enlightening
[3:48:38] <florusRL> YEP I thought so too
[3:48:45] <florusRL> yeah except navi
[3:48:45] <hemo_tox> Ninyas in Pyamas
[3:48:46] <LowRatedHighlander> These dudes are hyping each other up every play
[3:48:49] <small_tymer> if TL drops stew c9 is back immediately
[3:48:49] <abhi007bond> %? BOOBA
[3:48:50] <Nightbot> Joris says 81%
[3:48:54] <Aurorn> Whats your opinion of taking a chance and bringing in young talent like c9 did with stewie2k back in the day?
[3:48:58] <zefixlikescsgo> %? OT
[3:49:01] <future_jason> Liquid usually plays well against Na'VI
[3:49:05] <TLsmf> they know how to shut down navi
[3:49:07] <xertold> fl0m do you think smooya could replace fallen when he retire or contract runs up
[3:49:11] <ekstral0ve> no I actually based that off of the team with tarik and stew that elige played in one of the cash cups..it was stew who said that, when tarik was getting too excited in the comms, but yeah, I have not seen the elige comm videos
[3:49:12] <peepofat852> Liquid is simple's kryptonite
[3:49:12] <SupraUK_> navi brings the best liquid? what - vodka?
[3:49:14] <1downbad> that gambit match was rough too. they win that I dont think u see a 1v5 vs heroic.
[3:49:16] <dankiyy> navi usually plays poorly against tl too tbf
[3:49:16] <florusRL> Liquid are better vs teams they arent expected to beat
[3:49:16] <margiela69> Why would liquid ever drop stewie before grim
[3:49:17] <Justhoohaa> liquid aren't afraid of simple the same way astralis weren't
[3:49:19] <yourducky> okay then show BOOBA now abhi007bond
[3:49:23] <future_jason> Like before 2020 Liquid was to Na'Vi what Astralis is to Liquid
[3:49:24] <BuurgerMan> hey fl0m hit a pr on back squat today finally hit 100kg
[3:49:25] <macbookfps> 2020numbers holy shit you're gunna win stonks again, i got class in 2 min so i'll miss the next series prob Sadge
[3:49:31] <margiela69> I don‚Äôt think stew is the issue
[3:49:32] <LowRatedHighlander> Yaaaassss
[3:49:33] <hemo_tox> Liquid players need to focus on not cry-y-y-y-y-y-ing during a match and just closing games

[3:57:22] <xremmyxcsgo> Niko? Lol
[3:57:24] <Killer_Panda2k11> KennyS comes back as the entry AWPer EZ
[3:57:24] <bigfani> you didnt see anything NOPERS
[3:57:25] <Alwayspinchy> @the_shuck xd Im an expert with util in inferno but I don't have fuel to learn it on other maps
[3:57:28] <Alwayspinchy> xd
[3:57:28] <Scyperr> @fl0m why is nexa such a linch pin?
[3:57:29] <rolf_stone_fist> kennyS EZ
[3:57:30] <dankiyy> jackz is an insane entry
[3:57:32] <yourducky> I saw it all fani
[3:57:39] <monkakaidou> Me :)
[3:57:39] <kono_dio_da_4> @fl0m jacks was doing pretty well no?
[3:57:39] <TLsmf> hunter is just knockoff niko
[3:57:42] <margiela69> Fallen to G2 KennyS to liquid kekw
[3:57:45] <bigfani> Sadge
[3:57:46] <c0smosLIVE> of course they would
[3:57:48] <c0smosLIVE> ego war
[3:57:56] <Alwayspinchy> went from 7k to 50k in 2 games :)
[3:58:00] <kono_dio_da_4> @fl0m jackz was doing pretty well no?
[3:58:05] <Alwayspinchy> channel points
[3:58:08] <VashTS1> What my question was replace Niko or Hunter since they play the same role, Keep Jacks, Aman, Nex, Niko OR Hunter and Awp fl0m
[3:58:11] <zipslam> where are my fellow entry peeps
[3:58:14] <Scyperr> wait nexa is the IGL, I thought that was amanek?
[3:58:17] <StormbornVal> Is NIP able to utilize dev1ce to his potential??
[3:58:18] <need_a_name__> niko can igl so ......
[3:58:20] <SuperTuscan888> I loe entry fragging
[3:58:21] <SuperTuscan888> love
[3:58:22] <CasualCausality> that sounds like boombitch
[3:58:26] <TLsmf> swapping igl  means you wont be doing well for a few months
[3:58:26] <ozzers23> G2 should ask to replay this map.
[3:58:27] <PINKGU_Y> @VashTS1 KEKW
[3:58:28] <dankiyy> some would say its a stupid decision to remove em PeepoJuice
[3:58:29] <TheRock_as> Even thinking about being a pro IGL makes my head hurt
[3:58:30] <The_Shuck> @alwayspinchy youtube can literally change the game for you. some decent short clips and tips on util for every map
[3:58:32] <Chicxen> igl+entry is insane combo, like glaive
[3:58:34] <mukulhayaran> !1deag
[3:58:34] <ra1n1ngdeath> @need_a_name__ KEKW
[3:58:34] <Nightbot> mukulhayaran pops a 1deag on godlyflaw 1TAP
[3:58:35] <c0smosLIVE> nope he cant
[3:58:39] <TLsmf> KEKW
[3:58:39] <naMas000> @need_a_name__ he did... not a great result...
[3:58:40] <NERVg> @VashTS1 but then you take away the whole reason Niko is on the team. He wants to play with Hunter.
[3:58:40] <mukulhayaran> KEKW
[3:58:42] <margiela69> Niko igl and awp lol
[3:58:43] <dankiyy> niko igl brb lemme puke
[3:58:44] <Killer_Panda2k11> So AleksiB to G2?
[3:58:44] <xohl> faze KEKW
[3:58:49] <monkakaidou> G2 stewie sounds good
[3:58:49] <Aurorn> not entirely sure I want niko to igl anymore in my lifetime
[3:58:52] <PerhapsItsPeach> are we really going to have to watch NIP G2 3 times in this bracket ResidentSleeper
[3:58:52] <semtexnoise> @fl0m niko can coach too !
[3:58:59] <Lurzavic> asd
[3:59:00] <margiela69> I feel bad for g2 coach
[3:59:04] <apodis10> i feel like whenever niko igled, he did it out of frustration
[3:59:04] <TheBlankSkies> Niko new MSL
[3:59:06] <Piesso> i can igl :)
[3:59:10] <Alwayspinchy> @the_shuck im not a noob at the game but I'm just scared to get faceit
[3:59:10] <Deaths_Reaper1233> NiKo is not an IGL by nature. You can't force a star player to be something they aren't
[3:59:10] <zipslam> why does he look 3d generated
[3:59:13] <VashTS1> @NERVg I understand that, but at some point they all have to realize its not working
[3:59:18] <kono_dio_da_4> @fl0m  I thought jackz was doing pretty well why they talking about replacing him?
[3:59:18] <semtexnoise> igl, entry awper LUL
[3:59:22] <xohl> you want niko to focus 100% on his aim not calling
[3:59:22] <Quailman1234> @fl0m do you think Moses leaving liquid was a good coaching move?
[3:59:24] <margiela69> Niko new general manager
[3:59:30] <CasualCausality> are there less timeouts or am i imagining things?
[3:59:33] <manning_mat> DM me dad
[3:59:35] <TLsmf> and i think we lost to nip in a pretty stupid way
[3:59:35] <xremmyxcsgo> Man g2 put themselves in a tricky situation
[3:59:39] <sloveCS> g2 has a fun ancient
[3:59:41] <xXxSlayerShadowBadAssxXx> @fl0m Do you like beyblade??

[6:07:55] <TLsmf> why does it gotta be so fucking painful
[6:07:57] <concussionpls> Go NAVI!!!
[6:07:58] <McBubba03> @MaxofMine What do you mean Liquid is like Seattle, they always make it to the playoffs only to get assblasted by a better NA team (Astralis)
[6:08:01] <abhi007bond> %? peepoSit
[6:08:01] <Nightbot> Joris says 76%
[6:08:07] <Shepdogg77> NA league is such a joke

[6:08:40] <future_jason> TL fans have went though the jumping Cold awp, losing in the Cologne 2016 finals, getting murked by Faze in NY 2017, not winning anything but Summit in 2018, always losing to Astralis, getting the Grand Slam in record time just to lose to Astralis at the Major, in 2020 to losing to Furia every game, and to now where they made a crazy comeback just to end up losing it to a 1v5 against a galil. Team Liquid fans understand pain
[6:08:51] <sleeeeppyyyy> its okay MaxofMine . McBubba03 is still in pain from the 1v5 KEKPOINT
