[2:19:31] <Nightbot> H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)
[2:19:31] <The_Ganznoob> I mean bro a power supply is like $50 decently strong one that will last years. If your power supply does go bad and you let it go it could cause a fire. It might not be the power supply though :) Zeyzo_

[4:00:42] <mem0ryfps> Steamboat?
[4:00:48] <Zeyzo_> for a console its kinda low most consoles are 5-600
[4:00:48] <yobtih> wtf is a steam deck
[4:00:48] <sphhax> it should run all Windows games as well, using a compatibility layer SO devs dont even need linux versions
[4:00:50] <stucko> @yobtih valve releasing a portable console
[4:00:52] <candynade> steamdeck.com
[4:00:55] <SupraUK_> nope
[4:00:55] <ChosenDew> @yobtih valve's version of the switch
[4:01:00] <SyncingPlatypus> compare it to a new iPhone and its nothing
[4:01:00] <AchromiK> Starts at $400 fl0m
[4:01:05] <Mr_Motumbo> It's pretty comparable I think
[4:01:05] <Zeyzo_> oh its a switch
[4:01:06] <yobtih> bro my fucking MM teammates are going to fucking really blow now
[4:01:06] <SupraUK_> there's small handheld gaming PC things that cost about the same
[4:01:07] <Uwotm08> https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeck
[4:01:08] <AchromiK> The big boy one is $650
[4:01:15] <mem0ryfps> @yobtih its like a bunch of buttons that do different things you can program
[4:01:18] <raindeathroses> cs on switch??
[4:01:19] <Evilgeo2> I mean a switch was like $300 at release so $400 for a steamdeck doesn't seem that bad
[4:01:21] <WookiePotamus> !suck steamdeck

[4:03:05] <SupraUK_> it doesn't mention game streaming but surely the steamdeck will allow you to stream games from your PC onto it
[4:03:17] <SupraUK_> that could be an option which will allow you to play non-steam games on the deck
