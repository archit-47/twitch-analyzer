[0:35:46] <UtkarshJr7> kekw
[0:35:47] <F1niteCS> Hey all peepoJuice
[0:35:48] <d3xtrous_> !936p
[0:35:48] <Nightbot> 936p provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown; however, it was causing issues with fl0m's resolution, so he switched to 1080p.
[0:35:48] <UtkarshJr7> KEKW
[0:35:50] <carboxylate1> WICKED
[0:35:51] <BuSheeZy> @fl0m I was wondering about that myself, lol. I have been using 936p and was wondering if there was some new hotness
[0:35:52] <k1r1to_kun_> wait eu teams talk trash? WUT
[0:35:53] <Nethern> bet you can't wait!
[0:35:56] <bluehipp0> why not 1440p ? KEKW

[0:36:31] <dimesntreys> !1080p
[0:36:31] <Nightbot> 936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.

[3:51:02] <PEAC3> i feel like elige would be the one to keep it positive between the team
[3:51:03] <downbadceo> 1 round can decide the whole BO3. very important
[3:51:03] <zeniithx1> i mean he died in the first 5 seconds last round
[3:51:04] <eldrago125> stewie feels like he could have done something

[3:51:45] <1amdaredevil> @Rennerr ironically, I am a mental health counselor :D
[3:51:46] <EGGsticle> i mean that was the round that could have gotten the momentum back for liquid and fallen literally threw, id be mad to.
[3:51:47] <ToothlessTacoFPS> you need players that are emotionally in it
[3:51:52] <JFizzlestein> they also need these CT rounds
[3:51:52] <Hektic2> I honestly feel bad for fallen. it was a honest mistake tbh
[3:51:56] <valar1003> is TL playing better now cuz they don't have pressure?

[4:16:16] <Demonara> KEKW TRUEEE
[4:16:16] <msxdxa> that's why benched players should play in the middle of the match and players like graim should be changed in the middle of the game
[4:16:20] <McBubba03> I mean, it would've worked Kappa
