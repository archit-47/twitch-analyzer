[0:26:18] <JohnN156> VP 3-0 and sharhs 0-3
[0:26:19] <csgomunchin> My Brain
[0:26:24] <AMutantCookie> Ence could go 0-3 too imo
[0:26:26] <tdjd55> its best of 1 in beggining
[0:26:27] <Asura317> "no way g2 are going to fuck this up"
[0:26:27] <sleeeeppyyyy> n0r13k token = drops

[0:26:39] <Cyan_die> tyloo's first match is heroic, shark's first match is MOUZ @fl0m
[0:26:43] <shittyarn> heyooo chat and @fl0m
[0:26:45] <ElaD_O> @fl0m what do you think about godsent? I have them going through
[0:26:52] <Sem073> All hail king Bntet at London 2018
[0:26:55] <michaisn> There is alot of Brazilian teams in this Major
[0:26:58] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m So, you have to predict the winner of that match. If you win : You get 5Gifted , but if you lose : you have to play a short MM match in between the games but the chat will set the rules (like play without the headsets or play with this sense or play using you mouse with your left hand, etc)
[0:27:00] <yaJgnizamA> tyloo is like me, good for one
[0:27:00] <Asura317> fr @michaisn
[0:27:01] <sjoerdtheman> davelanza_03 he can stream the major
[0:27:02] <Gittawat_> so they are tyLUL KEKW
[0:27:03] <NextDoorGuy> tyloo always fucks pickems for 0-3, they will win a game everytime
[0:27:09] <n1tr099> Entropiq going through pog

[0:27:16] <SupraUK_> i put spirit down for my 3-0 because i'm not getting burned by these bo1s
[0:27:20] <GodsCookie> Pain 0-3
[0:27:20] <sjoerdtheman> YEP Pog

[0:30:58] <MisonS2> the nice part is you only have to get 5 correct on this part
[0:30:58] <officialkenkaN> ENCE 3-0 Kappa
[0:30:58] <Off1ine__> dont risk ence in 3-0
[0:30:59] <arfreesze> YEP
[0:31:01] <bioeagle_eagle> ence is more reliable than CF
[0:31:01] <SupraUK_> i put spirit down for 3-0 because fuck losing ence to a 3-1
[0:31:02] <DownbeatAura> Spirit 3-0 for sure right?
[0:31:05] <G3RONlMO> Isn't this just challengers stage?
[0:31:05] <ardinura> ence has such a good firepower
[0:31:05] <Killer_Panda2k11> I made Astralis my 3-0
[0:31:06] <MikeTysonsPinky> Heroic 3-0 is easy pick tbh

[0:31:41] <PolynomC> How are they seeded? I'd go based off that
[0:31:43] <Off1ine__> @Killer_Panda2k11 dont put astralis 3-0, they will for sure make it thru but if they go 3-1 you lose your 3-0 pick and an advance pick
[0:31:43] <SquiDI0> it's gonna be first LAN and Major for a lot of them, maybe it will play on it
[0:31:45] <m1chael3k> a lot of people are saying movistar might get through but idk
[0:31:45] <AMutantCookie> I think it's safer to go 0-3 on Ence than 3-0

[0:37:09] <Killer_Panda2k11> Astralis, Heroic, Mouz, VP, Faze are really good 5 picks to advance
[0:37:10] <Shepdogg77> astralis are going to get the major buff
[0:37:11] <TiMBA_Jaro> i dunno, MOUZ looks kinda iffy so far
[0:37:11] <nousn0u> VP jave Sanji kicked
[0:37:15] <duedrama> I fully think Faze could go 3-0, its lan
[0:37:16] <yourducky> zahb fight me pussy peepoBox
[0:37:17] <nishantg00ner> FAZE

[0:37:18] <LowRatedHighlander> I think you’re right with the ence 3-0
[0:37:20] <bioeagle_eagle> @fl0m mouz is kinda shaky
[0:37:22] <PolynomC> I don't think Mouse is a sure thing.
[0:37:23] <silvernade> spirit in bo1? u sure?
[0:37:25] <ACose4> i would lock big or faze above mouz
[0:37:25] <j1t5s> faze on lan better than VP
[0:37:26] <freyshx> dude the new mouse logo is so bad
[0:37:28] <sarvmiester> @fl0m VP kicked Sanji
[0:37:28] <a732v> LOL I forgot mouse changed logos, I was so confused
[0:37:28] <Josz_belz> ence for 3-0 is puzzling me
[0:37:28] <Speedrulez> fanny i could just use some tiddy Sadge Clap
[0:37:34] <WookiePotamus> @suprauk_ there is an MG coin?

[0:50:49] <kannar_tv> MODS oilers
[0:50:51] <kannar_tv> err
[0:50:52] <apoodle10> another contributing factor might be that for like half of simples career with a functioning team has been under lockdown conditions

[4:01:20] <siiiif> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there.

[4:01:35] <mukulhayaran> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there.

[4:26:17] <vrajio> If i give dad a timeout, does he have to sitout of the game for 10 mins
[4:26:30] <Se1rac> @vrajio yes
[4:26:35] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m So, you have to predict the winner of that match. If you win : You get 5Gifted , but if you lose : you have to play a short MM match in between the games but the chat will set the rules (like play without the headsets or play with this sense or play using your mouse with your left hand, etc)
[4:26:57] <STatisfacti0n> that's actually kind of a great idea @UtkarshJr7
[4:27:12] <WookiePotamus> @UtkarshJr7 thats a good idea except the queue times are too long

[4:27:18] <bluehipp0> isn't that almost griefing though?
[4:27:18] <sh1f0> @UtkarshJr7 dude imagine liquid loses and then he plays MM, we might as well hang a rope
[4:27:21] <daba_roux> I went to pay my car payment on my computer, and during clicking pay it took way too long to respond so I clicked 5 more times. Now 5 months have been payed lololol

[4:28:34] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m what if we do UtkarshJr7's idea but just make it so that if you get a prediction wrong, you have to play a pug with me when the major isn't going on? PauseFish
[4:28:46] <sevengaming_tv> fl0m long stream today or is there another banger later? PauseFish
[4:28:51] <WookiePotamus> is it because that system is a big plus smileW ok ill leave
[4:28:52] <bluehipp0> @WookiePotamus The system was first employed at a chess tournament in Zurich in 1895 by Julius Müller,[2] hence the name "Swiss system"
