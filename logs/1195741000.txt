It is easy to 2 exit kills at end of every round. Sometimes 3 when some stupid noob try to knife me. I always top scoreboard & my noob team try to play objective. I reach Silver Elite Master soon.

[4:56:01] <SAMURAI1011> awp pistol round ?
[4:56:02] <BizarreMark> MmmHmm I like Jame
[4:56:06] <c_killem797> @sh1f0 time difference maybe??
[4:56:08] <praeter15> sh1f0 games can go past their scheduled time
[4:56:11] <mukulhayaran> DinkDonk jame is bot awper DinkDonk
[4:56:14] <dorfenklus> Qikert / Buster / Jame have been a unit, why are we assuming they disagree with his strat?
[4:56:25] <sh1f0> @c_killem797 no it s all in my time
[4:56:26] <diamonndcc> for me VP was the least plesant team to watch on this major tbh... just so many cringe and akward moments and plays
[4:56:27] <cheesleychester> good point
[4:56:28] <apklps> Jame's alright but easy to expect and not used to LAN it seems
[4:56:34] <pad4paris> fl0mWalk
[4:56:36] <pad4paris> fl0mWalk fl0mWalk
[4:56:37] <RobertCamposs> there is no X factor in VP
[4:56:39] <Gour204> jame way to passive
[4:56:41] <mgu_op> yeah VP getting so far is unfortunate for this team, it will stop changes into a better system
[4:56:42] <mamluku> even s1mple doesnt require awp that mucn @fl0m
[4:56:43] <MANIKcc> they don't have to with simple because he can actually use other guns
[4:56:48] <SAMURAI1011> !uptime
[4:56:48] <Nightbot> 4 hours 57 minutes 3 seconds
[4:56:48] <kian_dn> well said, he s jame time KEKW
[4:56:49] <yobtih> I've said it sicne day 1 VP are ONLINERS OMEGALUL
[4:56:49] <andrewmedaTV> jame needs a team that is more like astralis style where jame can sit there and hold an angle and knows that he isnt going to get flanked. right now the team around him seems disjointed on CT half the time
[4:56:52] <THE_eZeKieL> fl0m spitting fact
[4:56:56] <Marrowalk> Remember when HAPPY was the IGL in ENVY, he would always put himself in a good position
[4:56:59] <Venican> VP is honestly just so boring to watch.. I wish they were eliminated earlier.

He grew up in a poor country and we never had awp. we couldn't afford awp, just p250 for our children to eat. if you would be so kind and not make fun of my son please, or I will report

[7:36:57] <McBubba03> @siiiif pokiW

[8:07:45] <AFugy> KEKPOINT "Pick Hampus" Chat said
[8:07:45] <yaJgnizamA> you dont need riflers you just need COPIUM
[8:07:46] <Rinm> need more power
[8:07:47] <iBUYPOWER> HAMPUS GO CRAZY
[8:07:55] <dbz1h> would you take dupreeh and magisk?
[8:07:57] <twaisz> who is a viable option tho? i dont think dupreeh is
[8:07:57] <mastaadmi> Do you think Niko should be there with s1mple and zywoo for the best player in the world ?
[8:08:06] <Fattz808> fl0m bay bay
[8:08:11] <macIaren> I think teams are going to look for hampus @fl0m  Fragging IGL
[8:08:13] <Cacemen> cacemen to nip and the win major PauseFish
[8:08:14] <xsinkee> dupreeh inc
[8:08:16] <sol1taire> depreeh and magisk to go NIP - in for plopski and LNZ :-D
[8:08:17] <icecoldnew> duupreeh joining NIP
[8:08:17] <plurk> only because he used "go skill" spell on himself
[8:08:18] <shoxy1212> @fl0m Rez wwas good too
[8:08:19] <sjoerdtheman> Niko go kill PeepoM
[8:08:26] <Asura317> Niko went brrrrr
[8:08:26] <diamonndcc> i swear device was always overrated and it helped his game alot the fact that he was in such a good team overall, i don t think he has the capacity to consistently carry a team to W day after day
[8:08:26] <Fattz808> I just had Nutella uncrustable. shit slaps
[8:08:27] <thegunarse> niko carried g2 hard
[8:08:29] <Sleepy__Dan__> just better fl0mSmort
[8:08:31] <hamush> desk mainly talked about nip being out gunned, but honestly, it looked like g2 knew every move beforehand nip was making on inferno
[8:08:34] <moosE3knucklE> i see NiP Dupreeh coming after today's annoucement
[8:08:36] <sleeeeppyyyy> Cacemen I wouldnt even pick you to play against 100yr olds paapoWeird
[8:08:39] <mamluku> g2 doesnt play that way with gambit or navi @fl0m

[8:09:21] <theodoric98> but b1t has done it
[8:09:22] <falaflani> LNZ also replaced Ztr
[8:09:23] <djues333> !1deag
[8:09:23] <Nightbot> djues333 pops a 1deag on underworldnaiad 1TAP
[8:09:23] <sol1taire> LNZ over-performed this major
[8:09:24] <icecoldnew> like bit from navi 100% next superstar and i think he will deliver on stage as well
[8:09:25] <hamush> LNZ > Plopski
[8:09:25] <capital_v> b1t?
[8:09:28] <mamluku> and b1t
[8:09:28] <theodoric98> B1T

[8:09:33] <iBUYPOWER> hi
[8:09:33] <sol1taire> LNZ for someone so young and no experience over-performed
[8:09:35] <espl1ce> man like ropz??
[8:09:36] <dajmoxker> @iBUYPOWER When do we see the IBP team resurrection?
[8:09:39] <moosE3knucklE> honestly i see NiP Dupreeh and Magisk coming after today... alot of teams that stayed a certain way for so long like Fnatic being Swedish and now are UK are changing so NiP could go Danish/swedish
[8:09:41] <eclipse42> @iBUYPOWER toxi
[8:09:42] <Steelnex> true
[8:09:42] <arAEdeN> coldzera
[8:09:43] <iBUYPOWER> @dajmoxker uhh idk
[8:09:44] <thegunarse> @iBUYPOWER Kissahomie
[8:09:45] <eclipse42> toxic
[8:09:45] <freddie_from_mercury> b1t is just built differently
[8:09:46] <stormshitman> s1mple also had to play on a bunchof shit russian teams in the beginning
[8:09:46] <falaflani> Zywoo was a star from the get go
[8:09:50] <dbz1h> monesy

[8:10:04] <theodoric98> NIKO FOR WORLD PRESIDENT
[8:10:07] <Byiff> who stays? plopski or lnz?
[8:10:08] <freddie_from_mercury> @falaflani zywoo is also not human
[8:10:18] <eclipse42> @Byiff neither. hampus.
[8:10:18] <mamluku> g2 doesnt play this way against gambit or navi, they can match g2 pound per pound @fl0m
[8:10:21] <icecoldnew> true
[8:10:22] <sol1taire> I can put up a good fight vs Niko in 1 v 1
[8:10:27] <Darkagespawn> monkaHmm
[8:10:34] <djues333> mamluku which is exactly why G2 played this way in this game
[8:10:37] <moosE3knucklE> i dont think plop or LNZ stay
[8:10:40] <hamush> hampus, device, rez, myb leave LNZ, plopski deff out
[8:10:45] <djues333> mamluku because they knew they could basically just outaim them
[8:10:50] <asadin95> ibuypower gd
[8:10:56] <Byiff> who takes igl @eclipse42 ?
[8:10:56] <xertold> i was in a dm with dumau yesterday and holy the skill gap it made me realise how good these t1 pros are
[8:10:57] <MeterMaid1> to many throws and inconsistent from NiP
[8:10:59] <diamonndcc> HE DIDN T HAD A BAD TOURNAMENT... he can t be the carry of a team... he just performs when the team also performs

[8:11:05] <faidros> -LNZ +dupreeh
[8:11:05] <PepperR6> @fl0m thoughts on a Liquid roster change?
[8:11:06] <iBUYPOWER> hampus big carry
[8:11:08] <gbkisonline> there is no proof that device will actually perform in NiP like he did in astralis
[8:11:08] <faidros> NOW
[8:11:10] <Nukcle> Niko is a cheatcode
[8:11:12] <moosE3knucklE> LNZ was the lowest rated player of the G2 match... he got 11 kills on inferno and 6 on mirage
[8:11:14] <thegunarse> device is so sexy BOOBA
[8:11:15] <哞尻> who's your top 1 player? @fl0m
[8:11:17] <Steelnex> dupreeh will help dev1ce as well i feel
[8:11:20] <mamluku> @djues333 nip needs a lot of work and better players
[8:11:22] <asynine> flames probably would have matched up better with g2 tbh
[8:11:31] <faidros> Copenhagen Flames beat G2 at IEM Fall. They would have done better than NiP
[8:11:32] <GiraffePig> @djues333 you're cute
[8:11:37] <generic_gaming_245> @diamonndcc he went to NIP to prove he could be a hard carry
[8:11:38] <mastaadmi> Niko, s1mple or Zywoo
[8:11:39] <K2A222> 5 HEaD
[8:11:42] <eclipse42> @GiraffePig monkaW
[8:11:46] <djues333> GiraffePig no u
[8:11:46] <icecoldnew> dupreeh is probably joining NIP i think it will be insane

[8:11:52] <diamonndcc> @generic_gaming_245 yeah, and look how this is going
[8:11:53] <mn_n> @fl0m What do you think about G2 vs Heroic?

[8:12:03] <generic_gaming_245> @diamonndcc not well lol
[8:12:09] <moosE3knucklE> oh dupreeh is going to NiP he bought an appartment in sweden recently
[8:12:19] <PepperR6> thoughts on Liquid performance, roster changes, LAN mentality?
[8:12:26] <K2A222> SIMP FOR LIFE <#
[8:12:31] <mastaadmi> Niko on the same level as S1mple and zywoo
[8:12:34] <PapaMorris> didnt he even broke up with his gf ?
[8:12:37] <gbkisonline> You don't get my point, NiKo went to G2 he can carry, im sure if s1mple went somewhere else he could still carry but dev1ce never did it elsewhere, thats why im saying this. I think this is his chance to prove himself
[8:12:37] <MaxerCSGO> device and his girlfriend has broken up
[8:12:38] <icecoldnew> dupreeh bought apartment in sweden stockholm
[8:12:40] <faidros> And they are not even together now
[8:12:42] <K2A222> Its like going to florida when you retire
[8:12:47] <sweminy> thank you for being a grown-up @fl0m <3
[8:12:48] <Pr0phetic> Astralis entire system is so unique and based around dev1ces style etc. He still does well in NIP considering how much worse the rest of the team is
[8:12:48] <moosE3knucklE> whats going on with the IBP Mythic thing and Tarik playing for EG. thats cool!
[8:12:51] <b0t_papa> Chat having shit takes???? No wayyyyy
[8:12:52] <code_xcal> i miss liquid on lan BibleThump
[8:12:52] <iBUYPOWER> do i have ok takes fl0m peepoShy
[8:12:53] <MrSirPrincessTy> @fl0m Do you think if NIP beat G2 they had a chance to beat Heroic?
[8:12:55] <b0t_papa> Kapp
[8:12:58] <plurk> haha he failed haha

[8:12:59] <stockus> treating it like a job you know? Makes sense.
[8:13:01] <Krims0n__> these dudes that say that, never been with a girlfriend
[8:13:09] <Doccy> @b0t_papa not just chat stripSip
[8:13:10] <alpinestartgate> personal life should always stand above work life
[8:13:10] <F1niteCS> monkaW is that a drink cup
[8:13:10] <hamush> people who laugh at him for loosing his gf never had one lol
[8:13:10] <EffitAhl> @fl0m why you logical and sexy.
[8:13:10] <daredev1ltv> chat is just jealous device had a girlfriend
[8:13:12] <Nukcle> These people just dont know what its like to be in a relationship so they  have the shittest takes
[8:13:13] <generic_gaming_245> @fl0m so you're saying that whole narrative was just made up by NiP for a PR stunt? I mean I believe it I just want to make sure that's what you're saying
[8:13:15] <faidros> They aren’t together now. Other than NiP what’s his incentive to stay in NiP???
[8:13:15] <Darkagespawn> FeelsBadMan
[8:13:16] <random_factz> peepoRiot I don't want to grow up
[8:13:21] <PottsnPannz> He still obviously weighed all the options, and still found it to be the best
[8:13:22] <theodoric98> so many insane players out of CIS now

[8:13:50] <yobtih> You talking about me?
[8:13:51] <gbkisonline> I never called him bad, i just said we've never seen him reach level outside of astralist roster, thats just a fact, dont know why so upset :D

[8:13:59] <AJJay> facts
[8:14:01] <diamonndcc> that s why i think device can never be in the talk for the GOAT, sure he was having great performances, but i don t think he has GOAT potential
[8:14:06] <theodoric98> what do you think of MONESy?
[8:14:07] <joeyoctv> @fl0m feel the same way about smurfs
[8:14:11] <sweminy> @icecoldnew wooot?
[8:14:11] <b0t_papa> yobtih no one is ever talking about you (<3)
[8:14:11] <deadwing97> Yo it's not only about personal stuff, astralis has been going a lot of shit and propaganda
[8:14:16] <SinisterAlleys> !squad
[8:14:16] <moosE3knucklE> @iBUYPOWER well damn. go get some sleep!
[8:14:16] <Nightbot> fl0m’s guests are tarik, Zap, Semphis, Vince, moe, Maui, Sabby, and slasher
[8:14:16] <sol1taire> Props to LNZ for an amazing tournament
[8:14:19] <Nukcle> Those messages were directly directed towards Hitboy right fl0m
[8:14:19] <generic_gaming_245> @fl0m i have nothing against him going to NIP, they just talking too much smack and couldnt back it up
[8:14:20] <Toldam01> CS Community being toxic? what a surprise... FeelsBadMan
[8:14:20] <shiningtyguy> The desk said he went to NIP to prove he can be great outside astralis system.  Like Tom Brady wanted to do with Bellicheck/Patriots
[8:14:23] <1KERY> thats just straigth up childish..
[8:14:23] <TheFatDemon> People don't get that the fact that he has the ABILITY to do change teams pretty much at will don't have much experience with the world
[8:14:25] <EffitAhl> I mean, my gf makes me do social shit and I hate her for it. Let me sit a home.
[8:14:29] <Doccy> i reckon if u ask them what is wrong about it they couldn't give you an answer
[8:14:31] <faidros> @thegunarse wouldn’t stop top teams from offering to buy him out if he wanted/offered himself
[8:14:36] <icecoldnew> yes dupreeh bought apartment in sweden
[8:14:36] <deadwing97> astralis also has been shady as fuck
[8:14:36] <bl1pblap> do you think astralis do better at this major if he stayed?
[8:14:38] <hamush> astralis is shady AF, fuck them for doing that to bubzkji
[8:14:40] <LowRatedHighlander> generic_gaming_245 esports has a lot of shit talk
[8:14:44] <LowRatedHighlander> its what makes the scene fun
[8:14:51] <LowRatedHighlander> everyone who is fun to watch talks shit
[8:14:51] <generic_gaming_245> you gotta back it up tho
[8:14:54] <F1niteCS> fl0m are you wrapping up? I just got home but may go watch your VOD of NIP and G2
[8:14:58] <lakupipo> not sure about dupreeh role in nip? feel like him and rez have the same role but then ur left with lnz and plopski.
[8:15:01] <luc_53> fl0m i haven't gotten my gold coin yet and the game hasn't said i put my picks through even though i have, is this same for everyone? ty
[8:15:03] <yobtih> Furia will win tomorrow. I can’t wait for the upset.
[8:15:04] <sanmitra> monkaHmm True
[8:15:06] <Xschmise> Thorin is also so annoying, CONSTANTLY firing at him
[8:15:09] <generic_gaming_245> if you can't back it up, expect it to backfire
[8:15:13] <Rinm> how long it take simple to get navi were it is now
[8:15:19] <Pertre> wait deeve and his gf broke up?
[8:15:20] <LowRatedHighlander> nah\
[8:15:23] <LowRatedHighlander> still do it
[8:15:27] <shiningtyguy> Def not but someone as competitive as that I would be surprised if he didnt go to NIP, partly, to make his own legacy
[8:15:28] <LowRatedHighlander> cause its fun to watch when it backfires
[8:15:30] <hamush> they're giving their takes bruh
[8:15:31] <dankiyy> paid to paint the narrative
[8:15:33] <icecoldnew> true
[8:15:35] <sol1taire> @yobtih Yes. There's alwaysn upset in major. And Furia will cause an upset tomorrow.
[8:15:40] <generic_gaming_245> @LowRatedHighlander u right
[8:15:41] <HRB1> almost a year before he left astralis already was playing bad
[8:15:42] <thegunarse> @faidros but what would buy him out
[8:15:43] <random_factz> fl0mSmorting always go with the more intresting story
[8:15:50] <daredev1ltv> PROVACATIVE, IT GETS THE PEOPLE GOING
[8:15:52] <stormshitman> fl0m you had any expectations for chat to have 1 IQ CrungoSmile
[8:15:53] <icecoldnew> facts
[8:15:53] <yobtih> Stimulate me daddy
[8:15:54] <b0t_papa> No one knows what it means, it's provocative. Gets the people going.
[8:15:54] <mamluku> @Rinm it didnt take s1mple really, management was really attached to edward flamie and zeus
[8:16:02] <ggTeaTime> @fl0m You also do dig yourself into a hole when you're saying you want to be the best publicly
[8:16:06] <theodoric98> thorin... irish knob
[8:16:09] <irratattz> porovokotovo
[8:16:10] <ggTeaTime> Even if it's definitely not true yeah
[8:16:15] <Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @moosE3knucklE (warning)
[8:16:15] <faidros> What could have been: device, gla1ve, xyp9x, k0nfig, BlameF....
[8:16:21] <VoinkRotmg> thoughts on gambit v furia?
[8:16:23] <faidros> Fuck!!
[8:16:24] <hamush> if it were like that, reality tv shows would never come to be
[8:16:24] <deadwing97> astralis also has been shady as fuck
[8:16:27] <chromaticc_> i just ignore thorin FeelsOkayMan
[8:16:30] <luc_53> @fl0m did you get gold coin?
[8:16:35] <Sleepy__Dan__> that's a standard cliche LUL
[8:16:41] <falaflani> only CS employs a professional troll like Thoorin on the desk
[8:16:42] <ascend_b> just saw the new for the IBP cup @fl0m ! Congratz mate !
[8:16:46] <Zayzel> I wanna be bad and get paid for it.
[8:16:46] <daredev1ltv> "I want to be a mid-tier player and collect a check"
[8:16:47] <gbkisonline> Not everyone says it tho
[8:16:47] <Doccy> ME tbh
[8:16:58] <Toldam01> I wanna be the s best
[8:16:58] <moosE3knucklE> i have to agree with the desk tho... They brought LNZ to the main team wayyyyy to early
[8:16:58] <Doccy> i am professionally bad at ccs
[8:16:59] <b0t_papa> @fl0m what's your stance on the minesweeper increase for Microsoft 2007 though?
[8:17:01] <irratattz> i want to be, the very best, like no one ever was
[8:17:01] <luckinout1> "I'd like to be number 2"
[8:17:02] <Doccy> cs*
[8:17:02] <sweminy> yeah, the player that answers "I wanna be, the very best... average there ever was" is just ... no.
[8:17:02] <hamush> to give 110% comment gets me every time
[8:17:03] <gbkisonline> Saying i wanna be the best sets the expectations of the peopleň
[8:17:05] <alpinestartgate> I want to be the worst player in the world
[8:17:07] <b0t_papa> *update
[8:17:09] <random_factz> :) I don't want to be the best :) I am the best
[8:17:12] <Darkagespawn> Everyone wants to be CM Punk? Pog ;) DinkDonk
[8:17:13] <yobtih> I’m gunna blame REZ for not showing up
[8:17:25] <Gekko125> "I just want to get paid tbh"
[8:17:27] <moosE3knucklE> im glad the desk wasnt so harsh to LNZ tho. in saying that they think Nip brought him up to early
[8:17:31] <frems> 40% loss didn't help since that was a cluster and his first event with nip, right?
[8:17:32] <ggTeaTime> I think it's a different position when you're a goat conversation piece (even if I don't think so). If you say you want to be the best people take you much more seriously
[8:17:33] <irratattz> to rush b is my real test
[8:17:35] <CommieWolverine> I want to continue to be the #3 ratted player in the world. I love it here. Its comfy -Dev1ce

[8:17:54] <hamush> rez kind of did nice on mirage
[8:17:56] <b0t_papa> Excuse me fl0m I am peepoIQ how dare you expect things from me
[8:17:57] <DeDapt> g2 heroic thoughts?
[8:17:58] <nilreM4> WHY WASNT LNZ SCREAMING HOLD ON THE MIC WHILE HE KREPT BEHIND THEM JUNGLE
[8:17:58] <lordoutlaw> lost all my channel points in tariks stream so i left lol
[8:18:02] <sol1taire> LNZ did very well considering it was his first major
[8:18:03] <mamluku> maybe nip makes a play for brollan and krimz @fl0m
[8:18:07] <generic_gaming_245> rez did nothing, device should have been better, and plopski did as expected... badly
[8:18:10] <luckinout1> what would you do to fix Nip?
[8:18:15] <hamush> ye cool
[8:18:15] <theodoric98> i blame linus tech tips for his terrible review of the game
[8:18:15] <b0t_papa> generic_gaming_245 ?
[8:18:16] <faidros> Device has been top 5 for god knows how many years on HLTV, has 4 Majors, two Major MVPs, 19 total MVPs, Intel Grand Slam, a record 10 Tier 1 trophies in a calendar year. s1mple is better individually, but device the greater career so far.
[8:18:17] <jackther1pper69> g2 v heroic thoughts?
[8:18:22] <faidros> And that’s that!
[8:18:28] <sjoerdtheman> yeah
[8:18:30] <sweminy> REZ major run FEelsBadMan
[8:18:31] <mavesuvius> NiP Dupreeh??
[8:18:32] <Xschmise> LNZ had 6 kills and 43 ADR in 26 rounds of Mirage
[8:18:33] <Zayzel> smooyaaaaa
[8:18:33] <luc_53> NiP went from 40% loss online to 100% loss on stage, gg
[8:18:35] <xsinkee> mezii
[8:18:36] <shiningtyguy> @XeeVzz nothing to the public but some people want to prove to themselves that they caould do it elsewhere, not saying thats what hes doing
[8:18:36] <generic_gaming_245> @b0t_papa its true
[8:18:36] <Phil_McKrevis> damn dude. Nice haircut!
[8:18:37] <sjoerdtheman> OI BRUV 3Head
[8:18:39] <thegunarse> fl0m called me stupid peepoAngy
[8:18:40] <lakupipo> nip need krimzzzzz!
[8:18:41] <CommieWolverine> Is it basically all a formality that -LNZ +Dupreeh?
[8:18:42] <random_factz> smooyaHOPE
[8:18:46] <sol1taire> NIP might win BLAST Global Finals even after every1 shitting on them ____
[8:18:46] <sweminy> the BRUVS KEKW
[8:18:47] <moosE3knucklE> Device and ReZ not showing up. LnZ not really being ready yet and Plop is just not the awnser is why this team looked so flat
[8:18:48] <SupraUK_> smooya suprau1K
[8:18:51] <ggTeaTime> I don't know why Rez is painted as the real second star anyway. It's really weird to me.
[8:18:52] <MadeInLevi> when we got a gold coin guys?
[8:18:54] <dankiyy> nip is tasty for new released danes

[8:19:37] <cssteve> rez was playing so good pre major
[8:19:40] <sol1taire> watch NIP win global blast finals
[8:19:40] <XeeVzz> @shiningtyguy i dont think he wants to prove he is a hard carry , he always says he is not that type of guy because of his style
[8:19:42] <random_factz> smooyaWAT he is calm like I have never seen from a LAD
[8:19:46] <moosE3knucklE> @hamush LNZ is just not ready for all this yet.... he was rushed i think and i hope it doesnt hurt his career

[8:20:32] <sol1taire> @fl0m  i just came back from Big Bend National Park - have you been?
[8:20:33] <basedjumper> @Xschmise hahahaha uhhhh
[8:20:38] <sweminy> NiP DUPREEH CONFIRMED???
[8:20:39] <ggTeaTime> He's the second star of the roster yes. I meant that don't think he should be a second star on the team though. I just prefer having someone else be second star.
[8:20:43] <moosE3knucklE> not everyone is gonna have a perfect tourney and unfortunately ReZ had the bad tourney at the major
[8:20:44] <shiningtyguy> @XeeVzz yea Id agree
[8:20:53] <Xschmise> @basedjumper based on HOPE I feel ya, but G2 was always gonna take that
[8:20:54] <Darkagespawn> Actually
[8:20:58] <hamush> @moose3knuckle agreed, maybe should have sticked with ztr or just got a proper upgrade, also, replace plopski

[8:21:01] <Kkillerdude> I think it wasn't just NIP playing bad, G2 have been saving strats since fucking months - they literally threw the blast event
[8:21:01] <jazzkaj> magisk to faze instead of oluf
[8:21:02] <Toldam01> you got your take on the new Astralis roster on YouTube @fl0m ?
[8:21:07] <random_factz> I was hoping Plop would do well , I even had him in my fantasy Sadge
[8:21:13] <etnax123> Heroic over G2?
[8:21:16] <VoinkRotmg> do you think gambit will destroy furia tomorw?
[8:21:18] <moosE3knucklE> no no i agree
[8:21:27] <Kkillerdude> dude you are crazy picking heroic over G2
[8:21:28] <z1c3n> I should have went heroic I was so back and forth on that game
[8:21:36] <Weebs1997> I got heroic over g2 too but now I’m nervous lol @fl0m
[8:21:36] <luc_53> WHY DONT I HAVE A GOLD COIN VALVE..... I DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT AND YOU SAY I DONT PUT PICKS THROUGH
[8:21:41] <Xschmise> I think G2 will clap heroic
[8:21:43] <moosE3knucklE> I Agree @fl0m its just... he had his bad tourney at the WORST POSSIBLE TIME
[8:21:49] <sjoerdtheman> KEKPOINT
[8:21:50] <CommieWolverine> No other CS event is going to get 250,000 concurrent consistently for a QF match on the main stream
[8:21:54] <sweminy> @luc_53 forget to update picks?
[8:21:54] <Xschmise> Niko needs literally 5 good rounds and G2 Wins
[8:21:57] <Darkagespawn> mine didn`t too :S
[8:21:58] <random_factz> GabeN NO
[8:22:04] <Kkillerdude> G2 will clap Heroics ass cheeks in Avicii arena in front of the crowd
[8:22:08] <splitsky_> scammed smileW
[8:22:08] <SupraUK_> @ggTeaTime "I don't know why Rez is painted as the real second star" and "He's the second star of the roster yes" are antithetical to one-another my guy
[8:22:10] <hamush> niko said fuck it and won it
[8:22:12] <sol1taire> have you been to Reno?
[8:22:20] <d4nger911> Navi winning major now would confirm diamond for u given both picks right for today
[8:22:21] <mamluku> now u only need navi to win it all @fl0m
[8:22:21] <Darkagespawn> Volvo! Madge
[8:22:29] <moosE3knucklE> @hamush and GTR wasnt it.. either its like Flom said... they brought in Device and didnt really put the right pieces around him to win the biggest tourney.
[8:22:30] <SupraUK_> and my legends pickems are kil sadgeBusinessTime
[8:22:31] <luc_53> thank god i'm not alone
[8:22:33] <SupraUK_> no diamond for me
[8:22:34] <ShreddedCheeks> i had NiP over G2 Sadge i was a believer
[8:22:35] <thegunarse> new csgo update @fl0m
[8:22:35] <Drage_2000> !res
[8:22:35] <Nightbot> 2560×1440 16:9
[8:22:39] <SupraUK_> i want furia to win the major so i'm not alone
[8:22:43] <sjoerdtheman> tbh i just hope navi wins the tourney
[8:22:50] <BobiHouzmeister> man if niko keeps playing the way he does i have them over heroic
[8:22:51] <Kkillerdude> I hate that Navi is looking stronger than G2
[8:22:54] <Advorange> i hope g2 makes the final
[8:22:55] <sjoerdtheman> SupraUK_ KEKW
[8:22:55] <basedjumper> NiKo terrifies me KEKW
[8:22:56] <sol1taire> Heroic can handle NIKO better than NIP
[8:22:56] <yobtih> I have G2 in the final
[8:22:56] <sweminy> hampus needs to be a rifler mid-round caller. EE MAG IN
[8:22:56] <SupraUK_> KEKPOINT i have g2 to win over heroic
[8:22:58] <luc_53> niko was just better
[8:22:59] <Krims0n__> niko as major MVP?
[8:23:02] <random_factz> monkaW 1TAP niko
[8:23:03] <Toldam01> Niko can't do that 2 matches in a row. no way
[8:23:05] <yobtih> G2 vs Furia
[8:23:06] <Rinm> he was just better
[8:23:06] <dbz1h> navi loses tomorrow
[8:23:07] <Kkillerdude> fucking Simple never goes inconsistent
[8:23:09] <djues333> @fl0m imagine vit furia quarters instead KEKW
[8:23:09] <luckinout1> Whoever wins Navi / Vitality goes all the way
[8:23:12] <Gekko125> Complexity should just pick up a brazil team with cold and peacemaker. maybe +Saffe?
[8:23:12] <mamluku> u got no hope on vitality upseting navi @fl0m
[8:23:13] <d4nger911> imagine zywoo hard carries to semi
[8:23:13] <falaflani> stavn, refrezh and teses looking good though
[8:23:14] <AJJay> Hows your fantasy team?
[8:23:14] <sol1taire> not saying heroic will necessarily win but they can manage niko better than nip
[8:23:14] <vontaro0> during last 15 months gambit played navi 37 times, they won 19 tines navi 18
[8:23:14] <Darkagespawn> G2 Navi Final - S1mple go kill - navi wins FeelsGoodMan
[8:23:16] <dbz1h> s1mple to NIP
[8:23:17] <vontaro0> fun fact
[8:23:17] <soulboundx> But NiP tho
[8:23:17] <2020numbers> @SupraUK_ ?? already? i had nip through to semis but if navi win the major i can still get it haHAA COPIUM
[8:23:19] <faidros> Heroic beats G2
[8:23:20] <icecoldnew> i think it will be g2 vs navi in final
[8:23:20] <moosE3knucklE> Niko looked scary but... Amanek is SOOOO INCONSISTENT on the AWP... against Heroic he will struggle
[8:23:24] <moosE3knucklE> And JackZ
[8:23:26] <Xschmise> @fl0m the fact is, that NiKo needs 5 good rounds in that BO3 and that secures G2
[8:23:26] <etnax123> I think Heroic struggled while G2 just went thru NIP @fl0m
[8:23:27] <luc_53> i'm in so much trouble coin wise
[8:23:28] <jamejacobs> g2 wins against heroic imo
[8:23:28] <Kkillerdude> hahahahaha
[8:23:30] <cssteve> i chose g2 over heroic in my pickems lol
[8:23:32] <KriidRS> Vitality gunna win and ruin everyones pickems OMEGALUL
[8:23:33] <Toldam01> I think Gambit will take it.
[8:23:33] <puplice> NAVI vs Furia for sure
[8:23:34] <yobtih> I have furia vitality
[8:23:35] <hamush> @moose3knuckle yeah ztr, he was alright and maybe additional time would actually help him get a bit more stable and consistent
[8:23:35] <Aderu__> furia + vit = Sadge
[8:23:36] <yaJgnizamA> G2 vs Vitality for the final would be awesome
[8:23:38] <vent_diver> would be a clownfiesta at that point LUL
[8:23:39] <yobtih> In my pickems
[8:23:40] <soulboundx> Imagine not being a big dick NiP fan and placing them first
[8:23:40] <SupraUK_> 2020numbers i got 4/5 in legends
[8:23:40] <Kkillerdude> furia vitality means G2 wins the major
[8:23:42] <harryparadise> Gamibt still have to win yet
[8:23:43] <Bondziornooooo> Am i the only one that didnt got point for chosing teams?
[8:23:43] <chromaticc_> my pickems are the exact same monkaW all i need is for navi to win the major and diamond is secured
[8:23:44] <sol1taire> the upset of this major will be FURIA beating Gambit.
[8:23:44] <yaJgnizamA> French Civil War
[8:23:45] <angusbacon_> 98 percent of pickems have navi
[8:23:47] <ggTeaTime> NaVi gambit is going to be even better because Gambit get an "easier" quarterfinal to get a bit more warmed up to the stage if they can stomp it
[8:23:47] <rivv3> if you make the wrong major winner you lose the diamond?
[8:23:48] <Scape000> If vitality wins there will be verry few diamond coins in this world @fl0m
[8:23:48] <icecoldnew> G2 VS NAVI FINAL
[8:23:49] <2020numbers> @SupraUK_ oh sadgeBusinessTime
[8:23:56] <stormshitman> he has to do s1mple ting
[8:23:58] <Kkillerdude> zywoo won't pop off
[8:23:59] <faidros> Heroic almost beat Navi on Ancient. They’ll beat G2 in a BO3.
[8:24:00] <stormshitman> *things

[8:24:09] <hamush> zywoo literally carried them, shoxy though, feels bad
[8:24:13] <soulboundx> !penissize
[8:24:14] <Nightbot> soulboundx has a 13 mm peter.
[8:24:18] <Darkagespawn> fl0mDoubters CurseLit fl0mBelievers
[8:24:19] <justMarss11> He has to POP off you know
[8:24:20] <Kkillerdude> heroic will suck ass with a straw against g2
[8:24:20] <yaJgnizamA> zyw0o needs to enter the matrix
[8:24:21] <Scape000> Zywoo would have to be soooo impactful to beat navi
[8:24:24] <hamush> he seems to be the weakest link
[8:24:25] <mamluku> upper bracket is scary, but if u want to be the best, gotta beat the best
[8:24:25] <luc_53> navi need to leave their whole team in the hotel for vita to win
[8:24:28] <soulboundx> I told you, Big Dick 13mm NiP fan
[8:24:36] <Krisy07> who won?
[8:24:36] <soulboundx> 13mm is Giant bro
[8:24:37] <Krisy07> PLEASE
[8:24:38] <hhooclan345> zywoo wont pop off for the pickems otherwise i am gonna poach him
[8:24:40] <Dantyee> I think zywoo would have to pop off AND at least one of s1mple, bit and electronic have to fall off
[8:24:42] <icecoldnew> IF NAVI SCREW UP AND GOES OUT BEFORE FINAL, G2 WILL WIN THE MAJOR THEN FOR SURE :)
[8:24:43] <yobtih> Shox and Apex in a major playoff. They turning up
[8:24:47] <stormshitman> It for sure is
[8:24:47] <Krisy07> Update me im on phone and my shit HLTV wont work

[8:24:59] <Kkillerdude> yeah if Navi loses before finals, niko gets the major
[8:25:00] <moosE3knucklE> @hamush idk.. i dont think they woulda won with either GTR or LNZ... i just worry about LNZ mentally being so young and having that bad of a performance in front of the home crowd
[8:25:03] <BobiHouzmeister> its always a good series when navi play vitality
[8:25:03] <yaJgnizamA> its that he said that in public
[8:25:04] <Scape000> If Navi losses to Vitality, S1mple might resing
[8:25:05] <soulboundx> @djues333 So it begins
[8:25:08] <cloud_surfer_csgo> heroice poo poo
[8:25:09] <sweminy> if RPK is le tank, ZyWoo is the APC, 'cause he's got the team in his backpack and he's taking them places xD
[8:25:10] <fredohsm> he goes to apex for advice: yeah your gonna need to hard carry KEKW
[8:25:17] <d4nger911> True
[8:25:18] <sol1taire> this is the best major we've had in 2 years
[8:25:20] <Kuroitan> Also the only major we've had in a while
[8:25:23] <hamush> G2 looses major final due to forgetting to defuse the bomb
[8:25:24] <Darkagespawn> @Kkillerdude TRUE SeemsGood
[8:25:25] <Xschmise> If vitality pops off in map 1 Simple will tilt
[8:25:25] <dankiyy> no really? only been 2 years KappaRoss
[8:25:27] <moosE3knucklE> TRUEEEEE
[8:25:27] <mamluku> i wish it had double elims
[8:25:29] <d4nger911> Major had sick matchups
[8:25:32] <euECHO> loads of people been saying this is the worst major weve ever seen
[8:25:33] <icecoldnew> yes its a good major but the boston final 2018 was the most insane one in history for sure
[8:25:34] <Toldam01> the only time Zywoo get pressured is during interviews
[8:25:34] <justinimii> Insane games today!!! Best major in years!
[8:25:37] <falaflani> matches are so good you forget about PGL's production
[8:25:43] <Gour204> jack eichel to the knights w000000
[8:25:44] <moosE3knucklE> Heroic take G2...
[8:25:46] <luc_53> best major in 2 years lul
[8:25:46] <diamonndcc> Zywoo and s1mple will always be just a step ahead of device... just in tearm of how much they can help a team in the hard moments, not when they are doing well
[8:25:46] <sol1taire> I attended the cs go major in Atlanta and came out of the arena sick with a cold :-(
[8:25:46] <dankiyy> double elim in playoffs WTFF
[8:25:48] <justinimii> I wish LIQUID was tomorrow
[8:25:48] <sweminy> @Toldam01 the freya interviews xD
[8:25:50] <luckinout1> even though my fav teams are out im still looking forward to whats to come
[8:25:53] <AMutantCookie> FUCK VEGAS KEEP STEALING PLAYERS FROM ME
[8:25:54] <hamush> single eliminations always
[8:25:56] <cloud_surfer_csgo> are you sad to lose tuch or more excited for eichel
[8:25:59] <Nightbot> Latest video: fl0m CS:GO PGL Stockholm Major 2021 Pick'Ems - Champions Stage - https://youtu.be/Xyzh-xLzqS8
[8:25:59] <shiningtyguy> playoffs should never be double elim ino
[8:26:03] <Doccy> majors are about spectacle
[8:26:04] <hamush> double is kind of too forgiving
[8:26:07] <sh0whell> is the final BO3? or BO5?
[8:26:08] <XeeVzz> @fl0m what do you think of furia chances to beat gambit
[8:26:09] <Doccy> imo
[8:26:12] <yobtih> You getting off?
[8:26:13] <euECHO> @sh0whell bo 3
[8:26:14] <Steelnex> olof tweet
[8:26:14] <justMarss11> Double elim in playoffs would be boring
[8:26:17] <Krisy07> @fl0m If possible raid your brother krisy xd im bout to stream faceit games
[8:26:18] <jackther1pper69> BO3
[8:26:18] <deadwing97> you won't get upsets
[8:26:18] <chromaticc_> fix the tech issues and this major becomes Pog / 10
[8:26:20] <JxFriz> I haven't gotten to watch every match but pretty much every match I've watched has been crazy good. Even challenger stage was good games
[8:26:22] <thegunarse> !1deag
[8:26:23] <Nightbot> thegunarse pops a 1deag on anotherttvviewer 1TAP
[8:26:26] <dbz1h> major should be bo1 short games
[8:26:27] <moosE3knucklE> Double elim with bo5 final with a map advantage to upper bracket is good... cause its basically a bo3 lol
[8:26:28] <sweminy> +1 on everything mattering more
[8:26:36] <ggTeaTime> Double elim is ALSO really intense at TI every time even for viewership
[8:26:37] <Toldam01> @sweminy *shrugs shoulder* no. :D
[8:26:38] <domsbr> Pls show pick ems again
[8:26:51] <AMutantCookie> !pickems
[8:26:51] <Nightbot> You must not be subscribed to fl0m's youtube. That's pretty Crungo . heres the playoff pickems video i guess https://youtu.be/Xyzh-xLzqS8
[8:26:54] <ggTeaTime> Like TI is still baller as fuck with double elim hype wise
[8:26:57] <DeJong14> @domsbr check his youtube
[8:26:57] <thegunarse> @domsbr check !youtube
[8:27:01] <LowRatedHighlander> !pickems domsbr
[8:27:01] <Nightbot> You must not be subscribed to fl0m's youtube. That's pretty Crungo . heres the playoff pickems video i guess https://youtu.be/Xyzh-xLzqS8
[8:27:04] <LowRatedHighlander> look there
[8:27:05] <sweminy> @Toldam01 so fucking wholesome :')
[8:27:10] <domsbr> Thanksis
[8:27:14] <sol1taire> agreed
[8:27:14] <ikingbeann> ikingbeann subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! monthly tax has been paid
[8:27:14] <Techno> - ikingbeann just re-subscribed for 10 months! fl0mPog
[8:27:15] <hamush> all european cups are single eliminations, no forgiving at all
[8:27:16] <diamonndcc> love it too
[8:27:19] <mamluku> yeah, major is a bitch
[8:27:19] <Scape000> @fl0m But I dont think it is putting the best teams through
[8:27:23] <sol1taire> those BO1s are intense.
[8:27:23] <luc_53> ITS SO SCARY
[8:27:26] <moosE3knucklE> you cant make mistakes
[8:27:32] <yobtih> And we still got all top 5 teams in the top 8
[8:27:34] <Kurintoi> Columbian bowtie cut throat Kappa
[8:27:35] <random_factz> Actually bo5 double elem is the more accurate for the best cs Kapp
[8:27:36] <d4nger911> Don't care about g2 win, glad dev1ce lost
[8:27:36] <yobtih> Which is crazy
[8:27:39] <sol1taire> BO1 gives a chance for breakout teams like CPH flames
[8:27:42] <hhooclan345> i will call putin to talk to macron so that zywoo wouldnt pop off
[8:27:43] <jwhiskey7> Fl0m we luv ya
[8:27:48] <sweminy> the major being this cutthroat is great, puts pressure on the players
[8:27:55] <hamush> never felt so intense watching G2 BO1
[8:28:04] <jackther1pper69> no Hunden,  no win for heroic against g2
[8:28:12] <Darkagespawn> monkaW Pog Clap
[8:28:12] <Toldam01> I've think this format is awesome. seeding could be better tho @fl0m
[8:28:19] <maybebzrk> i think the format has been great just the initial seeding was crap
[8:28:22] <falaflani> major is unique no need to change the format. also encourages people to play competitive
[8:28:22] <iVex> FUCKFL0M
[8:28:23] <Nightbot> FUCKFL0M
[8:28:23] <moosE3knucklE> you legit have such little wiggle room in Groups to make mistakes and then in playoffs you CANNOT make a mistake
[8:28:26] <ggTeaTime> Yeah but wouldn't you rather have the chance of a lower bracket run or a grand finals rematch
[8:28:27] <sol1taire> thanks to BO1 cs go fans now know who nikodooz is
[8:28:27] <Togepi_007> what's the deal with coins not upgrading to gold? mine's still at silver
[8:28:32] <MeterMaid1> it has been really good games this major
[8:28:36] <justMarss11> Do you think if NaVi meet G2 in the final, that it will be a close game or a stomp?
[8:28:37] <Darkagespawn> NODDERS
[8:28:37] <random_factz> the groups was very good
[8:28:37] <Swap_gg> where gold coin
[8:28:53] <moosE3knucklE> @ggTeaTime oh yeah
[8:28:53] <luc_53> copenhagen flames would've beaten g2 HAHAHAHAHAH
[8:28:53] <d4nger911> Navi would stomp g2 if they meet in finals
[8:28:53] <Uwotm08> The Major can get away with the current system because it has 24 teams, of course. And it has 24 teams because it's a nice chunk of sticker income for all involved orgs. We wouldn't want to have it any different.
[8:28:55] <hamush> I liked minors more, hope they come back
[8:29:01] <naf1m> those suck
[8:29:02] <Nightbot> fl0m and GeT_RiGhT now have partnered costream rights with no delay watching the main stream. https://twitter.com/pglesports/status/1454063718229319683
[8:29:04] <kylegrhm> Just dont choke
[8:29:06] <yobtih> C9 came back 0-2
[8:29:09] <sweminy> this is not super mario where you have extra lives in absurdum
[8:29:12] <XeeVzz> single elim at major is too exciting idc
[8:29:15] <random_factz> 4Head just don't choke
[8:29:20] <yobtih> Technically there is a lower bracket
[8:29:31] <budgetwaifu> !1deag
[8:29:32] <Nightbot> budgetwaifu pops a 1deag on grodan_boll_ 1TAP
[8:29:34] <harryparadise> if your losing 0-3 surly there shouldnt be a lower bracket
[8:29:37] <cssteve> I'm assuming Flom already spoke on the Konfig, BlameF move? Where can i find in vod?
[8:29:38] <sol1taire> thinking of going to Bryce Cnayon - have you been?
[8:29:42] <hamush> sticker situation sucks though, missing out on so much
[8:29:45] <Madfish2021> Single elimination in the EU is a standard for traditional sports also
[8:29:47] <ThundaCatzHOOO> it's a perfect setup because yoy have a chance to recover a loss in groups. plenty of chances to come back
[8:29:50] <deadwing97> most important that final is BO3 not fucking BO5
[8:29:52] <hhooclan345> calling putin
[8:29:53] <mamluku> @fl0m even team spirit
[8:29:54] <hhooclan345> ...
[8:29:55] <Pr0phetic> its been pretty lit tbh, even though there's not as many  recognizable players as usual for me personally @fl0m
[8:29:57] <Defiler99> The coins don't upgrade until the complete 'next' phase is complete. So just because you may have qualified for the points for this bracket, it doesn't apply until every team has played.

[8:29:57] <hhooclan345> ......
[8:29:59] <sweminy> lower brackets in the major feels a bit like milking it.
[8:29:59] <random_factz> I think the 2 groups stages makes it so you don't need a lower bracket
[8:29:59] <lordextraordinary> This system creates better players. Pressure pressure pressure
[8:30:01] <ggTeaTime> Idk man, I just think that the major having more matches between teams is really good because the major has that different level of importance
[8:30:02] <Thugs_Bunny268> just dont lose 4Head
[8:30:05] <deadwing97> bo5 for final is just boring and shit
[8:30:09] <mamluku> last 3 winners of international came from lower bracket @fl0m
[8:30:25] <hamush> bo5 too much, i dont have 5hrs for a game
[8:30:27] <sloveCS> you could say the matches are more important in single elim
[8:30:27] <steth427> I missed map 3?
[8:30:28] <moosE3knucklE> I love Double Elim with B05 Finals with a map advantage to Upper bracket. cause it makes the Bo5 feel like a B03 with the upper team getting to really push the map pool and the lower team showing something
[8:30:31] <yobtih> Gotcha. Meh, I like the system but I’m a Valorant player so I also like pretty colors

[8:30:45] <thegunarse> @yobtih Kissahomie

[8:30:58] <harryparadise> biggest tournament means harder format right?
[8:30:59] <ggTeaTime> No no, I'm saying something else
[8:30:59] <gabagoolx> god the single elim playoffs get me fucking going tho - shit was so nuts watching g2-nip. niko was A BEAST
[8:31:01] <falaflani> true
[8:31:03] <marian_m10> :)
[8:31:06] <icecoldnew> fl0m how you feel about hunters celebration? i see some people are crying on twitter loool xD
[8:31:06] <sol1taire> do you like PGL's styling and HUD theme?
[8:31:09] <Pr0phetic> breaks have also been really short, its nice
[8:31:15] <hamush> els screwed pro league, hated the format
[8:31:19] <espl1ce> single elim is just better for the major
[8:31:19] <Moobot> Please ask a mod before posting links. (@randomdudeq) (warning)
[8:31:21] <XeeVzz> cologne and kato are single elimination though
[8:31:27] <MRmobis1> What changes should nip make next tho?
[8:31:27] <AverageMauo> its also crazy that we have an operation in csgo going on right now too
[8:31:29] <DatOneGuyKai> How's your fantasy stats after today @fl0m?
[8:31:30] <Killie18> But twitch chat is always right :$
[8:31:31] <Kurintoi> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[8:31:33] <randomdudeq> Can i post a g2 tweet pls
[8:31:37] <moosE3knucklE> agreed
[8:31:38] <stormshitman> what did hunter do?
[8:31:38] <maybebzrk> what did hunter do?
[8:31:40] <sol1taire> I absolutely LOVED that hunter move :-)
[8:31:40] <LuckyGun> twitter is always upset KEKW
[8:31:40] <VoinkRotmg> didnt he just put his hand on his ear?
[8:31:40] <eyelend> what did hunter do?
[8:31:44] <moosE3knucklE> its a COMPETITIVE GAME
[8:31:44] <theodoric98> ???
[8:31:46] <TonyGuac> What did he do?
[8:31:48] <SupraUK_> @randomdudeq already been posted here my guy
[8:31:48] <icecoldnew> agree with you hahah its so child like to get mad about that
[8:31:48] <ggTeaTime> I'm saying that I think that BECAUSE the major is generally more important, I prefer seeing different matchup options come up again. Like having eliminated teams play against each other so that you don't have the most specific defined matches
[8:31:49] <AMutantCookie> This is that shitty crossover where sports bleeds in and people get angy
[8:31:50] <sweminy> they should watch overwatch league
[8:31:51] <moosE3knucklE> the players are PASSOINATE
[8:31:52] <cmxc0> is it just me that feels like this major is over in a flash?
[8:31:53] <glow2007> he taunted them but it was just funny
[8:31:55] <Toldam01> I've almost watched every game. I wouldn't be able to that if the format wa
[8:31:55] <theodoric98> what he done??
[8:31:57] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m I was actually offended when hunter did that. I am unsubbing
[8:31:57] <daredev1ltv> same peopple probably want a trophy regardless of the place they get
[8:31:57] <yobtih> Well hunter is NOT welcome in Valorant
[8:31:58] <Cacemen> I people get upset about that they just don't know what competition is about
[8:31:59] <SICK0> he was just signaling that he also had audio issues like the production
[8:32:01] <shiningtyguy> nruh the dude made the i cant hear you expression.....a classic celebration LOL if your mad at tht i dnt know what to say
[8:32:03] <random_factz> BabyRage you can't show feelings of any kind as a pro player
[8:32:03] <randomdudeq> @suprauk_ ok sry
[8:32:04] <theodoric98> WHAT DID HE DO??
[8:32:05] <Defiler99> Hunter held his hand up to his ear as if he was listening hard, and aimed that at the audience.. asking "what do you have to say now?", basically
[8:32:14] <faidros> Swedish fans will actively root against G2 now
[8:32:15] <hhooclan345> word.exe
[8:32:18] <faidros> They say so
[8:32:18] <AMutantCookie> so they want esports to be sports but don't want the fun parts?
[8:32:21] <bl1pblap> the best part of cs is the trashtalk and celebrations
[8:32:21] <Fistagon> hunter taunted the crowd after beating NIP on NIP-picked Inferno
[8:32:21] <originalpirate> SICK0 KEKW
[8:32:26] <g0dSOe> Hunter is very good
[8:32:26] <SparrowR6> fl0mster whats up bbg
[8:32:27] <shakezula_the_mic_rula> those are ppl who lived on the internet their entire life and never played anything competitive on a team
[8:32:28] <horser4dish> hunter showed some testicular fortitude, that's what he did
[8:32:29] <sol1taire> cancel culture
[8:32:38] <sol1taire> this is the world we live in. Everyone is perfect and polite

[8:33:02] <Thugs_Bunny268> so EZ Clap
[8:33:03] <sol1taire> Twitter is an open-air insane aylum
[8:33:05] <basedjumper> The villain of the story
[8:33:06] <captain_skyrus> I don't think it was why so fucking quiet... it was let me listen to your boos now
[8:33:06] <sweminy> the casters even called it out "this turned into a library real quick" or something like that @fl0m
[8:33:07] <random_factz> Ceb did the same thing  at TI , like how is that bad ?
[8:33:07] <plurk> don't they teabag and bm all the time in valorant?
[8:33:08] <AMutantCookie> Has nobody seen jojo in game? KEKW
[8:33:10] <theodoric98> yeah see what happens when ur too patriotic
[8:33:11] <Abioticcc> i want fans fighting each other blood all over like ...
[8:33:11] <DesireGuy> he def made sure that fans won't cheer for G2 in semis :D
[8:33:15] <ForbiddenCake> It made me like him more
[8:33:15] <moosE3knucklE> great moment 100% and i was cheering for NiP
[8:33:17] <Toldam01> nah Fl0m. emotions in CS is wrong :D
[8:33:17] <luc_53> that's what lan is about
[8:33:19] <kylegrhm> how many challenges complete for golden coin? should we not have it by now
[8:33:24] <SupraUK_> @glow2007 don't worry about it, you probably weren't here
[8:33:25] <BalumaNotSoHot> no flom lets just kill the sports in esports, so it just becomes E lmao Kap
[8:33:25] <giraffemofo> yea g2 was clearly the better team unfortunately
[8:33:28] <Rinm> gets the people going
[8:33:30] <g0dSOe> Grand final going to be g2 vs Navi mark my words;)
[8:33:31] <haprd> "people who get easily offended deserve to be offended"
[8:33:33] <TheRenegadeRonin> Every story needs a villain @fl0m
[8:33:35] <ggTeaTime> @plurk That's baby bm. That's not sporting rivalry type bm
[8:33:36] <glow2007> @SupraUK_ ah lol
[8:33:36] <dieandgopls> And it is not like he will insult the other team, it is just part of the bm of the game, fun stuff, like twizt 'sit the fuck down'
[8:33:37] <lil_unz> time to see UKCS return with Fnatic and its slightly majority UK roster
[8:33:40] <visiblescout> was it that or was it the fact that the grenade thrown hit 3 players and the crowd went wild and gave the play away and he still clutched?
[8:33:42] <AMutantCookie> If NIP won inferno there was a chance
[8:33:42] <HOLLYYYWOOD> I agree definitely gets you invested
[8:33:43] <mamluku> now time for everybody to cheer for s1mple
[8:33:43] <shakezula_the_mic_rula> NIP is not good..cant be sad for them..they are vitality junior, top tier awper & a solid igl, but they each have a player who is useless. lnz and kyojin
[8:33:44] <Cacemen> I played sports all my life and one of the best feelings is winning when the crowd is against you and feeling the silence
[8:33:48] <chromaticc_> cant be emotional in cs paapoWeird
[8:33:51] <mmito> @theodoric98 lol nothing wrong with being patriotic?
[8:33:51] <icecoldnew> hahha yes some people seriously crying on twitter about it
[8:33:51] <Defiler99> The coins will upgrade when the next set of 'tasks' completes.. so all of these best-of-8 matches will need to finish.
[8:33:54] <gosubloody> he has every right ti di that
[8:33:56] <Kurintoi> Dev1ce Cruise going to have to get his reading all again and shit shoots
[8:33:56] <giraffemofo> i just wish it went to 3 maps

[8:34:28] <sweminy> as a Swede I'm disappointed that NiP didn't make it, but I'd rather have EPIC games when I go to the arena on saturday
[8:34:30] <mamluku> tomorrow is gonna be firee
[8:34:31] <MeterMaid1> sadly crowd was a little bit quiet, but nip also got stomped
[8:34:33] <maybebzrk> wasnt it at epl that they were yelling and screming between rounds anyway when shit happnened no one said anything there

[8:36:36] <moosE3knucklE> he did alot of damage but they killed him
[8:36:36] <stormshitman> The entire premise is being complained about what world do we live in
[8:36:36] <daredev1ltv> when my ass is rumbling I go to the bathroom
[8:36:37] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m you never played at a lan. you dont know the experience PepeSpit

[8:36:49] <chromaticc_> c OMEGALUL vid monkaS
[8:36:53] <g0dSOe> I was cheering for VP to win against heroic, feeldsbad jame dont have a good day :/
[8:36:55] <sol1taire> what does a simp mean?
[8:36:56] <TooBakedPotato> @fl0m  chat doesn’t realize sound is physical 😂😂😂
[8:37:11] <p0da> watch what now?
[8:37:17] <wNdrVisionTV> what documentary??
[8:37:20] <jwhiskey7> link to docu?
[8:37:21] <MeterMaid1> what did u watch 10 times?
[8:37:24] <Thugs_Bunny268> the fact that the crowd didnt dive away the first oranges boost was so good
[8:37:26] <shiningtyguy> @sol1taire its slang for pimp
[8:37:26] <d4nger911> @TooBakedPotato Is maths related to science?
[8:37:27] <random_factz> KEKPOINT OG True sight simp
[8:37:34] <Thugs_Bunny268> give*
[8:37:35] <Notifly> Crowd is basically a 6th sense
[8:37:46] <sol1taire> @shiningtyguy I only see ****
[8:37:46] <random_factz> it real is very Pog
[8:37:50] <Redalict> I made my wife watch the 2018 after you showed it on stream.
[8:37:57] <TooBakedPotato> @d4nger911 idk I need to ask my geometry teacher :)
[8:38:01] <visiblescout> @toobakedpotato  sound is actually your ears converting vibrations in the air.  which is why a tree that falls in the woods with no one around doesn't make a sound.
[8:38:01] <on33_chan> !age
[8:38:01] <Nightbot> 29 (de_ancient)
[8:38:04] <sweminy> @TooBakedPotato insert meme of "if those kids could read"
[8:38:06] <Scorpotic> is dad sending us to bed?
[8:38:08] <toxinfragg> !commands
[8:38:08] <Nightbot> https://nightbot.tv/t/fl0m/commands
[8:38:13] <moosE3knucklE> That heroic VP game was pretty good tho. Buster man.
[8:38:15] <shakezula_the_mic_rula> i dont care about any videogame besides cs..ill wait for a cs style of videos
[8:38:17] <random_factz> FeelsStrongMan makes me cry every time
[8:38:29] <Cacemen> I have no idea about dota2 ant loved does documentarys
[8:38:43] <h4teddota3> BNB T SHIRT WTF UR COOL
[8:38:44] <h4teddota3> pog i want one
[8:38:46] <moosE3knucklE> Buster at major's man.. that guy does step shit up at the major
[8:38:55] <TooBakedPotato> @sweminy  hahahahaha
[8:38:56] <ash03012000> did score eSports not make a video that StarCraft has done the best job about stages and crowd?
[8:38:57] <SupraUK_> @h4teddota3 the shirt is cool, fl0m probably isn't
[8:38:58] <Uwotm08> Soundproofing is an illusion.
[8:39:00] <random_factz> FeelsStrongMan ceb speatches
[8:39:13] <Redalict> docs made me want to play dota2 then playing dota 2 made me want to not
[8:39:14] <d4nger911> @h4teddota3 don't u dare
[8:39:16] <jwhiskey7> I quite liked the Overwatch approach - literally let the players do whatever
[8:39:18] <stormshitman> esl on the best booths in the scene I'd pay to see that shitfest
[8:39:18] <g0dSOe> What was the name of the videos ?!
[8:39:19] <Nightbot> fl0m and GeT_RiGhT now have partnered costream rights with no delay watching the main stream. https://twitter.com/pglesports/status/1454063718229319683
[8:39:23] <sweminy> you can only soundproof by cutting off airflow completely, then you still have vibrations. kids need jesus and physics lessons.
[8:39:25] <Kurintoi> Are those a black pair of boxers on the floor?
[8:39:28] <SupraUK_> @g0dSOe True Sight
[8:39:29] <kj_z1n0u> EMBRACE THE HYPE FFS
[8:39:31] <DavieWhy> Was there an issue with sound during the G2-NIP game?
[8:39:31] <DTHbyCILLITbang> DTHbyCILLITbang subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[8:39:31] <Techno> - DTHbyCILLITbang just re-subscribed for 30 months! fl0mPog
[8:39:32] <Uwotm08> It's partly making more white noise so the crowd is less understandable, yeah.
[8:39:37] <DavieWhy> Just got back
[8:39:39] <chancehance> imma kiss you fl0m
[8:39:42] <johnny_legless> why shouldn't the players feed off the crowd??  they do in literally every other sport in the world??
[8:39:43] <Kurintoi> ohhh shoe booty!
[8:39:45] <g0dSOe> @suprauk_ thank u bro
[8:39:45] <LuckyGun> yeah blizzard started choking on production for overwatch tho - right when they finally got it going well
[8:39:49] <luc_53> what's the go with the gold coin @fl0m ?
[8:39:50] <kj_z1n0u> thats what lans are for
[8:39:53] <CSnubbs> Shoe Condom?
[8:39:56] <F1niteCS> KEKW
[8:39:58] <SupraUK_> is the shoe booty a pair of boxers?
[8:39:58] <random_factz> gachiBASS its boxxers
[8:39:59] <moosE3knucklE> They tried to kinda sound proof at the last PGL Major that Gambit WON with dosia. those lil rooms they had for the teams
[8:40:02] <AFugy> fl0mSmorting chat you better be writing this shit down, we're having a test tomorrow
[8:40:02] <visiblescout> I think it may help if they took off x-ray ... like that con play I think NIP kill Niko.  makes no difference to me obviously I'm no pro lol
[8:40:03] <mamluku> @fl0m  any predictions for tomorrow?
[8:40:08] <pinksoda> man nip lost :(
[8:40:11] <Nightbot> We're getting animated sub emotes! But we need suggestions for what you want to see. So we created a form to put your suggestions in: https://forms.gle/3C4sk96BZDdnE1bHA Your suggestion can be wholly original or based on/a rework of an existing emote.
[8:40:16] <random_factz> AFugy monkaW what test
[8:40:21] <jwhiskey7> @luckygun yeah it was a shame, and the meta changed so much, season 1-2 was ace
[8:40:22] <SupraUK_> post it on instagram
[8:40:23] <SupraUK_> chat
[8:40:25] <Togepi_007> @luc_53 yeah dude, mine's stuck at silver too
[8:40:25] <SupraUK_> !instagram
[8:40:25] <Nightbot> https://www.instagram.com/fl0mn0m
[8:40:26] <daredev1ltv> we are gonna see fl0m's legs?
[8:40:32] <daredev1ltv> fl0m has legs?
[8:40:44] <Darkagespawn> @Togepi_007 same
[8:40:48] <shakezula_the_mic_rula> they take xray off at the right moments
[8:40:48] <DavieWhy> feel like fl0m should turn the xray on WeirdEyes
[8:40:52] <randomdudeq> @fl0m where would zonic and magisk go?
[8:40:56] <visiblescout> I think it would just build up more suspense.
[8:41:04] <Doccy> a prediction for tomorrow
[8:41:07] <LuckyGun> @jwhiskey7 it was really cool covering the beginning of that esport, but man it was hard af to watch once goats kicked in, then population started faltering, then production got canned. just...wtf bliz?
