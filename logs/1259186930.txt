[2:04:17] <mukulhayaran> Peach
[2:04:19] <Sm0othhh> all*
[2:04:27] <all3rts3> I don't believe it is significantly affected by smurfing
[2:04:28] <vanillakarl> Fs in the chat?
[2:04:33] <MagicMarker1> matchmaking is so awful that you cant rank up once stuck in silver
[2:04:33] <erk12> i want them to show a total player base distribution to see what valve is most likely looking at
[2:04:34] <Gruglog> Is this weird distribution mostly due to low player base?
[2:04:36] <all3rts3> #s are tooo high
[2:04:37] <F1unkGG> @fl0m You could make players validate accounts with a legit phone number
[2:04:38] <actuaLx> Smurfing kinda done. You need to play a lot of casual games to run comp now
[2:04:39] <SnowPirate> Video link?
[2:04:43] <Sm0othhh> they have report for smurfing and they can ban the account and the Ip as well
[2:04:44] <Gruglog> With higher player base comes more normalized curve?
[2:04:47] <LowRatedHighlander> I think smurfing being a bannable offense is ok now that they‚Äôve added unranked
[2:04:48] <F1unkGG> not many people have more than 1 phone @fl0m
[2:04:49] <Gruglog> Or what explains this
[2:04:52] <Krikkiter> WALLSSSS
[2:04:54] <bluehipp0> I really think one factor is that if you start out, everyone is SO MUCH better than you that a lot of beginners simply give up...
[2:04:55] <Piesito0> NODDERS report everyone
[2:04:59] <asdfk1> i read a theory that valve did it intentionally to combat cheaters
[2:05:02] <LowRatedHighlander> There‚Äôs no reason to have a Smurf account now
[2:05:03] <bluehipp0> so the "real Silver" players don't even get ranked
[2:05:04] <Roberg> fucked by the system
[2:05:06] <Roberg> as per usual
[2:05:08] <Cacemen> or they think they are cheating and then they start cheating
[2:05:10] <ASSDOGZ> Why did I get banned lol
[2:05:10] <TheOnlyWookie> it is MM though
[2:05:15] <TheOnlyWookie> trust no one
[2:05:15] <theotisone1> common silver comment "He's cheating"
[2:05:15] <Sm0othhh> Overwatch can have a look through for smurfing
[2:05:16] <priiide_> Gruglog in theory, but its uncommon that itd be this fucked solely due to sample size
[2:05:23] <Roberg> that silver will die every single round in that case yes

[2:05:26] <Ashas1991> my fellow silver scream cheats every time they meet nova2 or something similar KEKW
[2:05:28] <IraklisMann> In EU your first rank in MG1. So if you are MG1 with 2000 hours, you get teammates MG1 with 100 hours on the game. It's impossible to rank up
[2:05:29] <funkydonuts> I used to be LEM/Supreme. Never below LE. Got Global in the rank shift days. Now Im stuck at Gold Nova 4 despite being on like, 10 win streaks lol
[2:05:33] <all3rts3> Usually, the team with three skilled players wins in MM right now.
[2:05:39] <dolev801> @LowRatedHighlander you mad?
[2:05:41] <DavieWhy> Yeahh, this is not fun at all especially when I'm trying to teach a brand new friend.  It's just not fun and we're kind of stuck just going through mechanics bc there's no way for them to hold their own in a game or even in casual (much less unranked)
[2:05:41] <LowRatedHighlander> Idk how exactly you prove smurfing though
[2:05:44] <mern_eh> Asia has almost as many active players as NA? sheesh
[2:05:50] <Gruglog> @priiide_ That was my thought as well, seems fucked up :P
[2:05:50] <LowRatedHighlander> @dolev801 wait what?
[2:05:51] <bluehipp0> @theotisone1 I literally had a spin bot in my 2nd wingman game...
[2:05:55] <vibrax69> Were the fuck is Africa kekw
[2:06:02] <splitzky__> so I should just VPN to UK/Denmark and play EU mm
[2:06:03] <pioqo> less NA players means less NA competition? @fl0m
[2:06:05] <Sm0othhh> @mern_eh yeah its quite alive
[2:06:06] <dolev801> @LowRatedHighlander lol im joking
[2:06:09] <ItsPatch1> See Fl0m i'm not bad it's the MM distribution
[2:06:09] <rony9> python POG
[2:06:09] <mukulhayaran> monkaW math
[2:06:20] <all3rts3> I was a consistent mg1 until the last operation released for about two years. Now I'm SEM
[2:06:23] <LowRatedHighlander> @dolev801 sorry I‚Äôm still waking up rooW
[2:06:23] <Roberg> what the fook LUL
[2:06:26] <xmarcus2001x> Same problem is in faceit lower ranks
[2:06:29] <nbzness> faceit n/a is not playable.
[2:06:30] <peepers_official> @vibrax69 too low to mention fl0mCry
[2:06:32] <vanillakarl> so bananas
[2:06:35] <bluehipp0> @LowRatedHighlander compare a profile of the PC/hardware setup with other accounts and if you find an exact match, it's  probably a duplicate account...
[2:06:35] <The_Wicked_Wombat> wtf not enough nigerian princes to play
[2:06:39] <erk12> it'd have to be due to cheaters and constant smurfing
[2:06:40] <Cacemen> fl0m I feel like if valve did a rank reset over time this would just happened again
[2:06:42] <KNAPKINAT0R> eu wanna get better NA just fucking throw üòë
[2:06:42] <crocswsocks> no antarctica data CrungoDinkDonk
[2:06:43] <Sm0othhh> CIS should have a specific graph imo
[2:06:48] <vibrax69> @peepers_official True that!
[2:06:50] <Cacemen> maybe if they did seasons like league does
[2:06:53] <Badgerness1> didn't Valve reset all the MM ranks like 5 years ago?
[2:06:54] <mern_eh> NODDERS leetify

[2:07:02] <priiide_> doesnt jojo do coaching on leetify
[2:07:07] <DavieWhy> NODDERS
[2:07:11] <bluehipp0> leetify is cool in general
[2:07:14] <xrayjones1969> if you drop a 40 bomb then you should automatically rank up 2 to 3 ranks
[2:07:15] <w0rmk1ll3r> the cause is NA sucks chat. fl0m just cant admit it and blames cheaters. we see fl0m, an ex pro, miss all the time, how can a silver not?
[2:07:18] <SpecterBoi24> oh god Jojo as a coach
[2:07:18] <jakvah> what was the name of the video, would like to see it again
[2:07:18] <sevengaming_tv> g'morning fl0m MLADY a lady at the office complimented the hoodie MmmHmm
[2:07:20] <Cacemen> but I feel like the rank reset alone wouldn't fix this
[2:07:22] <xmarcus2001x> @knapkinat0r idk why you think like that. I average lvl 6 and the matches are amazing. It‚Äôs just lower ranks that are the problem
[2:07:23] <Roberg> YEP
[2:07:24] <erk12> KEKW imagine having jojo as a coach
[2:07:24] <SoporificPanda> can we watch a happy video now? that one made me big sad

[2:07:47] <DavieWhy> Really don't know what to do since I have a friend who is brand brand new and CS is such a n00b hostile place
[2:07:48] <erk12> praeter15 gotta love when they do that
[2:07:52] <oldGiZ> Watch the slugy, I mean fl0m's reaction to Slugy ?
[2:07:57] <all3rts3> The algo in mm is, you just ranked up to Gn1, cool, go carry a game with four silver1 teammates against a five queue GN/MG squad
[2:07:57] <hobrev> rank reset would not make the problem go away, it might make the problem look better on a short timeframe

[2:08:16] <CSdannyh> @fl0m I only take faceit and esea competitively, and I basically use MM just to mess around, and that is largely part of the reason why.

[2:08:45] <GoIdenBirb> please rank reset aplPray
[2:08:46] <splitzky__> should ranking up be based on skill or simply just winning the game? fl0m
[2:08:46] <Cacemen> @Destructoid5858 yes, the cheaters a better anti-cheat would help but the smurfs is really hard to fix
[2:08:47] <w0rmk1ll3r> the answer is NA gets better fl0m
[2:08:49] <praeter15> forsenCD
[2:08:53] <Destructoid5858> @Cacemen I shit you not you can go into like a flying scoutsman match at 7:00AM CST and get thrown into a game with 3 cheating accounts that will insta kick you

[2:08:55] <Techno> - tander159 just re-subscribed for 42 months! fl0mPog
[2:09:10] <MagicMarker1> Answer is don't touch matchmaking
[2:09:12] <bluehipp0> exactly!
[2:09:20] <bluehipp0> people give up
[2:09:23] <DavieWhy> peepoW I get out of silver?
[2:09:26] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[2:09:42] <Destructoid5858> @Cacemen That's fair. They would have to ban anyone proven to be a smurf. Like their main and alts. Banning the main would discourage them from playing

[2:09:43] <bluehipp0> so the "good" players make up more and more of the ranking system, and the "real silver" players are not even ranked anymore
[2:09:44] <hobrev> the matchmaking experience makes people quit too soon
[2:09:47] <SpecterBoi24> @w0rmk1ll3r I know you're joking but there are cheaters that are hard stuck even though they are hacking
[2:09:48] <xmarcus2001x> Rank reset is not gonna help at all in my opinion since there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of boosted players
[2:09:59] <erk12> true KEKW
[2:10:00] <youarenoobiampro> fl0mG fl0mLurk
[2:10:02] <praeter15> having food catered while playing MM would be great

[2:10:02] <facobb> i gave up :)
[2:10:04] <maT_whiTeho> NA cs players get free stress ball
[2:10:05] <sjoerdtheman> no erk PepeHands

[2:10:09] <peepers_official> ranking up is basically throwing a dice in mm at this point
[2:10:15] <Cacemen> @Destructoid5858 but how do you check for that?
[2:10:23] <MagicMarker1> You can win 30 games in a row and not rank up
[2:10:24] <vanillakarl> fl0m confirms NA snowflakes?
[2:10:24] <waferthinmint> @fl0m so like decent above silver players get frustrated with the experience and quit for a while and rank decay/coming back cold puts them back into silver and boosts the skill level of Silver
[2:10:26] <bluehipp0> I also think, getting 10 wins is kind of a lot for some people...

[2:10:33] <Roberg> man i wish i played in NA, you dont realise how many non english speakers play in EU LUL
[2:10:34] <GoIdenBirb> im just tired at looking at day old accounts top fragging in silver lobbies Sadge
[2:10:35] <Cacemen> @Destructoid5858 exactly, getting this info is really hard
[2:10:36] <skyj_> win 6 in a row: no rankup. lose 2 in a row: derank
[2:10:36] <rony9> sup fl0m how you doin
[2:10:40] <Ashas1991> overall feels like playerbase has returned to monke over a few years, it wasnt this bad before
[2:10:42] <kleindad> @fl0m  What about this:  What about playtime of the region?  Maybe the CSGO rank system skews downward over time if people are playing ranked frequently.  Maybe NA players let their rank lapse, 4 week time, then when they play they start back lower.   Over a long time and lots of people doing this, could skew the ranks lower.   I assume valve could fix this on the backside though.
[2:10:42] <SandwichSundays> it's taken me ~11 wins in a row to rank up the last 3 times
[2:10:45] <bluehipp0> if you lose your first 8 matches, you start thinking that you'll NEVER get 10 wins...
[2:10:45] <DavieWhy> I got discouraged opening a box of yogurt :)
[2:10:46] <ItsPatch1> well I just don't get why you would want someone to know when they'll rank up
[2:10:48] <Roberg> soooo many non-english speakers in EU CS OMEGALUL
[2:10:48] <13relentless> CSGO's ranking system isn't that bad
[2:10:49] <mukulhayaran> i just play dust 2 casual
[2:10:55] <erk12> i just dislike the play 2 then wait 24 hours
[2:10:56] <ChesterWillard> short matches definitely don't give the same elo
[2:10:57] <populatedyesterday> I just hate winning 15-20 games in a row and no rank up is fucked
[2:10:57] <praeter15> mukulhayaran youre disgusting
[2:10:58] <Cacemen> @Destructoid5858 I think the unranked matches help with this
[2:10:58] <WhyNumb_> oh my a train game
[2:10:59] <Jordyiwnl> train pog
[2:11:05] <ItsPatch1> or wouldn't want someone to know when they're going to rank up
[2:11:13] <xmarcus2001x> Yeah for real it‚Äôs so tiring to see 20h players headshot the whole lobby
[2:11:17] <Destructoid5858> @Cacemen you'd have to start using stuff like ips, but even that can be spoofed. Unranked would definitely help

[2:12:36] <bluehipp0> @Destructoid5858 Steam can scan the "hardware profile" of every user, so if any 2 profiles have exactly the same hardware IDs, it's very likely it's a duplicate account, no?
[2:12:44] <Destructoid5858> @Cacemen true. I think it would even help a little if Valve threaten a ban along with banning all the obvious cheaters

[2:14:14] <mukulhayaran> @sevengaming_tv imagine reading copypastas
[2:14:16] <Cacemen> @Destructoid5858 I could help but it wouldn't be a long term solution
[2:14:17] <Destructoid5858> @Cacemen completely valid point.  I'm just a programmer so I don't deal much with the security aspect of application and hardware. Would love to learn more.
[2:14:30] <bluehipp0> @Destructoid5858 it would certainly be WAY less intrusive than a kernel-level anti-cheat!

[3:22:57] <macbookfps> cause the rescue may not accept the pup

[3:23:51] <jokkerbo> wait @fl0m online shelter?  can chat help look?
[3:23:52] <WarG0rd> if the rescue is potty trained it will help the puppy too.
