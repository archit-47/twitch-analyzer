[2:28:52] <bluehipp0> I'm like 127 years old, so nobody wants to advertise for stuff that I buy

[2:29:33] <Uwotm08> It also has to do with what company is willing to pay for ads. If there are none, you won't see an ad, of course (Twitch isn't going to give away adspace for free and won't annoy you with, say, an ad that only makes sense for Americans if you're in Europe.)

[2:30:02] <Mumflr830> ah
[2:30:08] <garrygobulcoque> It’s based on connection. When I’m in the us I get way way more ads. And they us related.
[2:30:08] <LowRatedHighlander> yorue probably less likely to get the ads
[2:30:14] <Uwotm08> I get mostly Amazon Prime and Disney+ ads and the odd game-related one here.

[2:55:11] <camielmarr> I need a new headset for my pc I just got a pc last month and I still have a Xbox headset sorry guys
[2:55:11] <Defirence> mopHi
[2:55:13] <illuhst> GloryD thats what im sayin I hope they can use what they wish but I have zero faith in companies/brands
[2:55:15] <TheAuditorTV> i still like my 144hz
[2:55:19] <eliastheviking> hey fl0m
[2:55:23] <GloryD> pepeLaughing
[2:55:28] <Notech4u> 60Hz till death
[2:55:30] <bluehipp0> why is nobody using 16:10 ?
[2:55:32] <tangoa> @theauditortv it’s plenty for plebes like us
[2:55:37] <ambr0seTV> Why don’t you like 360? I have 144 so don’t understand I’m pleb
[2:55:41] <F1niteCS> 1440x1080 god res don't @ me
[2:55:41] <samurai_067317> flom the best
[2:55:42] <LowRatedHighlander> monkaGIGA
[2:55:46] <spoonyaardvark> @fl0m what monitor do you use?
[2:55:49] <LowRatedHighlander> my eyes!! monkaGIGA
[2:55:50] <WookiePotamus> as some one with shitty eyes blue light sucks for me too
[2:55:52] <MegaGeese> !g7
[2:55:52] <Nightbot> So you're telling me, it has 240hz, 1440p, AND 1 ms response time? this monitor is insane! #ad
[2:55:54] <GloryD> @illuhst if they want players to be comfortable with their peripherals it would be for the best imo
[2:55:54] <Defirence> monkaGIGA
[2:55:59] <nuke_cs> bluehipp0 they arent intellectuals like us
[2:56:01] <bruhandon46> I wear color blind glasses when playing cs
[2:56:03] <surnexx> what side is this?
[2:56:07] <spoonyaardvark> @MegaGeese thanks!
[2:56:13] <Notech4u> smooth answer there fl0m
[2:56:18] <Uwotm08> Not sponsored, just didn't pay for it.
[2:56:18] <Zeyzo_> @ambr0seTV its not a noticeable difference between 240 to 360
[2:56:20] <regan_pain> why does nobody use 16:16 res
[2:56:24] <D1srvpts> %? Boomer
[2:56:24] <Nightbot> Joris says 79%
[2:56:27] <GloryD> @WookiePotamus same pepeLaughing
[2:56:27] <Shinohime> what size ?
[2:56:27] <Raithorn> why not more pros on 16:10?
[2:56:30] <D1srvpts> NODDERS
[2:56:31] <3xide> my benq 240hz does well so Im happy with it
[2:56:34] <Defirence> !1deag
[2:56:34] <Nightbot> Defirence pops a 1deag on ninja0407 1TAP
[2:56:34] <Aegis2saveus> 2k 240 is my shit
[2:56:35] <surnexx> what was that side you where on just now
[2:56:37] <GloryD> !penissize
[2:56:38] <Nightbot> GloryD has a 1 mm peter.
[2:56:43] <illusioooo> !monitor
[2:56:43] <Nightbot> Samsung !G7 27" curved 1440p 240hz
[2:56:44] <bluehipp0> to me 16:10 is a good compromise
[2:56:44] <surnexx> with all mouses monitors etc
[2:56:48] <tangoa> “Oh it’s very expensive” — fl0m
[2:56:50] <camielmarr> Anyone else have a rtx 3060 ? Or higher
[2:56:54] <ambr0seTV> Is 144hz to 240 nearly as noticeable as 60 to 144?
[2:56:58] <surnexx> could you link it?
[2:57:06] <priiide_> you WERE sponsored, but are no longer sponsored is a way to say it
[2:57:06] <DatGoodSir> that's not awkward
[2:57:07] <AFugy> %? 420
[2:57:08] <Nightbot> Joris says 98%
[2:57:08] <Defirence> !vaginadepth
[2:57:08] <Nightbot> Defirence has a 17 mm deep sammich.
[2:57:09] <bluehipp0> @ambr0seTV I seriously doubt it
[2:57:10] <nuke_cs> 16:10 is the best res I will go to my grave with that
[2:57:19] <Defirence> @AFugy CiGrip
[2:57:22] <Dreams_zzz> TRIM THAT STACHHHE
[2:57:22] <Glide15> Do you think it’s comparable to the alien wear 1440 monitor?
[2:57:23] <illuhst> !240 ?
[2:57:23] <Nightbot> 60 to 144 whole different world. 144 to 240 same world but the best possible spot in the new world
