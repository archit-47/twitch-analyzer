[0:16:36] <STatisfacti0n> got pretty sick at the beginning of the semester, fell behind by a lot, fell into a bad depression so the best option for me was to withdraw and then come back next semester but I have to pay off like $6k to the school before I can register again
[0:16:39] <LowRatedHighlander> just look what nightbot said
[0:16:43] <LowRatedHighlander> right after i mesaged

[0:17:08] <bobson300101> oh ahahaha
[0:17:11] <bobson300101> fuck me thats good
[0:17:11] <TheLeonProjectTV> As an Aussie, I’m always so jealous of NA and EU because of their playerbase, our playerbase in oce is fucked up, like one of out best puggers is this guy called g11bs who’s nuts, but he’s only mg1 cause that’s the highest rank one can reasonably get
[0:17:15] <LowRatedHighlander> there ya go CrungoSmile
[0:17:15] <TheLeonProjectTV> It’s super whack

[0:19:30] <weeeegy> that's true, valorant at the moment has only 1 tournament circuit.
[0:19:32] <DropkickGsus> the way i see it there is no real valorant scene yet, give it a couple of years to settle
[0:19:34] <Chezpuf> sleeeeppyyyy MLADY
[0:19:37] <KhaaanUK> Yeah pro players in NA have said players need to stream so teams can actually analyse their gameplay when looking to sign them
[0:19:39] <ItzSwizzG> i enjoy fl0ms tedtalks
[0:19:39] <MinwFPS> @fl0m that was a big issue for TSM, i was told they tried getting into smaller tourneys when their problems started happening but were denied entry Sadge

[0:20:48] <STatisfacti0n> thanks man <3
[0:20:56] <weeeegy> nitr0 leaving the Val scene should be a huge alarm for Riot
[0:21:02] <Thatonekidmike> STatisfacti0n Isnt it kinda late to pull out of classes?
[0:21:10] <thehollowaytape> Similar to OW competitive
[0:21:15] <STatisfacti0n> @Thatonekidmike already pulled out of my classes earlier this semester
[0:21:16] <Chezpuf> sleeeeppyyyy getting paid for sitting on the couch 2 weeks ignoring eveyone? KEKW
[0:21:19] <grombs_> wait, this isnt pokemon lets go pikachu and eevee
[0:21:21] <ancalagon9608> like spunj mentioned on yesterday's podcast, the TO's want to embrace it but valve don't, which leads to two different efforts for the game's growth
[0:21:25] <Mazvydas> @fl0m do you think community ran Val servers would slingshot the game to ~CS level?
[0:21:28] <MinwFPS> @fl0m that was a big issue for TSM, i was told they tried getting into smaller tourneys when their problems started happening but were denied entry Sadge 󠀀
[0:21:31] <Mazvydas> *scene
[0:21:32] <TheAuditorTV> wait valorant has a tier 2 scene
[0:21:34] <STatisfacti0n> @Thatonekidmike have to pay off like 90% of my current balance to go back now
[0:21:38] <bobson300101> @fl0m their is two many teams in val especially when there is one fucking big tournament, who the fuck thought that would be the play id never know
[0:21:48] <Zommm_TTV> @davefmv I was honestly hoping it wasnt an NA writer because of the bias, but hey! Again, if you finish writing it, whisper me on Twitch!

[0:31:00] <flaffytoo> It’s interesting you say that there are too many teams in NA and not enough players.  Sounds like the players have the power, and could  take it upon themselves to stick with each other for more success in the long run.  Sort of like a union with 5 people in it.
