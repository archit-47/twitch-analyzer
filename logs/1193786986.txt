[0:32:35] <sh1f0> Hello this is Gabe from Valve, and I'm here to remind you of the importance of case opening. Every time you open a case the chance of opening a rare item gets higher, so even if you don't get someone else will, and that's what cs go is about, sharing happiness. Some people call it gambling, but you can take my word it's not. We exclusively use the money to develop every aspect in the game and for philanthropy. Valve stuff including management get paid minimum wage. spread the awareness

[1:45:00] <kenichidc> i feel like astralis and device are experiencing the same thing in terms of team cohesion and success

[1:45:18] <future_jason> If NIP win the Major, device will end up looking like Brady and people will be looking at the last couple years of device differently

[1:45:27] <Jay_rb> The system worked because of Device not the other way around
[1:45:33] <kenichidc> like they both device and astralis need each other to be the best

[2:24:12] <n0r13k> I think Grim is a great player, but he's in a bad role.
[2:24:14] <sealer9> replacing grim won't do shit for TL. they have different in game philosophies (stew/fallen)
[2:24:14] <WekePeke> zywoo???
[2:24:18] <Speedrulez> bolly doccy this is the cover https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lF2qEA2cw
[2:24:21] <Bolly> yeah I've listened to almost no Radiohead music
[2:24:24] <sle1pner> well he has a sort of gardennome look about him

[2:24:38] <Speedrulez> ratJAM
[2:24:38] <n0r13k> Nah, it is a role problem. He's playing RPK roles when he's an out and out fragger.
[2:24:43] <yaJgnizamA> sad to say but he clashes with fallen
[2:24:46] <so4pybox> I dont think grim is the problem its not really something you can pin on one player if its team cohesion

[5:50:02] <random_factz> Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, which happened to bring a laugh or a smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. yobtih  is probably a mod in here and he is the one that banned me.

Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree

[6:51:55] <sevengaming_tv> k1bsTV all my hopes ride on this next map Prayge
[6:51:56] <seamus_souleater> 2/5 isn't even half KEKW
[6:51:56] <spro_bro> yup OW did that
[6:51:59] <murlocnoies> @fl0m 3 NA players
[6:52:05] <cyanideaddict_> !1deag
[6:52:06] <tankwarhead> I have taken up gambling in fl0m’s chat but after the faze clan and VP match in the 2021 PGL major I have lost more than a man can ever dream of. I am in channel point debt and cant afford food anymore. I had to sell the kids and wife along with the house, yet I am still in debt…thanks faze clan
[6:52:07] <jaiden_42> Fl0m, take a shot everytime Jame saves😂
[6:52:08] <k1bsTV> WHY DIDNT I PICK EG 0-3
[6:52:08] <LowRatedHighlander> Hopium @sphhax
[6:52:09] <siiiif> World Champs in Football and Baseball KKona Clap
[6:52:10] <k1bsTV> WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME
[6:52:10] <D1srvpts> at least NA is better at nascar monkaSTEER smileW
[6:52:18] <djues333> k1bsTV you were on too much COPIUM
[6:52:20] <LowRatedHighlander> @k1bstv F
[6:52:22] <LowRatedHighlander> Sadge
[6:52:22] <Paroto7> nowadays , there is non NA players that count as NA players
[6:52:22] <sssaaarrrsss> Even the best american CS:GO players are asians and turks lol
[6:52:22] <k1bsTV> 100%
[6:52:23] <Raithorn> are we channel point betting?
[6:52:24] <STatisfacti0n> I really regret not picking EG for 0-3
[6:52:25] <bigbubbadave> they can only have 2 imports i believe
[6:52:25] <vontaro0> 2 imports but after 4 split u bexome resident Fl0m139
[6:52:25] <djues333> k1bsTV it's okay, it's gonna be fine Sadge
[6:52:27] <sphhax> At least NA is best at NASCAR KKona
[6:52:27] <murlocnoies> you cn have 2 imports @fl0m
[6:52:28] <Valentine_LoL> its 3. You can get NA recidency after 4 years though
[6:52:28] <Phoneutria> @jaiden_42 he'd be smashed by round 10
[6:52:28] <Yourknightmares> 3 NA, but players playing in LCS for like 4 years are considered NA players
[6:52:30] <CortanaLXIX> since the imports can get residency there already is team with one "true" NA player
[6:52:32] <1shoxiefan> predictions
[6:52:33] <Dynamo_Dave> its probably easier to direct money in eu countries since the geographical size is smaller. NA players could be spread over a lot of space which makes it a lot harder for growth

[7:14:36] <sle1pner> Players win = more exposure, more exposure = bigger sponsors, that is what pays for this stuff, not prize money

[9:25:40] <siiiif> BSODslayer: @fl0m Two data points for the Danish TV viewership, even though they're slightly old: The 2019 Katowice Major had an average of 95.000 viewers, peaking at 389.000 across the TV channel and their streaming service, beating their previous record of 73.000 avg./216.000 peak during the 2018 Blast Pro Lissabon...

[10:11:42] <DavieWhy> win = good, die = bad
[10:11:42] <dankiyy> all they gotta do is get more rounds than the opponent
[10:11:43] <Mercz94> it says a lot that instead of adjusting and putting rez on 2nd or 3rd in they keep trying to force the entry, red flag
[10:11:44] <agarlicbear> if you win a round you're one round closer to winning
