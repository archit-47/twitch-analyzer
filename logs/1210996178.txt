[5:04:31] <LucidR9> stat lets hoe something you do
[5:04:36] <zuzu47777> @LucidR9 i would argue that the symmetry of the balls is relevant to the shape, so the existance of square balls would fulfill the symetry, but not the natural roundness of balls
[5:04:42] <tzinga7> the HUD in that event streams. vertical HP etc
[5:04:45] <sleeeeppyyyy> hey LucidR9 Kappa

[7:29:31] <kenaiii> @ADEastwood ur cpu probably limiting ur performance,
[7:29:38] <amirrrz> stats show that people with avg sized cocks typically have higher fps than those with smaller or larger
[7:29:40] <vis9ns> 3080 and i9-10900k is 600+ fps NODDERS
