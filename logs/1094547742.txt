[0:25:43] <LowRatedHighlander> But a flat 100k like bruh
[0:25:48] <LowRatedHighlander> That’s a decent amount of money
[0:25:49] <zephyfrags> damn i got to get 2 pc's to stream cs KEKW
[0:25:53] <c0rkmcnortis> i guess it kinda depends on how much the %? of the keys was

[0:26:31] <apodis10> isn't ~ 100k more than the skin creators got under the old system?
[0:26:33] <dweevers> sleeeeppyyyy meh you get credit for it on your home countries taxes
[0:26:52] <c0rkmcnortis> Justhoohaa yeah it seems like people are getting angry without knowing what the alternative really is
[0:26:59] <SepiDrunk> POGGIES 3klik
[0:27:22] <m0FFFFF> how much are they gna make off art that isnt their own tho
[0:27:24] <FiberZ_> @ghostfacesahil do you need a team for that?
[0:27:30] <ghostfacesahil> @FiberZ_ nope, just join.
[0:27:33] <m0FFFFF> ofc theyre throwing a 100 thou at em
[0:27:36] <abhi007bond> @fl0m you ok buddy ?
[0:27:38] <VohanAMV> 100k is still 100k, CSGO could also make it a Competition with only 1000€ price money. It’s up to everyone himself whether he wants to participate or not.
[0:27:38] <TheSkidds> @c0rkmcnortis I mean, It seems like people get angry/upset about everything now haha
[0:27:40] <ghostfacesahil> @FiberZ_ you get added to a team lacking members :)
[0:27:42] <vinciCS> lmao, how are people mad at this. This isn't valve taking money from skin creators, its a participate at your own will competition. If your primary source of income is dependant on future valve weapon skin royalties, that is your own fault
[0:27:47] <m0FFFFF> easy cut off for basically free amount of work

[0:27:49] <kitocantaim> apcHype
[0:27:49] <FiberZ_> ty
[0:27:49] <ImNathanT> in 2016? Hasnt the player base and spend increase since then?
[0:27:52] <LowRatedHighlander> All the people that are angry are the same people that take the 100 dollars a month instead of the million dollar 1 time payment
[0:27:55] <ghostfacesahil> @FiberZ_ happy hunting!
[0:27:57] <yourducky> of course the neck beards of reddit get mad when people make more money than they do in 10 years KEKW
[0:27:58] <shots67> maybe in yt history?
[0:28:05] <VohanAMV> True @vincics
[0:28:17] <colewitha1> this system is also probably just way easier and more convenient for valve
[0:28:20] <zellers4> Getting 100k is pretty nuts up front
[0:28:28] <zellers4> even after taxes
[0:28:29] <ImNathanT> money in your hand does beat moeny down the line, reinvesting etc...
[0:28:42] <c0rkmcnortis> @vinciCS it's not about being reliant on it, it's getting potentially getting more money for your work. Not really something to get mad about though because 100k up front is a lot for a single work of art
[0:29:16] <BizarreMark> SHRUGGERS

[0:29:31] <squaremason1> rust might
[0:29:36] <JustVinny_> Barely any other games have that level of community content
[0:29:41] <DavieWhy> !su ducky
[0:29:44] <colewitha1> nobody does it to this level
[0:29:45] <m0FFFFF> split up? or individually each 100k

[0:29:56] <apodis10> i don't understand how anyone can be upset about getting about 2 years of average salary for a single skin
[0:29:57] <Justhoohaa> @m0fffff it's a full case of skins. so 100k per skin picked is how I read it
[0:29:58] <sleeeeppyyyy> m0FFFFF each winner gets 100k. total of 1mil
[0:29:58] <landowner101> Probably but not through a public workshop. I mean companies hire artists
[0:30:00] <DavieWhy> meh
[0:30:03] <nanerpus_> Most companies will specifically not allow submission of community created content because if they use something even somewhat close to it, even if they alredy had it in the work, they could be liable
[0:30:06] <LowRatedHighlander> fuckin phone big angy
[0:30:10] <m0FFFFF> no other game makes billions overall overtime off art that they didnt create LUL
[0:30:12] <yourducky> its reddit if they arent making money then they hate everything else KEKW
[0:30:13] <ImNathanT> Do we think this is going to increase the quality of the skins going forward?

[0:30:16] <bolottekid> MLADY chat and papa fl0m
[0:30:20] <VohanAMV> As I said, CSGO is not required to give out any money at all. This is a competition that you can enter off your own free will. If you ain’t willing to sell your art for 100k flat, don’t participate. Easy as that.

[0:33:36] <LowRatedHighlander> I get the discussion, but at the end of the discussion it should be realized that 100k is way more than any company would give and is a pretty good payout
[0:33:38] <mmmsaj> There’s a section on their faq that says you get paid 100k and that’s it
[0:33:38] <vinciCS> my problem with it is, apparently the whole globaloffensive reddit is now all skin artists that are directly impacted by these changes. Reddit is mostly people whining on behalf of other people

[0:36:19] <atypicalquil> unholy things
[0:36:20] <TRADEBANNED> EZ win
[0:36:22] <apodis10> the possibility that artists are even in a position to make money of skins is entirely dependent on valve creating and maintaining the infrastructure, the intellectual properties, the servers, markering, the entire steam ecosystem and workshop; but yeah it's valve screwing over the artists Kapp
[0:36:23] <c0rkmcnortis> i mean what it comes down to is how long is that case gonna be opened for?
[0:36:27] <gosubloody> @m0FFFFF +1
[0:36:28] <bluehipp0> @m0FFFFF send me a list...
[0:36:30] <hongkongphoo3y> of course everyone prefers annuities
[0:36:32] <vinciCS> its not fucking people over if the terms are made clear beforehand, how can people not compute this. If valve made this decision after a royalty agreement was made, sure they are fucking people over. This is not the case
[0:36:35] <nanerpus_> I can tell you that if they stopped taking community supported skins and went the route of hiring contract artists to make skins, they are going to be paying alot less than 100k a skin
[0:36:37] <m0FFFFF> DONT ASK

[2:03:45] <Lawsn_> ture
[2:03:45] <atypicalquil> ive experienced issues with that on mm servers
[2:03:48] <Lawsn_> true
[2:03:56] <dotalegendery2> Trueee
[2:03:59] <stormshitman> people still only que dust 2 so its aids
[2:04:01] <JohnnyBG> give premier 128 tick severs Prayge
[2:04:09] <StochasticDiscount> How can it be the best if people can't pay to play one map over and over? monkaHmm
[2:04:11] <Lawsn_> you can avoid that by not selecting mirage because it fucking sucks dick as a map anyway though
[2:04:24] <evil_m0rti> good guy valve supporting other businesses
[2:04:25] <gautam28> I think it's one of the reason valve is not adding 128 tick
[2:04:29] <apodis10> i think the improvements to mm were a not-so-subtle hint to the third party services
[2:04:34] <gonzocc> obese CEO and his dota bias WeirdEyes
[2:04:42] <sgtflintstone98> @fl0m those some reasons that valve hasnt made MM 128 tick and everything else? some behind closed doors agreements with these comapanies

[2:04:59] <Lawsn_> 128 tick would dead ass make the cheater problem worse in MM because the closets would hit more shots
[2:05:00] <Justhoohaa> it blows my mind how good valve servers are compared to esea and Faceit. I never get the ping spikes and just in general shitty servers

[4:59:01] <Puddin_Wing> donnie darko is dog trash. I didn't care for his performance or the overall awful movie @apodis10
[4:59:23] <Justhoohaa> Donnie Darko gets way too much praise
[4:59:24] <lordthehagfish> Feeny, nor the fan base. ew
[4:59:24] <LowRatedHighlander> I honestly haven’t seen Donnie darko
[4:59:27] <WookiePotamus> im tryna come up with an idea to make a skin for the dream nightmare thing its so hard KEKW
[4:59:29] <gangstergoose47> That moment when you have to implement more ads to stream until it just becomes a stream for ads #ads

[5:00:40] <Justhoohaa> I haven't seen an ad in forever. ez nitro
[5:00:41] <LowRatedHighlander> All I do is play ads and fuck dads EZ
[5:00:42] <Puddin_Wing> nice moves @lordthehagfish
[5:00:45] <Aero_1> fucking 30 second ads back to back
[5:00:45] <weneg13> weneg13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[5:00:45] <Techno> - weneg13 just re-subscribed for 28 months! fl0mPog
[5:00:48] <sylveonkid1> well i can skip adds on youtube after 5 seconds i cant on fl0ms stream
[5:00:48] <Luigistarx> buy turbo ez fix
[5:00:49] <TheAverageGoob> The ads ARE bad because they interrupt content unlike TV where they pause the content, then play..or a video....ads don't make sense on live content.
[5:00:49] <lordthehagfish> fl0mCult
[5:00:52] <F1nite> not even getting ads KevinTurtle
[5:00:54] <KKona_from_Oklahoma> if you have 6 ads just watch one and refresh and it skips the other 5
[5:00:58] <Archit47> fl0mH fl0mH
[5:00:59] <macbookfps> @WookiePotamus what if you did one inspired by a horror movie, e.g. freddie kreuger
[5:00:59] <MAGIERR> just get turbo 😎
[5:01:04] <lordthehagfish> ty ty fl0mCult
[5:01:06] <plainsofcelestis> the thing with other platforms is they dont try block adblock like twitch does
[5:01:10] <macbookfps> @WookiePotamus he was a character that killed people in their dreams
[5:01:15] <kevo702> how much is turbo?
[5:01:16] <Voidism_> wow that's quite a blue gem
[5:01:16] <TheAverageGoob> They should be doing sponsored banner ads for live - no need to replace the content
[5:01:19] <jbirdblue> THe thing with twitch ads is the streams witching and also when they are random and it is disruptive to the content. Sports for example have scheduled tv timeouts and so do traditional tv shows. harder to control that with twitch
[5:01:20] <WookiePotamus> @macbookfps cant hes licensed
[5:01:23] <LowRatedHighlander> Only time I get irritated with ads is poorly timed ones like during the last round of cologne
[5:01:29] <Nightbot> Latest video: Spectating CS:GO Silver Games turned into a Drinking Game! w/ JERICHO - https://youtu.be/_FFx5XvoG8Y
[5:01:30] <gangstergoose47> @lordthehagfish Breh....Thanks for the gift sub! daveyYOU
[5:01:37] <StormbornVal> Shroud mid rolled ad on final round on map 3 of Cologne
[5:01:39] <andrewmedaTV> I don't ever get ads without adblock and no turbo either. I can't remember the last ad i saw on twitch
[5:01:41] <TheAverageGoob> I get that subbing gets rid of ads, but the whole idea of how they have it setup just seems crazy unthought out
[5:01:43] <BizarreMark> OOOO
[5:01:49] <lordthehagfish> @gangstergoose47 Welcome back fl0mCult
[5:01:56] <Archit47> shroud did mid roll ads during cologne streams
[5:01:57] <Mountie888> a global twitch sub would be cool, where you just get guaranteed no adds for X amount of time regardless of the channel or switching, and higher tiers gives longer gaps between
[5:02:07] <Pegrum> Sub to everyone you watch then you'll get no ads. 200iq
[5:02:13] <StormbornVal> @Archit47 on the last round no less
[5:02:22] <ScholarSignus> or if the video player glitches, that can cause false pre-rolls sometiems
[5:02:23] <TheAverageGoob> Right, I know the streamer has control over that - but I am saying that it shouldn't be on content creators to manage ads; but then again streamers get paid for ads. So a little work to make a good stream
[5:02:23] <Puddin_Wing> i mean in fairness shroud needs the ad money it's not like he's fuckin loaded @StormbornVal
[5:02:25] <Archit47> @Archit47 on multiple rounds
[5:02:25] <Puddin_Wing> OpieOP
[5:02:26] <Not_Flag> i have unfollowed many streams due to that fact
[5:02:40] <jbirdblue> I didnt know thats how those ads worked
[5:02:42] <dweevers> Mountie888 what you're describing is Turbo
[5:03:00] <StormbornVal> @Puddin_Wing Yeah but u also could delay it by 15 fkin seconds so 30k of ur viewers can see the winning round
[5:03:14] <Mountie888> @dweevers so youre saying i should just work for twitch? i gots big brain ideas
[5:03:14] <KillerBossYT_> open a case after this round LUL
[5:03:14] <TheAverageGoob> No, no, I am saying the full takeover on the stream is crazy to do on a live content platform.
[5:03:26] <dweevers> Mountie888 I mean they already used your idea so maybe?
[5:03:26] <LowRatedHighlander> That or it’s Tyler1 and he’s playing an ad to punish his plebs KEKW
[5:03:27] <Puddin_Wing> I was kidding, shroud's paid as fuck, he doesn't need the ad revenue @StormbornVal
[5:03:36] <LegolasZidane> yeah true
[5:03:49] <iVex> hello
[5:03:51] <iVex> Peeposit
[5:03:52] <Puddin_Wing> I know, I was just making a joke @fl0m
[5:03:53] <gangstergoose47> Yeah. I've honestly got nothing against it. It does suck when the ads pop up mid stream after switching around a lot. I'd be down to have a button to pre roll myself honestly
[5:03:54] <Not_Flag> shroud has to run ads due to contract
[5:03:54] <Archit47> @StormbornVal he always has a bot running that does the midroll ads
[5:03:55] <lordthehagfish> Dont worry feeny, I caught your sarcasm

[5:06:12] <Mountie888> all this ad talk just sounds like zoomers not used to watching TV pre-PVR days
[5:06:12] <ottomaanikko> But it's the same with other channels too, for some reason in EU you don't see as many ads ever if the streamer rolls it

[5:22:04] <evilvillain> silver gameplay is wild though. Never know what you get.
[5:22:12] <WookiePotamus> it truly depends on me and how the other team is playing
[5:22:12] <LowRatedHighlander> Wait this is gonna be kinda like sub wars except it’s just silver and it’s against Jericho’s silvers
[5:22:19] <macbookfps> @WookiePotamus i think it'll depend on how tucker's 5 stack of silvers play, if they lurk and ratJAM then obv we have to sweat

[6:19:01] <thej6s> @theHovnival thanks. I just looked it up. Apparently there are 2 different places that are commonly called kitchen. One of them being market, the other being back appartments (where an actual kitchen is)
[6:19:02] <praeter15> Booooooolin more like
[6:19:06] <fastcars888> magisk+
[6:19:08] <999conry> RUSH to mythic PauseChamp @fl0m

[6:19:18] <fastcars888> magisk

[6:19:20] <BoomingBusiness> @priiide_ rumours were they were looking at Astralis players I believe
[6:19:20] <c0rkmcnortis> was it xyp?
[6:19:21] <nmars_> kenny
[6:19:21] <sjoerdtheman> it was magisk
[6:19:21] <SlickZkilleR> xyp

[6:19:42] <sjoerdtheman> xyp to faze YEP
[6:19:42] <999conry> maybe they move k0nfig to main entry
[6:19:43] <sealer9> xyp was to faze
[6:19:43] <MrFortyOz> I love RUSH but he has bad stats because he holds the worst sites and entry baits
[6:19:45] <BoomingBusiness> Praeter FeelsOkayMan
[6:19:46] <LowRatedHighlander> magisk I think
[6:19:47] <theHovnival> @thej6s hence, my original message
[6:19:51] <WookiePotamus> @Chezpuf im assuming this weekend but not confirmed atm
[6:19:54] <priiide_> who are the danes going to bait now
[6:19:55] <Quick_Lets_Run> KennyS?
[6:19:57] <apodis10> faze xyp9s is some real alternate dimension stuff
[6:19:59] <999conry> so couldn't they put k0nfig first guy in and magisk 2nd? @fl0m
[6:20:00] <Plaay4Fun> what is the whole Astralis team leaving?
[6:20:01] <apodis10> it seems so unreal
[6:20:01] <Chezpuf> I cna do weekends NODDERS

[6:20:24] <thej6s> @theHovnival That's probably where the misunderstandment is coming from. In EU it's more common to call 'market' 'kitchen' - all in all, it's just a bad callout I guess

[6:22:35] <theHovnival> @yobtih probably right, but doing it once as a 10 man of silvers may be solid
[6:22:36] <mern_eh> @Quick_Lets_Run they built a team and then disbanded
[6:22:36] <thej6s> Could the difference be that in NA you play during the day while in EU you play during the evening (EU evening that is)
