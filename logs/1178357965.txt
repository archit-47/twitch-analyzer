[0:19:27] <ttakenn> @MaxofMine you could hear when something touched the water anywhere on the map
[0:19:57] <tac0tek> or inferno fountain
[0:20:02] <Uwotm08> The walking-through-water sound would be emanated from dead teammates' bodies lying around the map if an alive teammate walked through water.

[0:20:20] <hobrev> valve explained it really complicatedly in the update
[0:20:20] <Alireza_GM> @drivel___ an employee at valve asked about what causes it on reddit 2 days ago i think
[0:20:23] <Cake315> mythic secret tactic to win matches is gone now the water bug
[0:20:23] <Uwotm08> This would allow a CT to know about rotations through T spawn if they were nearby a killed enemy.
[0:20:24] <ttakenn> I have the water bug but with vents on mirage, like i can be in T spawn and will hear the vent being broken as if i was next to it

[1:39:17] <cardboardtoast> good morning @fl0m !!
[1:39:27] <D1srvpts> Chat there’s this cool thing called mythic league where you always get teammates who talk MmmHmm
[1:39:27] <co1t25> @fl0m do you think the economy is not good for short matches?
[1:39:33] <Deagent9> all short matches need is the economy adjusted. you lose pistol and half the half is gone
[1:39:36] <dimesntreys> tbf the econ kinda sucks for ct
[1:39:37] <whitechocolate64> %? OT
[1:39:37] <Nightbot> Joris says 53%
[1:39:38] <jockst3r> faceit short matches were also unranked sooo that might also be why no one played it
[1:39:40] <alexb789> I'm EU and I tried to play it but only 35 people were in queue
[1:39:41] <jockst3r> @fl0m
[1:39:45] <Cacemen> fl0m mythic content cup with short matches when? PauseFish
[1:39:57] <4d_printr> @Deagent9 absolutely true, saving is almost not an option for short matches
[1:39:58] <errorCS_BM> ye
[1:40:01] <co1t25> It feels like eco for the entire game
[1:40:07] <therealhype1> is short matches mr 12? i actually havent played yet
[1:40:08] <MigBryan> What maps are bad for short matches
[1:40:08] <huntad> Yeah, that's true
[1:40:12] <ringo0> how do we feel about the OT deciders for the RMR event?
[1:40:17] <hobrev> mr8
[1:40:22] <k1p_csgo> u know valve is gonna take their time right :D
[1:40:23] <theofu42> Winning pistol way to important in short matches tho rn imo
[1:40:25] <djfatguy> what would you think about short match majors
[1:40:27] <Deagent9> they could just try wingman rules. just raise them minimum lose bonus keep everything else the same
[1:40:28] <theofu42> too*
[1:40:30] <gmor_> adjust my dials fl0mGasm
[1:40:33] <dimesntreys> its also csgo so who knows how hard it would be to adjust the economy just for short matches
[1:40:50] <co1t25> @fl0m what do you think of max cash short matches like ot?
[1:41:01] <Deagent9> @4d_printr yea but once you start youll never be able to get a full buy unless you force buy win
[1:41:02] <Random_user_1> I hate short matches, no benefit except for adhs people who can't sit down for 40 mins
[1:41:06] <BizarreMark> peepoW please font

[2:48:46] <Justhoohaa> i dont see how they are able to bench him

[2:49:00] <debux> pretty sure its bubski who's behind the reddit account "nikolai_nyholms_gimp"
[2:49:03] <Aqueilas_tv> They should bench xyp instead
[2:49:06] <Madfish2021> the deduction of points for the major discourages 6 man rosters

[2:49:24] <abhi007bond> KEKWait benched, this talk just makes me peepoAngy against ASTRALIS
[2:49:25] <ItsAho> I mean does bub even get played after xyp leaves because of the konfig deal
[2:49:26] <kooshyy> @fl0m but they wouldnt bench lucky when they just bought him would they?
[2:49:28] <Morde24> no they lost 20% points they just had enough
[2:49:30] <Raithorn> 1 alt player and 1 coach. You lose 20% points for player sub beyond that
[2:49:32] <AFugy> %? I'm not crazy
[2:49:32] <Nightbot> Joris says 23%
[2:49:37] <AFugy> Crungo
[2:49:38] <Dynamo_Dave> they should have a 10 man roster to help with players whom are burnt out

[2:50:42] <JakestersLab> Fl0m do you think teams not having coaches available in game at the major might shake some things up? NaVi seem to depend a lot on blade
[2:50:54] <Mussejusse> could have gone to literally any danish or international team bar faze probably
[2:50:55] <LowRatedHighlander> wAllCS man i love getting paid to not play in the major
[2:50:55] <MaxofMine> I feel as though Valve wants to make CS and game to pick up with your friends and qualify for the major maybe

[2:51:27] <k3ny0nn> they're not nifty
[2:51:28] <Aqueilas_tv> Man hes been playing well for Astralis imo, and hes been playing against T1 teams instead of T2 teams
[2:51:36] <LowRatedHighlander> its better than not getting paid but its still shitty

[2:51:57] <r_udra> @LowRatedHighlander WeirdEyes players like to play its not about the money

[3:00:59] <octoshark191> @tr1L_cs There are pros and cons to it; the issue is that problems that this model is associated with aren't really associated with other models -- even if other models have problems that this one doesn't. I know what you mean, though.
[3:01:02] <f0bbi> csgo has had more players than dota for over a year now
[3:01:05] <im_always_infamous> take time off Kappa
[3:01:05] <Artsywyo> G2 is a roster that needs a roster change but you cant change the roster without a brand new 5
[3:01:07] <sealer9> another day another no charge on double meat at chjipotle. that means liquid is winning.

[3:01:10] <vinciCS> four man roster, and let niko pick up the bot when he dies 5Head
[3:01:10] <aki_kleist> Was NiKo really worth, is the question, but then again G2 was held hostage
[3:01:14] <boomitsbj> doesn't dota make more money off their battlepass than CS, maybe CS has more skin sales
[3:01:15] <jockst3r> what change would they make? and who could possibly replace them atm
[3:01:23] <dotalegendery2> cs makes alot more money imo since it was a paid game for a long time
[3:01:23] <need_a_name__> hampus also said in an interview that amanek is the most important player in g2
[3:01:24] <umaroreis> dota 2 is more profitable only for the t1 teams
[3:01:25] <jockst3r> idk I dont see it
[3:01:28] <rwreyford> with the scale of the international I think there is more money centralized in dota. CS probably has a higher cap but seems more de-centralized
[3:01:31] <beranabus__> if only they had a star awper... wait
[3:01:35] <vexnstylezz> i feel like g2 rely on amanek to much sometimes or like hes put in bad situations but i also might just be dumb
[3:01:47] <sealer9> similar to liquid after nitr0 left
[3:01:47] <Madfish2021> basically simple and electronic star rifler and star awper
[3:01:52] <Raithorn> @fl0m do you think G2 went after smooya at all?
[3:02:01] <IraklisMann> @beranabus__let him go. he is long gone
[3:02:05] <Justhoohaa> i just think -hunter +kennys frees up Niko and brings in an actual
[3:02:10] <Justhoohaa> awp
[3:02:14] <apoodle10> not only that, but also currently a bigger player base and, from what i can tell, a more active and also more expensive skins market dotalegendery2

[3:02:46] <whatisspectralsamurai> Sadge Nitro
[3:02:49] <marathon_fish> @fl0m do think nexa could pick up a more supportive role and bring in a stronger awper?

[3:02:55] <f0bbi> nexa got fucked
[3:02:56] <ElaD_O> I think the only way you remove amanek or jackz is you remove them both and bring two completely different pieces. but I don't know if that's an improvement
[3:02:58] <boomitsbj> G2 made a final a couple months ago so this iteration can be a top team

[3:24:31] <sealer9> last time we watched g2 liquid liquid wrapped arch to b into a stack on 14-13 to basically lose

[6:49:48] <LucidR9> yeah especially when you finish the coke and eat the bottle - the cane sugar really adds something to the glass taste
[6:49:48] <boxxythegoat> it brings out a different taste
[6:49:48] <freeziezgtm> no high fructose corn syrup Pog
[6:49:50] <Scornfulboot_eu> UK pop is dog shit since we got the sugar tax

[6:50:08] <bighosslife> you still tryin to far cry with gtr?
[6:50:15] <caffeinetx> the carbonation is different in glass vs plastic vs can fl0m. they actually use high fructose corn syrup in mexican coke now. they make a different cane sugar one just for the US market KEKW

[7:08:58] <td_gg> confidence plays a ginormous role
[7:09:00] <dograt19> @fl0m i know you opinions on valorant but guild just eliminated g2 from lcq 2-0. i know i'll be flamed in chat for saying this, but it's huge for guild.
[7:09:01] <dealjw> Do you think it has to do with all the back and forth from Europe? @fl0m I mean of course it helps having the better opponents but on the mental it must be tough
[7:09:02] <DoXiccles> RIP Grim

[7:09:10] <d0ughtyy> I can see how mentally frustrating it can be

[7:09:16] <geeko101> but mental IS the skill 5Head
[7:09:24] <PappySanta> i think the reason why astralis became so great was how well they conquered the mental shit and how long they did it was impressive

[7:17:24] <fireblazz_phoenix> Why the hell can't liquid ever take convincing lead? I would say that 1 or 2 extra force buys are responsible for this.
[7:17:26] <abhi007bond> @eclipse42 Kissahomie
[7:17:35] <MaxofMine> I think the only match I liked was when they played Astralis last year when they just added Yekindar.
[7:17:41] <Inversion101> I feel like VP playstyle is just so bad, teams who get used to playing vs them always start to dominate them every tier 2/3 teams. They only win against teams who infrequently play against them.

[7:27:33] <orphansquirel> maybe they watched the demos and found that theres something choreographed whenever liquid does a b hit they seemed confident for some reason

[7:29:09] <fireblazz_phoenix> @Spudack I actually think that perhaps over confidence is the problem. You don't continuosly force buy if you don't have high confidence. Unfortunatley that same thing would be liquid's demise.

[7:32:44] <fireblazz_phoenix> @Spudack I think when you are up 8-1, you can accept a defeat in 1 round and get a full buy. Your only losing opportunity to get the enemy team back is exactly with losing continuous force-buys.
[7:32:49] <td_gg> @speciality_ Bruh, it was reduced a while back but it just got buffed meaning its the go to CT rifle meaning they can buy cheaper

[7:34:32] <Spudack> @fireblazz_phoenix yeah i agree. i think at some point it was that they were confident to be able to win those force buys with worse guns but then it kinda became them just kinda trying to get those lost rounds back and it becoming more of a desperation buy
