[0:32:42] <LucidR9> or you could use scroll wheel like my man fallen
[0:32:53] <therealpurriku> thats all by design tho
[0:32:55] <hobrev> do you have dedicated utility binds?
[0:32:57] <AMutantCookie> I dont get that, same with KJ mollies
[0:33:07] <Tettrum> like reyna flash you have a pulling out animation, a casting animation, airtime, and an activation animation
[0:33:11] <SoporificPanda> valorant slow game play for slow brain players

[0:34:06] <Tettrum> wait you dont
[0:34:07] <JalapenoJeppe> i cycle 4 all the time even after binding them i cant get away from muscle memory
[0:34:07] <SoporificPanda> 🚴 any cyclers? 🚴
[0:34:08] <SupraUK_> he's not senile and hitting the wrong bind, he's senile and doesn't have the bind at all
[0:34:08] <Tettrum> HOW
[0:34:09] <k1bsTV> @fl0m Even though you don't use it, I would still recommend people do it if they have spare keys
[0:34:09] <garrygobulcoque> That sounds like an oddly specific thing. Does nori own an alligator Chanel XD
