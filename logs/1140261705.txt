[4:52:44] <Doccy> then we should have an open slot
[4:52:46] <Doccy> so
[4:52:52] <Bob0_s> PEEPEE
[4:52:58] <Doccy> as we don't i assume someone replaced it
[4:53:09] <dweevers> Doccy if the version we have was deleted it will still take up an emote slot for fl0m I believe
[4:53:11] <Doccy> and that would have to be someone with permissions to do so
[4:53:12] <Semiproshark7> um so y does the gamba make no sense lol
[4:53:20] <Doccy> meaning fl0m or hitboy or me
[4:53:30] <Dynamo_Dave> it's 5:45 and I have to get some sleep sadge
[4:53:32] <Schwindy> all in on Mythic Pog
[4:53:37] <macbookfps> You’re picking the team that loses @semiproshark7

[4:54:00] <PartTimeMage> ResidentSleeper
[4:54:02] <dweevers> Sadge
[4:54:02] <Archit47> Schwindy did u read it tho
[4:54:06] <dweevers> can we blame hitboy?

[4:54:23] <Schwindy> I can't read bro
[4:54:24] <dweevers> I wonder if it got removed for the silver cast emotes
[4:54:32] <Doccy> or reported i assume
