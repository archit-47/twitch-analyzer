[0:58:46] <EoinMon> hi chat
[0:59:06] <Mazvydas> fl0mHi
[0:59:13] <adiaphoros> you just never have to reload and when you're combining elementals you can just constantly trigger fusions. there's also scrolls/inscriptions that allow you to deal more damage with less bullets in your mag so you can just fire everything except 1 bullet, then pick up that scroll.

[0:59:14] <Nightbot> MLADY
[1:00:06] <Nightbot> MERCH DROP IS LIVE fl0mstore.com
[1:00:20] <adiaphoros> there's also other inscriptions where the more bullets you fire, the higher your damage which gets reset on reload i think? i'm good man, i had a lot of fun with this game for a while.
[1:00:55] <pigawn> theres no hard cap but it depends on the amount of upgrade npcs you get in a run. and gold ofc
[1:01:04] <Nightbot> Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
[1:01:18] <hattiwatti_> yeah there are different kind of sick combinations and guns that work well with advanced depot, but even if u dont have anything special with it, it is just really chill to play when u can just blast away and never worry about reloading :p
[1:01:19] <adiaphoros> your dude you're playing right now has an ascension where it stacks your damage on your cleave every last hit you get with it so you can have some STOOPID damage toward end game if you get it early enough lol.

[1:03:40] <adiaphoros> hahaha true. it's real nice if you gets any of the gloves.
[1:03:46] <Mazvydas> is there a way to get "perma" scrollis in this game? i.e. pick scrolls you start with or no?
[1:03:56] <hattiwatti_> yeah its like -15% dps first thought ofc :D
[1:04:55] <adiaphoros> flom makin me wanna play this game again lol.
