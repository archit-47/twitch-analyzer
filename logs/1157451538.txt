[2:48:45] <datkidaa> Agreed
[2:48:47] <LuckyGun> @ReV_Ant yeah parts like this are what defines a competitive team imo
[2:49:03] <Koalanoob> they just read well and it makes it harder for the team and they just adapted a lot quicker

[2:49:21] <ImTarco> @ReV_Ant Exactly. Some of the best teams in the world, they have a great igl, sure, but the game changer is how the squad works together. Mythic right now is a lot of bumping heads mid-round.
[2:49:40] <Koalanoob> if you guys are losing control that fast and they have all that info you guys just need to react so much faster
[2:49:53] <Archit47> Sadge loss
[2:49:58] <Koalanoob> thats what they need to learn i truly dont think its them "focusing" on stats completely
[2:50:02] <offwhite> @ImTarco yeah its night and day if you watch how, for example, heroic play together, then you watch g2 lol
[2:50:03] <bpd173> is match over?

[2:50:14] <el_chapo_jr13> hi @chrizlazer

[2:50:18] <LuckyGun> @ImTarco green players issue maybe?
[2:50:19] <Doccy> yes @bpd173
[2:50:23] <LuckyGun> @chrizlazer MLADY
