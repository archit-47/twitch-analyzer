[0:50:27] <frogoree> priiide_ yeah you dont stand a chance vs a controller in a close range duel
[0:50:27] <Xouske> give xbox a mouse and keyboard peripheral KEKW
[0:50:27] <420Enigma> Wassup fl0m wassup chat, happy Saturday!
[0:50:44] <wafers19> !5th
[0:50:44] <Nightbot> We're doing the tryouts still. Don't ask if you can tryout. These aren't open tryouts. -. -
[0:50:50] <j_a_r_l> or you eliminate aim assist and throw those console plebs to the wolves..
[0:51:12] <charliefirth22> where is kenny
[0:51:12] <MagicMarker1> Aim assist should not be in any eSport tourney thats just facts
[0:51:21] <Uwotm08> Agreed.
[0:51:30] <Shy_tx> Yes
[0:51:32] <gilbilly_> Aim assist should just not be a thing. Get gud
[0:51:42] <exhila> aim assist is fine if its against other console players
[0:51:43] <abdulfps1> can you suggest me best crosshair on native resolution
[0:51:46] <frogoree> i feel like aim assist is way stronger than it was even in the halo 3 days.
[0:51:46] <Shy_tx> At least not in multiplayer
[0:51:49] <Wellz> i didnt need it in Halo 3
[0:52:10] <Uwotm08> It wasn't even unfair since I'm sure fl0m has a console controller in his household that he could've paired with the PC, but it was silly to watch.
[0:52:24] <AFugy> peepoIQ PEEPEES
[0:52:26] <frogoree> yeah everyone was terrible back then KEKW before everyone wanted to be a streamer or something
[0:52:27] <gilbilly_> Aim assist I basically cheating

[0:52:32] <abdulfps1> im mostly confused in choosing my crosshair
[0:52:46] <Uwotm08> Totally understood.
[0:52:47] <BooomerNinja> I remember when HooHaa was just a queue sniping rat, he's actually a pretty good player now
[0:52:47] <mern_eh> I assume the new 5th will be revealed closer to the cup start
[0:52:48] <Shy_tx> Same
[0:53:04] <abdulfps1> :o

[0:53:48] <hokieboy01> FeelsOkayMan
[0:53:56] <frogoree> all i know is it feels terrible to get lasered by a controller when i know that would never happen on mkb
[0:54:06] <BooomerNinja> @priiide_ He queues with fl0m now, so i guess it worked LUL
