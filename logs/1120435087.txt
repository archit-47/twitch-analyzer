[0:55:43] <LowRatedHighlander> honestly same
[0:55:52] <LucidR9> that's literally what he does, all the people who give him large amounts of money he makes mod so he doesnt have to keep thanking them because they are indebted to him for becoming mod
[0:56:05] <STatisfacti0n> indebted? shit bro this is my curse
[0:56:10] <STatisfacti0n> and I'm too much of a pussy to remove it
[0:56:13] <Puddin_Wing> What if I told you guys it's less because you're mods and more because you've got the combined social aptitude of a broken pencil sharpener @STatisfacti0n @LowRatedHighlander
[0:56:23] <Puddin_Wing> I mean
[0:56:25] <LowRatedHighlander> i mean
[0:56:28] <LowRatedHighlander> true feeny
[0:56:28] <Puddin_Wing> uhhhhhh
[0:56:29] <Fl0msS0n> Oh shit come at em
[0:56:38] <STatisfacti0n> broken pencil sharpener? bro that's given me way too much credit
[0:56:42] <LucidR9> does a working pencil sharpener have more social aptitude than a broken one?
[0:56:45] <LowRatedHighlander> but still!
[0:56:53] <FiberZ_> heaven smoke KEKW
[0:56:56] <STatisfacti0n> I'm like as sharp in social situations as a memory foam pillow

[0:57:52] <LowRatedHighlander> mine weighs like 15 pounds i could break a neck in a pillow fight
[0:57:59] <Fl0msS0n> Are they good for your neck?
[0:58:09] <LucidR9> LowRatedHighlander I put my arm under my pillow so that's probably not a good thing
