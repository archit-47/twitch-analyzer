[0:32:15] <AssistMaster98n4> Giant Eagles will literally throw goats off cliffs to kill them.
[0:32:17] <SuperTuscan888> lunceja06 dude? paapoWeird
[0:32:17] <BizarreMark> paapoWeird
[0:32:20] <yourducky> lunceja06 kinda weak spam
[0:32:21] <sjoerdtheman> feeny cs is 21 years old and csgo is 9 years old so he just took the average of the 2
[0:32:21] <IamBagel> It's way less energy to be a scavenger than to hunt. Most animals are scavengers when appropriate
[0:32:21] <Justhoohaa> they hunt live prey
[0:32:22] <yourducky> tbh
[0:32:23] <Doccy> chat stop moving so i can ban that guy
[0:32:24] <ShrapTy> do these dudes actually know window smoke for 64 tick?
[0:32:26] <Doccy> paapoWeird
[0:32:27] <Puddin_Wing> Go ahead and clarify how pointing out that the game is 9 not 15 years old is semantics for me @Tommy_L33T

[0:34:19] <Puddin_Wing> You said CS GO was 15 years old. That's not semantics to correct, you're just wrong @Tommy_L33T
[0:34:34] <boxxythegoat> GOOD MORNIGN
[0:34:35] <Tommy_L33T> thats literally the diffinition of it
[0:34:41] <OldSpycey> if a male lion takes over a pride it kills al the previous males cubs and impregnates the females
[0:34:46] <Puddin_Wing> Arguing that you're factually incorrect is not semantics
[0:34:50] <Tommy_L33T> picking out one thing i said and playing games with it
[0:34:52] <Puddin_Wing> I think you need to work on that definition
[0:34:55] <uzumaki8362> thats just racist

[3:51:47] <Tank_Melts> @fl0m how far do you think liquid will make it
[3:51:49] <Puddin_Wing> yeah, lotta geometry and trig and then the physics of sound and how that applies @siiiif
[3:51:55] <siiiif> with the mix of theory and practical experience
[3:51:57] <LowRatedHighlander> @mentalstatemike nice!
[3:52:00] <Puddin_Wing> I know some of it, but I don't have the instinctive knack like my boss does at this point
[3:52:00] <1ntrested> i cant stop thinking about series like lucifer after watching it keep going in my mind what should i do
[3:52:03] <Mentalstatemike> NODDERS
[3:52:05] <STatisfacti0n> Yeah, I can see how getting swept up in that can happen when you put it that way. Just sucks when people can't see past their own vanity or see the bigger picture if you will. Especially with how far they went with AleksiB calling
[3:52:07] <sleeeeppyyyy> TL is out next round
[3:52:09] <Puddin_Wing> because of the practical experience, like you said

[3:53:39] <bigboy1520> Hey, @fl0m, is Silver cast VOD on Twitch private (could not find it in past broadcasts)? I loved the video, but still wanted to rewatch the whole stream, as I missed it due to time zones
[3:53:43] <destinction13> KEKPOINT sleeeeppyyyy
[3:53:52] <Kafkii> Good thing hunden is gone MmmHmm
[3:53:54] <STatisfacti0n> Liquid just needs 2016 fallen to keep showing up KEKW
[3:53:57] <LowRatedHighlander> @bigboy1520 all the vods are public boo
[3:53:58] <SuperTuscan888> I think Hunden will continue coaching and won't suffer any consequences
[3:54:00] <G3RONlMO> Confirmed: Fl0m thinks TL loses
[3:54:07] <rolf_stone_fist> woohoo is heroics new coach check hltv

[3:54:29] <bigboy1520> @LowRatedHighlander Might be blind then, I cant seem to find the silvercast one
[3:54:30] <SuperTuscan888> I think he's just under investigation
[3:54:39] <siiiif> Kafkii i mean it doesnt matter since nobody will hire him now
[3:54:42] <Puddin_Wing> I doubt it's private, it might just not be labeled. See if you can find a date where he mentioned it recentish on his twitter, then find a vod from then @bigboy1520
[3:54:43] <sleeeeppyyyy> TL will never see a trophy with this lineup. change my mind
[3:54:44] <LowRatedHighlander> @bigboy1520 most of the time it’s not labeled as such

[3:54:52] <Kafkii> You know some org will actually be that dumb siiiif

[4:11:14] <Uwotm08> Yeah I totally see what you mean! I have been saying since the beginning that unrated for CS wouldn't be fun either. :-)
[4:11:15] <vibing_kiwi> what can i do to get a free cs skin
[4:11:15] <ShrapTy> Valorant just requires more teamwork with utility to flash OP's off angles, etc. You cant be as self sufficient

[4:12:06] <bigfani> nothing really vibing_kiwi
[4:12:24] <vibing_kiwi> :(
[4:12:26] <teethirtyf0ur> I appreciate the constant surrendering in Valorant unranked. The games are long, and if one of the teams sucks it save time to just drop the game and move to another.
[4:12:27] <Puddin_Wing> why do you want 8chan back wasn't it fuckin awful? or was that like 7 or 6 im thinking of @bringback8chan
[4:12:28] <dotalegendery2> @vibing_kiwi  play the game and do beg on twitch chat
[4:12:32] <sevengaming_tv> Puddin_Wing does he dislike you or like money more though, is the question here peepoGiggles

[4:38:44] <jockst3r> back when I played and got my high rank I just sat in 40 min Q so I stoped playing
[4:39:07] <teethirtyf0ur> So there's kind of too much matchmaking control
[4:39:08] <spli7er> thats why i dont play valo solo
[4:39:13] <Diiingy> That is the exact reason why I stopped playing Valo
[4:39:29] <DavieWhy> peepoDJ Jammies peepoDJ
[4:39:30] <TyphloMusic> anyone should be able to queue with each other, just fix the matching system, they could fix it ez, they dont want to i feel like

[4:39:52] <Slugoxl> What are your thoughts on rainbow six @fl0m ?
[4:40:13] <TyphloMusic> faceit is sick for sure
[4:40:26] <ShrapTy> NA Faceit is not sick lol
[4:40:30] <Aceroni> It's crazy that a third party system is more sound than the game's system.
[4:40:32] <Slugoxl> faceit is tits
[4:40:34] <TyphloMusic> esea and faceit only for like 5 years now, totally worth it, gained so much
[4:40:39] <LowRatedHighlander> They definitely want to fix it problem is they want to fix it without third party systems

[6:56:00] <DW_Cijawasch> I played the game after one and half year yesterday , that wasn't a beautiful ,xD
[6:56:00] <GFYMeowMix> SuperTuscan888 it's really more annoying having a 75mph speed limit getting into phoenix with a 55mph limit on the freeway like ResidentSleeper
[6:56:08] <dark_abe> how fl0m is so chill
