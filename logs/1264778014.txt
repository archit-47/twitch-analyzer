[3:05:34] <Nightbot> hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
