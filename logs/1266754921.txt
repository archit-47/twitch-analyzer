[1:56:37] <iVex> I love meat OpieOP
[1:56:41] <jessmister> stop taking food from my foods mouth -.-
[1:56:44] <Puddin_Wing> Yeah thought so. "its so rare to hear people not rag on vegans" is the sorta thing you only hear from a vegan that gives people reasons to rag on vegans
[1:56:47] <deadbeatpete> @Floofys well when youre not ignorant and had a gf who was vegan for 3 years you realize the shit talk is just people having no idea what theyre saying haha
[1:57:03] <jockst3r> @Puddin_Wing KEKW
[1:57:20] <Floofys> @deadbeatpete Big time. I admit I got in because my BF is vegan but it's easier than I would have thought
[1:57:29] <mk_48> @Floofys there is a difference between someone having a vegan diet and a vegan. the latter ones are straight up annoying because they have to tell everyone that they are vegan. the first ones are ok
[1:57:29] <deadbeatpete> people only rag on vegans cause it became popular one day OMEGALUL

[1:58:08] <cosmic_sasquatch> omg
[1:58:11] <Floofys> @mk_48 I'd say vegan diet means you just watch what you eat and vegan means you also watch what you buy outside of food
[1:58:13] <deadbeatpete> @Floofys yeah same my gf was vegan and id still drink milk or eat meat just not really around her and not often i usually drink smoothies and eat like salmon and shit
[1:58:20] <mairiiis> @deadbeatpete Thats why i am vegan and eat meat. I can be popular and eat meat.
[1:58:29] <Puddin_Wing> you get that with most anything though. Same reason people beef with agnostics or atheists, has nothing to do with the beliefs and everything to do with the militant insistance on enforcing them on everyone @mk_48

[3:43:37] <Techno> - Musclebadger just re-subscribed for 29 months! fl0mPog
[3:43:40] <Puddin_Wing> You prestrafe too far. Like, you're taking off facing straight forwards or a little past straight, you wanna take off before you hit straight so your first strafe can gain more speed
[3:43:42] <SnowPirate> I don't know who feeny is and at this point i'm too afraid to ask YEP
[3:43:43] <Puddin_Wing> if that makes sense

[3:44:52] <Nightbot> We're getting animated sub emotes! But we need suggestions for what you want to see. So we created a form to put your suggestions in: https://forms.gle/3C4sk96BZDdnE1bHA Your suggestion can be wholly original or based on/a rework of an existing emote.
[3:44:54] <Puddin_Wing> your first strafe should be your biggest speed gain, and if you cut it short by prestrafing too far then your ljs are gonna suck
[3:44:55] <HarlowCS> now that I have the new emotes, ppHOP is not what I was expecting it to be
