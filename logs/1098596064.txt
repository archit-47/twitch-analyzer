[0:09:42] <SepiDrunk> Honestly I can't believe Astralis would put all their trust in the hands of an inexperienced player like Lucky. They needed an AWPer with enough whiffing experience to know that every shot matters. Someone who would complimented their DICKS for every nice round played. Someone who wouldn't think twice about abusing Namelock to get the advantage. Someone in command of a fl0mCult NOT A CULT fl0mCult that would scare their opponents. Astralis needed to sign fl0m, but they didn't deserve him Sadge

[0:19:35] <siiiif> one last encore pepeClap
[0:19:37] <SepiDrunk> Honestly I can't believe Astralis would put all their trust in the hands of an inexperienced player like Lucky. They needed an AWPer with enough whiffing experience to know that every shot matters. Someone who would complimented their DICKS for every nice round played. Someone who wouldn't think twice about abusing Namelock to get the advantage. Someone in command of a fl0mCult NOT A CULT fl0mCult that would scare their opponents. Astralis needed to sign fl0m, but they didn't deserve him Sadge

When your not online I'm watching the vods, when I run out of Vod's to watch I reenact my faviorite moments with family memebers at home. My mom loves to be a mod. She does so good at it. Either way. Your stream has given me new life and I can't thank you enough. You've finally earned my follow.

I have 10 computers worth over 10k each in order to drop new Steam Sales every few days. From now on I want you guys to call me "Gabe" and respect my right to get rich fast and discount needlessly.

[6:57:37] <StormbornVal> @Chezpuf thats right, i subscribe to another fat man on twitch
[6:57:40] <LowRatedHighlander> Yeah it would be out of place and they can barely get an unranked out they won‚Äôt do animated skins KEKW
[6:57:42] <thej6s> weird battlefield gun animations in CS KEKW
[6:57:44] <Darra5> Maybe your gun looks like a dragon.. oh no wait
[6:57:44] <theHovnival> Could we get post-round animations?maybe dances? like flossing?
[6:57:48] <JaYaJ> yes excited for something new smileW tired of the same old stuff ya know
[6:57:57] <chaoskompanie> trick or tactical reload animations
[6:57:59] <StormbornVal> @theHovnival pls stop
[6:58:00] <theHovnival> @the_ganznoob peepoHug
[6:58:06] <Chezpuf> StormbornVal obviously not, seeing from the lack of emote
[6:58:06] <The_Ganznoob> widepeepoBlanket
[6:58:09] <xrayjones1969> can we imagine just a bare chest and some beard wax slowly being rubbed in....
[6:58:12] <theHovnival> @stormbornval fl0mH
[6:58:12] <Justhoohaa> i like the prime skins... about it
[6:58:15] <priiide_> most of the skins i like in valorant arent really animated
[6:58:16] <two_drop> i think wear decals during the match would be cool with guns -- like the gun gets scuffed by grenades and whatnot
[6:58:21] <jacksparrowfan> prime for life
[6:58:24] <StormbornVal> fl0mH
[6:58:25] <sp_y> @Justhoohaa oni phantom?
[6:58:27] <Undoubted> apex legends has some good ones actually
[6:58:27] <Killer_Panda2k11> My take, the skins in Valorant look like ass
[6:58:31] <The_Ganznoob> Hoohoo widepeepoHappy
[6:58:31] <evil_m0rti> this team only pays OP
[6:58:33] <Justhoohaa> ok yea the oni is nice lol
[6:58:38] <evil_m0rti> OP globals
[6:58:41] <sp_y> lol oni is very nice
[6:58:44] <jeo_jostar> @Killer_Panda2k11 ngl I agree
[6:58:56] <StormbornVal> MercyWing1 @theHovnival MercyWing2
[6:58:58] <evil_m0rti> ok flom might not be washed
[6:59:01] <jacksparrowfan> prime vandal is the cleanest skins ever til date in Valorant... what do you guys think
[6:59:07] <a732v> COD has some skins that are out there, but I actually really like some of them
[6:59:11] <Justhoohaa> prim and singularity are really nice yo me
[6:59:12] <priiide_> do you like the ego skins fl0m ?
[6:59:12] <Justhoohaa> to*

[6:59:26] <The_Ganznoob> guys I had to wait 20 mins on my takeout at B dubs and they got me to go to the bar and buy two double Tito's and Red Bulls.... fuckin scammers fl0mSlam
[6:59:27] <stormshitman> voice lines is still one of the best ideas imo in terms of adding something cool to the game that has nothing that can break the game but just adds something cool

I strongly advise you not to mess with yourducky or consequences will be met in court. I hope you understand all the seriousness of the situation. Have a good day.

[7:49:08] <praeter15> There are no such things as "Legos". They don't exist. "Lego" refers to the COMPANY THAT MAKES THE TOY, and thus the shortening Lego is acceptable. Saying "I'm playing with my Lego" works because it's referring to the sets themselves: The individuals aspects that make of the toy from the bricks to the mini-figures to the electronics to the other little parts. It isn't claiming that the fucking square bricks are each a Lego.

[7:51:46] <yourducky> You can say that I was born to be a Twitch channel mod. I catch a glimpse of copypasta, the adrenaline starts pumping. A whiff of drama, I snap into duty. My streamer calls for a chat ban, I erase that motherfucker from the history books of this channel. There is no !command I won‚Äôt code, no timeout I won‚Äôt give, no Twitch laws I won‚Äôt overlook, and no order I won‚Äôt obey to make my streamer happy. And if you become his problem, well, I‚Äôm sorry to say that I‚Äôll become yours.
