[1:00:29] <Gittawat_> @barnumbirr  of course he's an 1000 years old wizard
[1:00:30] <stormshitman> i dunno sour cream does nothing to me tbh but i also think my stomach can handle legit anything
[1:00:43] <stove_pipe> Sour cream messes me up more than any other dairy
[1:00:44] <SnowPirate> Maybe it was just bad sour cream? just a bad batch
[1:00:45] <stormshitman> then again im kinda young so that might change it
[1:00:45] <barnumbirr> @Gittawat_ KEKW
[1:00:57] <Too_Restless> is Fl0m lactose intolerance?
[1:01:02] <Meinacanoe> The lactose free products actually have lactose but with lactaids, so if you eat or drink a lactose free product you can tolerate another food that has lactose at the same time
[1:01:02] <Darthrando> has tacos, blames the sour cream LUL
[1:01:03] <ChamposaurusWrex> Sour cream smells wrong to me so I don’t eat it
[1:01:09] <mofonkybee> Eats Tacos... gets stomach problems... blame it on the sour creme! LUL
[1:01:16] <chummydegenerate> sour cream is a nectar from the gods

[1:02:28] <praeter15> Call of Duty is objectively a better game than Counter Strike Global Offensive. Every Call of Duty comes out with a full campaign (which is amazing always) while CSGO does not come out with a campaign CoD has much more customization of the guns and skins (why would i want to use a gun that i cant customize at all) each gun having 6000 attachments and only 5 of them being viable is a great thing for the game
[1:02:29] <hobrev> I feel like if it was undercooked or bad meat it would be a bit more of a thing
[1:02:29] <acetamino> They say it’s the meal prior to the most recent food

[3:33:06] <dolev801> np
[3:33:09] <the_kung> @ChamposaurusWrex the a4 has a slightly higher fire rate indeed but due to the increased damage of the a1 it kills faster if you hit all bullets

[6:37:25] <AFugy> Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because he was already dead.

[6:53:32] <iizarian> @williamthawforns would you be streaming from home? cause if you would be, wouldn't you technically be "working" since you'd be streaming. smooth brain logic
[6:53:33] <shaveski> flom its a simple question
[6:53:37] <InfinityReign> fl0m i know you're not my real dad but can you give me advice my real dad would give me?

[6:53:46] <esserb23> sounds like a good way to get fired lol
[6:53:56] <williamthawforns> true i will refrain @esserb23
[6:54:00] <FlameyKumori> being a small time streamer ain't worth losing your job over
[6:54:16] <jockst3r> @williamthawforns as long as you do your work and dont get fired then yes you can stream "while" working its up to you lol
[6:54:17] <williamthawforns> hahahahaha @iizarian im desperate here for an answer but i got it
[6:54:25] <sjoerdtheman> paapoWeird actually his first day on twitch
[6:54:36] <ak40ozzz> im sure you can game while working from home and still do a good job depending on what you do, but streaming takes too much effort to actually get work done at the same time
[6:54:37] <destr028> fl0m always last alive?? XD
[6:54:38] <AFugy> I've seen bounty hunters stream, wood workers, do you do something people want to watch?

[8:40:33] <TheRenegadeRonin> @alex_zd1998 yep YEP
[8:40:53] <MANIKcc> they were supposed to release another game but it kept getting delayed/restructured.. so I think they just kind of gave up or something.. When they renamed it PUBG:Battlegrounds you knew it wasn't gonna end well
