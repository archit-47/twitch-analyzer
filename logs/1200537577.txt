[1:10:49] <Killer_Panda2k11> Oh shit fnx will win another major peepoChrist
[1:10:52] <sevengaming_tv> tarik took a break and found a bag
[1:10:52] <Gumberino> No way that can go wrong lmfao
[1:10:57] <sevengaming_tv> Moneytalk
[1:11:01] <lolypop98> tarik is killing it with his stream, the dude is so funny
[1:11:01] <ImTarco> Yo when we getting Luminosity Fox back tho?
[1:11:15] <Sealer9> tarik has 10k subs chillin in his bedroom. he is not coming back to cs
[1:11:20] <STatisfacti0n> fl0m you should rebuild luminosity
[1:11:21] <4Snails> I would miss Traik too much if he left to play pro again
[1:11:24] <issBanoo> stew would coach rather than stream imo
[1:11:26] <YRNFrederick> dudes chilling at 9k subs getting a bag
[1:11:28] <AMutantCookie> Tarik to mythic NODDERS
[1:11:31] <bk8990> 1TAP
[1:11:32] <STatisfacti0n> and then let NAF take over your spot again to rebuild NA CS
[1:11:38] <hobrev> :D

[1:11:47] <ImTarco> Wait if Tarik goes full time streamer, Tarik to Mythic is... possible-ish.
[1:11:55] <Archit47> Clap is bad
[1:11:59] <officer_ant> Im glad tarik took his time after EG, he's developed into a top tier streamer. Seems to be pretty happy

[1:12:08] <AatishSai> tarik said is NA CS there is no one to scrim with and have to move to EU if you are serious about the comp. scene. And tarik does not want to move to EU so I guess he will not be back anytime soon
[1:12:10] <vchair23> if stew does leave liquid , wonder if there was a split on how much time should be spent in Europe- granted it's a lot already, but if you want the best practice it could be even more

[1:26:00] <vso11> KEKW
[1:26:00] <AJJay> The flag wasn’t for running into the ref
[1:26:02] <dbleday> He just wanted to get a feel of that thigh @fl0m
[1:26:05] <G0urami> KEKW
[1:26:06] <ImTarco> Already had his hand on the flag.
[1:26:06] <froster5226> then he holds his fucking hand up like he just hit a 3 pointer (yes i stole this comment from reddit)
[1:26:07] <officer_ant> bro time for a new job
[1:26:07] <NERVg> Tony Corrente was already known as an ass ref tbh
[1:26:08] <Trojan_SK> KEKW
[1:26:09] <MrFortyOz> He had his life savings on the steelers winning
[1:26:09] <fr0stbb> SUS
[1:26:09] <hceqi> wtf is this shit, get that ref out
[1:26:10] <RyN_UP> ref said in a post game interview that it had nothing to do with the call
[1:26:10] <NERVg> This makes it worse
[1:26:12] <Killer_Panda2k11> It's super sus
[1:26:14] <dakota_runs> Wasn't it a taunting penalty on another player though???? @fl0m

[1:26:34] <sphhax> homie said WeirdEyes and got a flag
[1:26:35] <G0urami> NO LOOKING NOPERS
[1:26:36] <dweevers> fl0m that is the problem with the leagues "emphasis" on taunting this year
[1:26:36] <STatisfacti0n> they need to get rid of taunting so fucking bad
[1:26:37] <a732v> Are the steelers ok after being taunted like that?????
[1:26:38] <AJJay> He was already gonna throw the flag, it’s weird af tho
[1:26:39] <Killer_Panda2k11> The taunt wasn't even a taunt. It was just a staredown
[1:26:39] <luckinout1> that's 100% intentional
[1:26:40] <SiestaKing_> NFL = NO FUN LEAGUE
[1:26:41] <priiide_> WeirdEyes at the bench
[1:26:42] <WookiePotamus> and the sweet ass round house kick
[1:26:42] <RaWShankNasty> Play it one more time lol
[1:26:42] <dbleday> it's like being at the strip club and can only look at the floor @fl0m
[1:26:43] <LadyHoodsama> either the best or worst timing ive ever seen
[1:26:44] <froster5226> @G3RONlMO it's legal on a federal scale now (but some states restrict gambling like mine)
[1:26:46] <Kurintoi> Cant be looking now WeirdEyes
[1:26:47] <G0urami> DONT LOOKING NOPERS
[1:26:49] <FlameyKumori> You're not allowed to taunt? What is this OWL?
[1:26:50] <SukksGaming> Well, maybe he shouldnt play 4Head
[1:26:51] <FatalOne> well for context he played for the steelers buy they didnt give him a chance so it was a little personal
[1:26:53] <RaWShankNasty> oof
[1:26:53] <STatisfacti0n> no 👁️ 👁️
[1:26:55] <ChosenDew> WeirdEyes at the bench. Penalty
[1:26:55] <yobtih> the NFL is boring, more commericals than actual game play
[1:26:55] <qujamm> that happened in college football a few weeks ago too.. just refs throwing games
[1:26:59] <SoporificPanda> 🟨 ILLEGAL USE OF EYES
[1:27:01] <LtNotzoClutch> They don't call this bitch the Windy City for the weather

[1:27:17] <stormshitman> can refs calm down
[1:27:18] <GFYMeowMix> @dweevers brooo they made some changes to fix the no FUN league but this season the BS 'taunting' calls are full 1 step forward 3 steps back

[1:27:26] <AMutantCookie> refs got bullied in school
[1:27:29] <ImTarco> NFL players boutta be wearing horse blinders.

[1:27:32] <dweevers> GFYMeowMix it's 100% fucking dumb, but that's on the league not the refs
[1:27:33] <waduheckfossy> insecure refs
[1:27:35] <yobtih> Valve should ban refs
[1:27:36] <Spider22Monkey> almost as bad at the packers/seahawk call from years ago when they couldn't decide if it was a catch or interception
[1:27:37] <Killer_Panda2k11> @yobtih Technically this happened in a IRL Madden 22 game KEKW
[1:27:38] <hobrev> since ed hochuli retired the level has really dipped in the ref pool

[1:30:42] <yobtih> Crungo
[1:30:45] <0kayg3> ccastro called u best
[1:30:46] <KNAPKINAT0R> you think if vitality play with the roster they have rn its gonna be top tier or nah
[1:30:48] <ImTarco> Fucking FIFA, I do not get it.
[1:30:52] <DarkKnightGenesis> KEKW
[1:30:57] <Sealer9> the first 2 rounds at blast aren't even on stage. so lame
[1:31:04] <dankiyy> run it down mid Kappa

[1:31:15] <dweevers> Kurintoi even then it's hard to get the right angle to see what happened on camera. The NFL uses like 27 cameras and it still doesn't get all the right looks

[3:00:54] <fluidfirexx> ok
[3:00:55] <BunchOfNaps> @BIFF_pz laptops are cheaper but if you can get a pc do that
[3:00:57] <wesinat0r> I'm slightly better aiming rifles on a lower sens but can't AWP. Too much of a tradeoff.
[3:00:59] <roachfrags> @dhairya_chheda a desktop PC will always be better value and likely last longer (no batteries to get old, easily upgradeable)
[3:01:02] <STatisfacti0n> @dhairya_chheda but if you do the majority of your gaming at home, a desktop
[3:01:08] <BoomingBusiness> surely someone takes these odds on the doubt
[3:01:09] <abhi007bond> %? 69
[3:01:10] <Nightbot> Joris says 19%
[3:01:12] <STatisfacti0n> also what roach said
[3:01:16] <abhi007bond> !1deag
[3:01:16] <Nightbot> abhi007bond pops a 1deag on nikklez_ 1TAP
[3:01:19] <STatisfacti0n> better value per dollar
[3:01:21] <roachfrags> but a good gaming laptop is fine if you need something portable. just know it's gonna cost more and have a shorter lifespan @dhairya_chheda
[3:01:36] <Nomad182> ^^^

[5:47:29] <lordoutlaw> murica
[5:47:37] <LowRatedHighlander> @maplethe2nd he almost played mythic
[5:47:43] <AMutantCookie> looks like no
[5:47:54] <sloveCS> i have never enforced it
[5:47:57] <staminaw0w> Agents are allowed in premier..
[5:48:01] <Maplethe2nd> @LowRatedHighlander ahh must have watched the tryout match
[5:48:04] <staminaw0w> So i think people are using them now because of that.
[5:48:15] <chillie_eu> Is the thing stewie true
[5:48:18] <Scape000> @fl0m why do some people not like it
[5:48:19] <AMutantCookie> I think they're not "too" bad anymore are they?
[5:48:23] <Scape000> @fl0m harder to see?
[5:48:25] <sloveCS> well the esea plugin still blocks the original skins
[5:48:26] <m00ki3> Imagine if moving forward Major MVP gets a player skin in the game
[5:48:30] <m00ki3> thatd be sick
[5:48:30] <LowRatedHighlander> @scape000 yes
[5:48:31] <Notifly> Scape000, yes
[5:48:34] <LowRatedHighlander> With certain skins
[5:48:40] <sloveCS> @fl0m they still do, but it doesnt work on the new agents
[5:48:43] <HSorWhiff> It only doesnt work on the new agents
[5:48:45] <staminaw0w> Correct, but speaking with the admins, because it's allowed at the major they aren't going to update it.
[5:48:54] <G3RONlMO> 144 ADR and 1 kill, feels bad
[5:49:04] <iizarian> lmao
[5:49:06] <AFugy> KEKPOINT
[5:49:06] <praeter15> dude had G2 going thru OMEGALUL
[5:49:07] <KNAPKINAT0R> that would be sick, if they had the normal agents with the major trophy on the back for the winners
[5:49:10] <CortanaLXIX> KEKPOINT fr3nk1e
[5:49:10] <AMutantCookie> Well Valve want them used don't they
[5:49:14] <NERVg> Hey that gold coin is rare tho
[5:49:14] <HSorWhiff> @fl0m Do you know why not a single agent skin was used at the Major?

[5:50:14] <KNAPKINAT0R> how cool would it be if the major champions got the stock skin but with the major trophy on the back of it so its still standard but different
[5:50:18] <dweevers> HSorWhiff players had a gentleman's agreement not to use them
[5:50:23] <pichupowerd> @Prust_Plays its ok the cold coin is rarer!!!
[5:50:23] <Uwotm08> @DolphinBeers That's probably ESEA showing just 1.
[5:50:28] <AMutantCookie> Unless its boston Diamond the rest aren't that hard imo
[5:50:30] <pichupowerd> gold coin*
[5:50:35] <HSorWhiff> @dweevers its crazy we still have to do that.  ty I wasnt sure
[5:50:36] <ImTarco> That's a semi-pro kill right there Kappa
[5:50:37] <techa17> My friend woulda had diamond if he locked in pepeLaughing

[6:01:41] <natas_k> ROF is dogshit SeemsGood
[6:01:43] <theBaboda> can you still one tap with it? or did they nerf that a long time ago? i haven't used it in years
[6:01:46] <Zarjio> Ah, so it's a slow poo, like constipation.
[6:01:52] <entea> truly a noob cannon back then KEKW @EfnMD
[6:01:54] <Prust_Plays> theBaboda still one tap viable
[6:01:57] <LtNotzoClutch> Did you try that smoked brisket bowl from Chipotle yet?
[6:02:00] <thehazattack> then niko starts playing with it in the semi finals randomly PepeLaugh
[6:02:01] <speciality_> I main xm and two flashes
[6:02:05] <LtNotzoClutch> If so, any good?
[6:02:06] <curpyx> did stickers release yet
[6:02:07] <1xxela> @LtNotzoClutch not that good imo
[6:02:12] <yobtih> the auto is actually a viable weapon people are just afraid to be called a pussy
[6:02:13] <artifalacial> tell that to niko
[6:02:18] <theBaboda> I only ask because I used it in Silver to only headshot people PepeLaugh
[6:02:18] <praeter15> make the krieg a val gun and make it ADS the current fire rate and unscoped the old fire rate peepoSit
[6:02:25] <entea> that strikes at the greatest fear of any CS player @yobtih
[6:02:32] <RyanGDS> but they talk about my 1 taps
[6:02:40] <zyrecet> Niko taps?
[6:02:42] <LtNotzoClutch> @1xxela Damn. Cause it looked delish. That's a shame
[6:02:42] <thehazattack> B1T would do pretty well with it
[6:02:44] <cardboardtoast> AWPER: its all about spray :D
[6:02:51] <MaxofMine> @thehazattack for some reason Niko decided to not use it when it was broken, but now that it’s not good he’s gone, I will learn this gun now.
[6:02:52] <NERVg> so the kreig is the best gun in valorant got it
[6:02:52] <lootpackrs> @yobtih im just more afraid of the other team using it better

[6:03:23] <BizarreMark> MmmHmm Niko uses the krieg after the meta is done, he built diff.

[8:30:17] <l3ordon> I tried showing a girl my Stattrack blue gem, she told me I was a nerd and left my 60th story penthouse
[8:30:17] <bonkerz93> @maybeDuck true
[8:30:19] <Shotgun_Chef> @fl0m your inventory is worth more than your car also
[8:30:23] <carboxylate1> @siiiif low but never zero monkaHmm
[8:30:25] <Eightred> cars depreciate faster than skins though
[8:30:27] <HeyKroZ_> POGGERS  arya
[8:30:31] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m I'll give u 5 gifted for all ur skins smileW
[8:30:34] <dasfuzion> fl0m do u know anything about cars or no?
[8:30:35] <GiraffePig> @Shotgun_Chef depends which car you're talking about
[8:30:37] <siiiif> carboxylate1 maybe if you try every day... monkaHmm
[8:30:38] <Doccy> 20k supreme shirt
[8:30:38] <Phoneutria> arya with these flicks man

[8:30:50] <jgrasp_> @fl0m other than a knife you could honestly have a pretty nice inventory for like $50. The expensive skins aren't always the better looking ones
