[2:05:21] <ayaz555> what do you think happens if kenny pops off this iem winter @fl0m
[2:05:22] <almostcooltho> Kenny is like a princess locked away in a tower Sadge call Shrek
[2:05:24] <SpykerLOL> S1mple being oldskool and Zywoo is newskool
[2:05:25] <MANIKcc> explosive in different ways
[2:05:25] <HamNchZ> can you articulate the difference?

[2:05:41] <DimitriPascaluta> when we interviewed anders he put it best: zywoo is the perfect player, s1mple is the impossible player
[2:05:50] <audio_noodle> @fl0m why is the vp logo a polarbear btw, it always confused me lol
[2:05:51] <kayyyyyy____> idk having a major winner as a 6th man in kenny is a bit op
[2:05:57] <silviu_cs> I've seen several people arguing b1t had a more insane rookie year than ZywOo individually, which is just mad to me
[2:06:04] <Darkoplax> s1mple took 4 years to become godlike while ZywOo hit the ground running from his rookie year
[2:06:05] <ancalagon9608> honestly i think zywoo is the better player, but s1mple has a bit more impact consistently
[2:06:16] <frunkey> @DimitriPascaluta are u wiht the scoreesports?

[2:07:43] <Nightbot> idk man not anyone right meow other than josh cause HOTDOGGERS
[2:07:44] <crypt1ci_i> i can see more with Faze but g2 makes no sense
[2:07:45] <iExpertxC4x> Is shox going to liquid or its just a rumor ?
[2:07:46] <XeeVzz> i think faze ropz is a better option
[2:07:47] <mukulhayaran> og ropz? Prayge
[2:07:48] <FletcherB10> yea but twistzz doesn't need to play the superstar role
[2:07:48] <ayaz555> rops for EG?
[2:07:49] <purvikpatel_> thoughts on brehze switching to valorant ?
[2:07:53] <Darkoplax> ropz play B anchor so 1:1 replacement for JaCkz
[2:07:57] <frunkey> @DimitriPascaluta Are you with the score esports?
[2:08:02] <Sealer9> you don't think being back with karrrigan would help him?
[2:08:03] <illastration1> G2 have m0nesy so it‚Äôs no option
[2:08:04] <YanEM> Unless Twist swiches teams (wich I doubt)
[2:08:10] <andylo812> g2 STEW?
[2:08:10] <jaaaaaaamin> they can do like twistz elige with twistz ropz no?
[2:08:11] <njgyaani> faze have twist and g2 has hunter wtf ropz gonna do in both those team @fl0m
[2:08:12] <kayyyyyy____> ropz for Liquid?
[2:08:15] <ekayeem> Furia kicking VINI really triggered me.

[2:08:56] <frunkey> @DimitriPascaluta ayo, i like u man u make me watch that shit when ur hosting a story
[2:09:00] <F1niteCS> fl0m co-host chat proves no one ever gives thought to player roles/compatibility KEKW just roll a player dice and a team dice and ask the streamer their opinion on the combo
[2:09:01] <uberargyle> i've seen nexa do the last round saves a couple times too. never made sense to me
[2:09:01] <njgyaani> jackz is such a self less player man props to him @fl0m
[2:09:02] <Noob3r> jams
[2:09:02] <Darkoplax> Jame clutch ?
[2:09:08] <Darkoplax> Jame wins these
[2:09:11] <Darkoplax> or not
[2:09:14] <Archit47> VAC
[2:09:14] <Simoxfox> frozen can actually fit in these teams better than ropz probably

[2:09:17] <mcquacken_og> VAC
[2:09:18] <mukulhayaran> OOOO

[2:09:53] <kayyyyyy____> ropz to liquid
[2:09:56] <silviu_cs> ropz seems like the kind of player that needs his team set around him
[2:09:57] <kayyyyyy____> instead of shox
[2:09:58] <Paasss> probably means Rain gets more bitch roles if ropz goes to faze

[2:10:44] <iSiddhant> hey what are your thoughts on fl0m replacing s1mple on navi?
[2:11:00] <illastration1> M4A1-S is too strong. CT side is easy mode atm
[2:11:01] <HamNchZ> i can tell when a team is in sync and whgen there are competing egos
[2:11:02] <owpog> can m0nsey play at majors? isnt he like 16 @fl0m
[2:11:02] <audio_noodle> @fl0m do you think monkey peeking has a fall off point in terms of skill level lol

[2:12:54] <chaddeviidash> @froux01 2K
[2:12:57] <stormvm> I think you can play when you're 16, but you have to have your parents sign an agreement
[2:13:02] <audio_noodle> @fl0m why does it feel like people just walk one by one to zywoo, i know it's mostly his positioning and game sense, but it shouldn't be impossible to play around

[2:16:30] <jaaaaaaamin> hs through a wall worst case scenario idk
[2:16:30] <Fl3mington> I definitely do
[2:16:31] <carboxylate1> @mayhemagent misutaa
[2:16:38] <raindeathroses> say if you shoot someone in the head with ak through a panel or door it will do less damage with helmet?
[2:16:40] <Semiproshark7> It‚Äôs all nice til u get 1 tapped by a galil
[2:16:40] <J0hnnyWP> also if you died to galil when they could be low or half buying to 2k id be heated
[2:16:49] <mukulhayaran> %? 69
[2:16:50] <Nightbot> Joris says 12%
[2:16:50] <TH0R_95> helmet can make a diff in a wallbang spam, so it's worth it on Vertigo
[2:16:51] <grandmaster_hag> i believe there was stat that RPK waste most money on unnesecery armor rebuy
[2:16:53] <magmaster21> Doesn‚Äôt head armor also lessen nade damage
[2:16:54] <ak_boy0> !trade
[2:16:54] <BonBonVal> helmet + wallbang = 2nd chance
[2:16:54] <Nightbot> No fl0m doesn't want to trade or give you skins. AND NO this chat is NOT a trading forum. You will be bonked.
[2:17:07] <mayhemagent> Damn.

[2:17:15] <im_always_infamous> @raindeathroses  do you know 3klicksphilip?
[2:17:20] <BonBonVal> thats why he is the tank
[2:17:22] <praeter15> i wonder if having a helmet would help from getting wallbanged
[2:17:22] <audio_noodle> the true chads never buy head armour Kappa
[2:17:23] <Semiproshark7> Also pros used to go mac10 because no head armor

[3:01:45] <BooomerNinja> +Jane +Jane +Jane +Jane +Jane Roster would overtake Navi NODDERS
[3:01:45] <mukulhayaran> NODDERS
[3:01:47] <toxicwastedcloud> idk how i feel about g2 roster changes after that major
[3:01:53] <SlamDeath> @Terie54 god I miss that porcupine, wonder how he's doing in valorant
[3:01:56] <sir1pu> do you think NIP can put up a fight without dev1ce??
[3:01:59] <toxicwastedcloud> think they should give it a bit more time
[3:02:00] <praeter15> what did G2 change fl0m
[3:02:01] <Achapman18> all these roster changes gonna be dope
[3:02:02] <Terminat0r44> if u aint first youre last
[3:02:05] <cl_angeleyes> vp down?
[3:02:06] <Vitalityy__> @fl0m nono goal is 5th place you misunderstand, who wants to be number 1?? too much stress yes
[3:02:10] <bolottekid> KEKWait get right and pimp get the valorant watch party rights
[3:02:12] <toxicwastedcloud> true
[3:02:13] <jeevesses> Imagine NiKo with Zywoo man
[3:02:14] <yobtih> Niko PogChamp
[3:02:16] <debux> NO JACKZ HE IS TOO HANDSOME
[3:02:20] <SandwichSundays> PepeHands
[3:02:20] <Terie54> @Terie54 i think he has been benched or something
[3:02:22] <gardenae> Fallen
[3:02:22] <toxicwastedcloud> true true

[3:02:43] <slavv_boss> People only remember bad moments, they forgot if not niko, g2 wouldnt be in the final
[3:02:44] <esc_artist> gg whats next
[3:02:50] <vzylexy> Niko's performance in the Major was fuckin insane
[3:02:53] <TacticalAlmonds> yall really think that Niko, Device, Zywoo, Elige, Stew, Karrigan, Glave wanna be second best? no. They won't be satisfied until they're number 1.
[3:02:58] <Terie54> Hunter was dissappointing for me, as was Nexa. I expected much better from them
[3:03:08] <vzylexy> Yeah, I believe so fl0m
[3:03:08] <TheSolaceXD> why forgor about niko mens
[3:03:19] <Achapman18> thats insane
[3:03:34] <praeter15> why be #1 team when you can be #1 player
[3:03:35] <nikollaaa> what do u think about monesey to g2?
[3:03:37] <dnillo> fl0m isnt vitality supposed to keep apex, zywoo, and misutaaa?
[3:03:48] <ekstraLUV> also in that nuke game, it was because of niko's plays outside that g2 got that mane roundds in the first place
[3:03:51] <im_always_infamous> #rigged xD
[3:03:57] <ekstraLUV> *many
[3:04:01] <praeter15> KEKWait magisk and dupreeh
[3:04:06] <Mumflr830> its weird seeing fl0m co streaming iem
[3:04:07] <stingerfury> Scary Lineup monkaW
[3:04:10] <yobtih> i actually think zonic as coach is the biggest thing there
[3:04:15] <Gour204> do you think that line will compete on same level of navi ?
[3:04:16] <plozi89> idk @fl0m I think niko is taking too much space to let his team shine as well, no matter who will be on that team
[3:04:17] <toxicwastedcloud> honestly love seeing KennyS play again
[3:04:17] <praeter15> who is calling for them then fl0m KEKWait
[3:04:18] <juraj20000> Is it confirmed ?
[3:04:23] <OGWerp> I wonder where vitalitys current coaach is gonna go
[3:04:24] <SandwichSundays> that's confirmed?
[3:04:29] <jimmygotit> get s1mple too best team in esport history
[3:04:31] <jimmygotit> easily
[3:04:40] <Terie54> I feel like the new Vitality lineup looks good on paper but will fail, just seems like the team is split in half in this scenario, no cohesion

[3:05:25] <yobtih> rolling start?
[3:05:30] <D1srvpts> I think if you put together like roster with players like fl0m, Lex, Jojo, Slugy, and JDubs they could be very successful

[3:07:50] <OLDHeliotrope> imagine russian army sponsored it
[3:07:56] <Terminat0r44> @jokkerbo Airforce and 'Army' KEKW
[3:07:56] <caraigggg> The Shox clutch  vs the famas wins it for Vitality
[3:07:56] <praeter15> theres pictures of the setup somewhere
[3:07:58] <stormshitman> i have seen them before its like a plastic Perspex a fan in the fan cams one day showed it off and flexed it
[3:08:00] <TacticalAlmonds> @jokkerbo Armed services sponsor anything. Anything they can get their name on for propaganda.  If I started an org tomorrow, they'd sponsor it
[3:08:06] <BonamantTV> In this economy?

[3:08:13] <praeter15> i think theres a picture of S1mple signing the box they put around the camera
[3:08:15] <Cacemen> EZ
[3:08:17] <mukulhayaran> %? 69
[3:08:17] <SpykerLOL> personally I think ESL should invest in better headsets with "pro" microphones so the voices of the desk are clearer and crispier. These sound muffled and bass is gone
[3:08:19] <KettamemeCS> it's not 0% peepoFoil
[3:08:26] <Nightbot> Latest video: WTF is going on in this CS:GO Game!? - https://youtu.be/RdpKJJP8_ck
[3:08:33] <D1srvpts> %? 40% loss for VP
[3:08:33] <Nightbot> Joris says 69%
[3:08:33] <jokkerbo> @Terminat0r44 DoD
[3:08:35] <Speedrulez> any rules modCheck
[3:08:36] <alpinestartgate> it's definitely some kind of glass cover, it's also easier to sign those since they're flat, unlike the lens which is curved

[4:10:36] <random_factz> Hello guys, I'm back from my 600 seconds timeout. During that time I was able to finish my 200 words essay on the topic of Hitboy‚Äôs Hairline. My thesis is that Hitboy‚Äôs Hairline is receding by almost an inch every day. As an instinctive response, this makes Hitboy mad which supports my conclusion that Hitboy is in fact malding. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.  fl0mSmorting

[6:01:33] <Gigabo0123> He plays the percentage a lot of the time so if his team isn't in a position to win the round he isn't going to be taking risks to pull them across the line

[6:01:34] <sharkey3322> doesnt try to take over the round
[6:01:35] <LowRatedHighlander> Ewy_Qwarp hey boo

[6:01:47] <Terie54> Plopski averaged a 0.88 rating at the Major, thats not anywhere close to good enough, people like to focus on Rez but Plopski has been poor
[6:01:49] <moosE3knucklE> ayeeee me and kennyS have the same exact rose tattoo except mine is on my right hand lol
[6:01:54] <bee_void> i wonder what the NIP pre-device looks like right now in an alternate universe. they were young and inexperienced for sure but they were for sure on the up and up.
