[0:48:04] <Puddin_Wing> @Sizzo158 except i'm not as rich as fry
[0:48:06] <soalsoalsoal> What I saw about OF was that the news is misreported and that they are just not going to show porn content on their TV app.    but im just going off a random dude in a discord so what do i know

[1:09:19] <MicaDee> Silvercast deserves the best, yes
[1:09:20] <bolottekid> sadgeBusinessTime
[1:09:22] <yobtih> so actually 40 months is not almost 2 years, it's more than that. 12 months is a year so 40 divided by 12 is 3.33 (repeating of course) so it's actually closer to 4 years at this point
[1:09:35] <PerhapsItsPeach> I'm actively working on getting silver fl0m, can i compete from eu PauseFish
[1:09:35] <LowRatedHighlander> @fl0m if you want I’m silver KEKW

[3:05:47] <LucidR9> aetherealphoenix if it's not running or jump throw it will work on 64 tick
[3:05:52] <Nomad182> ratJAM
[3:05:53] <justT1LT> aetherealphoenix the walking throw while you go down the stairs?

[3:06:08] <LucidR9> he comms more as a dog than he does in premiere
[3:06:11] <aetherealphoenix> i think walking but i full run and throw it hits 90% of the time @justT1LT
[3:06:14] <bolottekid> peepoHigh
[3:06:17] <JuiceW4H> if the lineup requires you running or jumping it is very different
[3:06:19] <aetherealphoenix> I really liked his form for that molly
[3:06:25] <justT1LT> aetherealphoenix yeah then itll work on 64 tick
[3:06:26] <LucidR9> just sayin

[3:06:42] <LucidR9> SoporificPanda dont make me kiss you
[3:06:49] <Nomad182> @aetherealphoenix I actually tested it this week. the one thrown from the back wall works but you've got to fiddle with the crosshair a bit
[3:06:52] <justT1LT> aetherealphoenix the only types of smokes that dont work on 64 tick are the ones that require a jumpthrow bind
[3:06:54] <kopiiite> is mythic playing frag? monkaGIGA
[3:06:55] <LucidR9> aetherealphoenix 64 tick and 128 smokes will work interchangably if they are not jumping or running
[3:06:55] <MaybeBrando> Flom I need motivation to go to work and do adult things topday
[3:06:59] <SoporificPanda> LucidR9 don't threaten me with a good time
[3:07:05] <LucidR9> justT1LT I believe running smokes are different too
[3:07:07] <LuxionGames> sauceboy does what he wants
[3:07:13] <justT1LT> LucidR9 nah i dont think so
[3:07:15] <LucidR9> get this man on mirage fl0mSlam

[3:07:37] <aetherealphoenix> yeah that I am sure @LucidR9 however there may be some small hiccups on some like the connector smoke from T-ramp on mirage
[3:07:38] <kopiiite> LowRatedHighlander ty
[3:07:44] <justT1LT> LucidR9 i mean the reason they dont work is because of the jumping height diff on 64 tick and 128 tick
[3:07:47] <n0r13k> He's a Mirage pugger.
[3:07:49] <LucidR9> the difference is when the grenade is thrown 64 tick jump throws go much farther than 128 tick ones I believe
[3:07:50] <SICK0> this is what happens when you invite them to the discord
[3:07:53] <r_udra> sauce boy throwing non mirage pug tell me about it KEKW
[3:07:55] <n0r13k> What do you expect.
[3:07:56] <aetherealphoenix> also thanks @Nomad182

[4:08:22] <AIR02000> it is surprising to see the 2 of the 3 most viewed esports game are owned by Valve
[4:08:24] <Drakeoner69> CSGO and TF2 give valve tons of money, they don't need to update their game.
[4:08:27] <sol1taire> did you ever play red alert?
[4:08:29] <Belegdhor> is valve forcing you to say you like cs

[4:10:48] <a6dice> I have been playing csgo for up to 5000 hours now, sometimes it feels pretty stupid cu I am not doing anything with it, like streaming etc
[4:10:51] <bolottekid> 1TAP DELETED

[4:11:08] <SoporificPanda> i remember when we had thanos automodded FeelsBadMan
[4:11:09] <slimrick6> Cs has been on the decline since it became free to play
[4:11:10] <ShaneAJM> I think valve just needs more involvement in the competitive aspect/updates for newer players. The game is good but I feel like there needs to be some rank adjustments.
[4:11:10] <STatisfacti0n> @LowRatedHighlander yeah I mentioned that one earlier LUL
