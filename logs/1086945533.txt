[0:09:23] <ninetyfivemonkeys> did you guys practice offline or somethin
[0:09:23] <Nightbot> H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)

[1:40:09] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree

[2:06:42] <Nightbot> This argument is horrible. People said the same about Lance Armstrong back in the day. "He definitely won't cheat" is a bad argument, people cheat. Guys that are the face of charities like Armstrong cheat, all us humans have the capability to cheat inside.

[2:07:40] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree

[2:14:54] <Nightbot> Mythic needs to place top 4 in the relegation tournament to keep their spot in Premier https://www.hltv.org/events/5983/esea-premier-season-37-north-america-relegation If they win this BO3, they stay in Premier. If they lose, they go to Advanced.
