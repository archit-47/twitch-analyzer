[0:20:44] <Zacolian> You ever play Immortal Redneck? @fl0m
[0:20:46] <420Enigma> @LucidR9 truuueeee
[0:21:07] <LucidR9> if your FOV isnt high enough that the player model cuts off because the devs thought no one would be insane enough to play with an FOV that high are you really a pc gamer
[0:21:23] <LowRatedHighlander> so whats the objective here
[0:21:30] <LucidR9> win @LowRatedHighlander
[0:21:44] <Pappy_Pud> I'm from Louisiana, I'm pretty sure that makes me an immortal redneck

[0:22:28] <DrBlutarsky> did you get the chest in the portal??

[0:31:09] <r_udra> Peepo
[0:31:10] <Puddin_Wing> I still think you'd really like Ziggurat 2. They've been consistently updating it and it's pretty polished at this point. Super twitchy first person roguelite like this, but the weapons are magicky, you can carry 4, and the enemies are batshit goofy @fl0m
[0:31:16] <aetherealphoenix> it probably would be @fl0m
[0:31:21] <aetherealphoenix> it's an absolute blast
[0:31:21] <drivel___> Man I really wish I knew where that second channel is
[0:31:21] <H3lte> possilby
[0:31:25] <LowRatedHighlander> hey feeny
[0:31:29] <LowRatedHighlander> how you doin
[0:31:36] <r_udra> feeny is here OOOO
[0:31:37] <mitkel_> whats up flom
[0:31:40] <Puddin_Wing> and like 10 chars and a bunch of shit to unlock as you progress so it's got the constant upgrades like this @fl0m
[0:31:41] <r_udra> +1
[0:31:42] <420Enigma> @Puddin_Wing wait Ziggurat has a sequel?
[0:31:44] <brbMike> Hell tyeah

[0:31:54] <InfinityReign> what kinda bad game feeny trying to get you on
[0:31:57] <H3lte> I loved the first one
[0:31:58] <biZZski> nova drift is a small game
[0:32:03] <dankiyy> cigarette 2? peepoIQ
[0:32:04] <biZZski> but its fun as hell
[0:32:09] <LucidR9> the first governmental/religious structure known to man and fl0m cant pronounce it
[0:32:09] <LowRatedHighlander> its early access and is 1gb
[0:32:10] <Puddin_Wing> It's got a ton of content thus far. Like 10ish chars i think? I've only unlocked a few but there's a bunch of weapons and shit to unlock and runs have some variety @fl0m
[0:32:13] <jooosy_> is this hades FPS POGGIES
[0:32:16] <dankiyy> the execute perk is insane for late game
[0:32:27] <Puddin_Wing> maybe not a "ton"
[0:32:29] <LowRatedHighlander> looks very similar to this game but im sure theres differences
[0:32:31] <dankiyy> its so pretty now

[0:35:36] <GFYMeowMix> dweevers Puddin_Wing who have arsenal bought besides white? says they've spent the most thus far this window but idk on who
[0:35:37] <r_udra> YEP KEKPOIN
[0:35:46] <Puddin_Wing> You're so dumb I'm surprised literally having your atoms exist next to your other atoms doesn't kill you @fl0m
[0:35:52] <r_udra> no scopes
[0:35:53] <LucidR9> not even spelling your basic emotes correctly and he hopes to peepoBox me
[0:35:57] <Puddin_Wing> Odegaard, Ramsdale @GFYMeowMix
[0:35:58] <LucidR9> the fool
[0:35:59] <Puddin_Wing> lokonga
[0:36:05] <Puddin_Wing> And uh
[0:36:13] <LucidR9> just sign martinez
[0:36:13] <iVex> sick aim
[0:36:14] <LucidR9> ffs
[0:36:15] <jooosy_> stroke that dragon daddy fl0mGasm
[0:36:17] <GFYMeowMix> @Puddin_Wing i don't think those 2 are in the calculation since they're not done? could be wrong
[0:36:23] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing GFYMeowMix tavares to cover at LB
[0:36:29] <Puddin_Wing> that was the one i was missing
[0:36:33] <crocswsocks> SHEESH
[0:36:33] <GFYMeowMix> but would make sense since it doesn't seem like they've shelled out money for anybody else
[0:36:34] <Nightbot> crocswsocks has been bant BOP
[0:36:35] <LucidR9> offload auba offload laca and get martinez
[0:36:37] <LucidR9> do it
[0:36:42] <Puddin_Wing> lokonga and white and tavares are the only signings we've announced
[0:36:44] <LucidR9> get a young hungry striker
[0:36:54] <Puddin_Wing> but ode and ramsdale are apparently done
[0:37:03] <GFYMeowMix> getting lauturo would be legit
[0:37:03] <WTFoxhound> love this game
[0:37:03] <LucidR9> imagine dragon these nuts on your face
[0:37:15] <Puddin_Wing> all things considered, especially if we somehow offload a little dead wood, this hasn't been a bad window for us
[0:37:16] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing I don't mind Ode but 40 seems like a lot, but at least it's not the 60 real originally wanted
[0:37:22] <Puddin_Wing> the gunners subreddit is going full meltdown, but like
[0:37:25] <praeter15> gottem
[0:37:34] <praeter15> nice one loosekidarrnein
[0:37:39] <Puddin_Wing> we were never gonna be able to sell shit players that we have on huge wages during covid economy
[0:37:40] <GFYMeowMix> it's a rebuild phase
[0:37:50] <LucidR9> sports fl0m, grass
[0:37:52] <WTFoxhound> how far have you gotten?
[0:37:55] <dweevers> NODDERS Puddin_Wing
[0:37:55] <Puddin_Wing> and all the "everyone else spent 100m on one player and we spent it on a bunch of blah blah blah"
[0:37:56] <dankiyy> NODDERS
[0:38:00] <iVex> NODDERS
[0:38:00] <dankiyy> its op af
[0:38:01] <Puddin_Wing> like its a rebuild phase you fuckin wankstains
[0:38:03] <GFYMeowMix> people always gonna mald
[0:38:03] <crocswsocks> buy it
[0:38:05] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing we just need to sell half the midfield since we have 123423423 of them
[0:38:06] <dankiyy> actual aimbot
[0:38:13] <LucidR9> arsenal's been in rebuild for how many years now
[0:38:17] <LucidR9> smileW
[0:38:19] <Puddin_Wing> rumours we might still get rid of a few
[0:38:26] <iVex> ENHANCE
[0:38:28] <iVex> NODDERS
[0:38:31] <crocswsocks> ENHANCE
[0:38:38] <GFYMeowMix> we signed konate and a bunch of extensions and everyone thinks we're done for SHRUGGERS
[0:38:48] <GFYMeowMix> no big shiny grealish signing smhmh
[0:38:48] <LucidR9> you guys wayyyy overpaid for konate
[0:38:49] <praeter15> why he hold the weapon like that
[0:38:54] <Puddin_Wing> To be fair, we're signing a ton of young promising actual players right now. There's clearly a plan, whether or not arteta is here to see it through isn't really of consequence imo @LucidR9
[0:39:03] <GFYMeowMix> KEKPOINT like slabhead wasn't overpaid
[0:39:05] <LucidR9> mourinho to arsenal KEKPOINT
[0:39:17] <69potato69> just got here ist that shiiat a focking jujutsu ??
[0:39:29] <LucidR9> varane signing redeemed my sense of our ability to actually spend a reasonable amount on good players GFYMeowMix
[0:39:33] <GFYMeowMix> NODDERS
[0:39:35] <GFYMeowMix> varane legit
[0:39:37] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing that's the biggest plus of all these signings IMO. It's all young talent players who should be hungry
[0:39:40] <LucidR9> Idk how we got him for that price
[0:39:44] <F1niteCS> F1niteCS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! I've been on vaca for 2 out of the last 3 weeks, and started my new job in between those. So happy to relax and be back with the degens fl0mPOGGERS

[0:54:06] <Zeyzo_> NOPERS
[0:54:07] <2020numbers> no ?
[0:54:09] <LowRatedHighlander> monkaHmm
[0:54:10] <LucidR9> I dont think there's a 69 exception for peepoBox
[0:54:15] <theHovnival> okay. just checking
[0:54:22] <LucidR9> cause people would try to pick other numbers to mean special things
[0:54:22] <2020numbers> wym highest anyways hov
[0:54:23] <LowRatedHighlander> idk i feel like thats a reasonable exception.
[0:54:29] <fricks_lozf> theHovnival so 69 beats 100% but other than that it loses to every number higher
[0:54:32] <LowRatedHighlander> but idk
[0:54:35] <Zeyzo_> NOPERS no exception
[0:54:40] <LucidR9> what if 69% is a TKO
[0:54:41] <2020numbers> what?
[0:54:44] <LucidR9> even if it's round 1
[0:54:45] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah no exception seems better
[0:54:46] <2020numbers> monkaHmm
[0:54:48] <Zeyzo_> NOPERS
[0:54:53] <theHovnival> I was just asking. Seems like it's a straight higher number. No special number
[0:54:54] <fricks_lozf> chat as a peepoBox og 69% beats 96 and 100%
[0:55:00] <2020numbers> no exceptions NODDERS
[0:55:14] <LowRatedHighlander> 2020numbers thats your fav amount to bet isnt it KEKW
[0:55:18] <theHovnival> I'm cool with that. 69 is just for style.

[1:57:14] <Puddin_Wing> The pure poetry of asking JORIS to confirm a gamba is not rigged @LowRatedHighlander
[1:57:15] <fricks_lozf> 4% chance it was rigged
[1:57:19] <Puddin_Wing> surely you realize
[1:57:19] <fricks_lozf> peepoFoil

[1:57:34] <LowRatedHighlander> feeny Doccy changed the command early to always say 50
[1:57:39] <Sycocylin> Well chat time to die, I am super lactose intolerant, but I also have a massive bowl of Neapolitan ice cream, wish me luck
[1:57:42] <LowRatedHighlander> just making sure it doesnt say the same number twice
[1:57:42] <macbookfps> time to go to bed i guess KEKW
[1:57:51] <Puddin_Wing> I'm just sayin. Do you know the story behind that command and the name Joris or was that before your time? @LowRatedHighlander
[1:57:52] <praeter15> Sycocylin inject in the anus
[1:57:52] <LowRatedHighlander> so doccy has to have quick fingers if she really wants to rig it
[1:57:54] <LucidR9> you say that like it doesnt happen every year
[1:57:55] <macbookfps> ive lost every single gamba so far

[1:58:15] <Semiproshark7> make this a quick degen
[1:58:16] <jayess3> macbookfps take a break boss
[1:58:18] <Puddin_Wing> like the whole reason %? exists is because that's how they communicated while rigging gamba
[1:58:43] <scotlandsfinestmale> night night Mr Flom
[1:58:47] <LucidR9> feeny is the definition of "do not cite the ancient magic to me witch I was there when it was written"
[1:59:01] <Espurritos> Espurritos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[1:59:01] <Techno> - Espurritos just re-subscribed for 57 months! fl0mPog
[1:59:02] <Puddin_Wing> Lucid is the definition of "what the fuck is proper punctuation?"

[2:04:41] <Puddin_Wing> what's the book quote @XSNOW17
[2:04:48] <Puddin_Wing> I know in the movie it's what lucid said except "deep magic"

[2:07:58] <XSNOW17> I used to know The Horse and His Boy word for word
[2:08:10] <LucidR9> Mr Beaver was the absolute homie of all homies
[2:08:23] <XSNOW17> ^
[2:08:37] <LucidR9> man brought these random potentially dangerous humans into his home

[2:09:12] <LucidR9> change my mind
[2:09:17] <Puddin_Wing> just to throw another minor parallel out there, aslan was also treated as divine but was just the son of the actual big creator
[2:09:22] <F1niteCS> I was reading something how did this discussion come to be PauseFish
[2:09:26] <praeter15> F1niteCS just the wardrobe

[2:10:28] <XSNOW17> I tried reading LoTR and didn't like it
[2:10:35] <XSNOW17> it feels slow to me
[2:10:52] <LucidR9> it's slow cause of the sheer amount of shit that's happening
[2:11:01] <F1niteCS> LucidR9 you and my buddy would have a great relationship. He's read all of his works, including every bit of side notes he can get his hands on. He's a LoTR wizard, pun aside
[2:11:18] <LucidR9> if you read the silmarillion you'll understand the implications and background of everything that's happening in LoTR

[2:11:23] <Puddin_Wing> It is slow. It's also a fucking insane memorial to the sheer obsessive creative mind of Tolkien. The amount and breadth of lore he created for that world
[2:11:25] <Puddin_Wing> is fucking ludicrous
[2:11:28] <Mehlmann> same Sadge
[2:11:37] <praeter15> XSNOW17 it said like eleventy 7 in one of the first pages and as a 10 year old i was very confused and dropped it PepeLaugh
[2:11:44] <LucidR9> Silmarillion brings so much shit together
[2:11:50] <LucidR9> dont get me wrong, it's not an easy read

[2:13:19] <Puddin_Wing> All the different divisions and tiers of the ainur and their names and significance, all the divisions of the different species of humanoids and the ways their shit split up and came togethera
[2:13:29] <AchromiK> I was going to ask if you have any tips/advice for doing Poli Sci as a major since my GF is going into it soon fl0m
[2:13:31] <Puddin_Wing> all the wars and betrayals and fuckin gobshite

[2:15:56] <connorbh111> @AchromiK It can be very toxic in the discussions you have and the cliques that form, poli sci alone isnt enough to get anywhere so you need something else, but its very intriguing and fun to learn a lot about diff systems and international poli sci is very fun to learn as well
[2:15:58] <LucidR9> melkor was a bitch honestly
[2:15:59] <2020numbers> PauseFish
[2:16:02] <LucidR9> to be frank

[2:35:39] <sleeeeppyyyy> BOP yourducky
[2:35:45] <H3lte> Yeah still some early access thigns but its sticking to what the first one did well plus some good new things.
[2:35:50] <Puddin_Wing> The battles from room to room start getting more variety as you get up in the story a little, once you're on like 2 skull and above threat, you start gettin special rooms. Might check the ol help menu for an explanation of those @H3lte
[2:35:55] <Puddin_Wing> Yeah exactly what I thought
[2:36:02] <Puddin_Wing> They took what was good about the first one and made that better
[2:36:17] <LucidR9> "hey... dont I know you?  *just keep running before he stops you and asks about your multiple war crimes you've comitted"
[2:36:19] <H3lte> Im only 90 minutes in (since you metioned it earlier lol)
[2:36:49] <Puddin_Wing> well shit, i'm glad you're diggin it. Ziggurat got a little exposure from like Dodger and Jesse Cox I think back in the day, but I haven't really seen anyone talkin about ziggurat 2
[2:36:56] <Puddin_Wing> and that's a bummer because i think it's a much better game
[2:37:01] <frogoree> trying to bake for my gf but i cant do it Peepo
[2:37:01] <LucidR9> I also always thought that getting away only once for being the thane was a little rough, like in medieval times if you were a thane or whatever you'd get away with anything

[2:39:51] <zambam5> HYPERGAMBLE

[2:41:45] <hyprsld> chat is this a multiplayer game or single  player?
[2:41:50] <Puddin_Wing> either
[2:41:53] <Puddin_Wing> can be multiplayer
[2:41:56] <Puddin_Wing> can be played solo
[2:42:06] <LucidR9> I think one of the best video game designs of skyrim is giving you the perfect amount of false confidence on the way up to high hrothgar so that when you see the frost troll you think you can take it
[2:42:08] <sleeeeppyyyy> Semiproshark7 surprised from that 5k gamba KEKW
[2:42:14] <F1niteCS> Vampire hunters or something monkaHmm
[2:42:17] <hyprsld> seems like a fun game to play with friends
[2:42:28] <2020numbers> no max bet semi?
[2:42:29] <ChesterNugget> ay yo, fuck that troll.
[2:42:30] <Semiproshark7> im trying to make my points even now, im taking profit and not risking all my profit :)
[2:42:39] <Puddin_Wing> gettin thoroughly thundercunted by the first giant you meet is also a rite of passage in those games @LucidR9
[2:42:41] <2020numbers> Sadge
[2:42:42] <Puddin_Wing> like hey he aint that bad
[2:42:44] <Puddin_Wing> oh there goes my head
[2:43:03] <LucidR9> oh yeah cause the companions kill one basically for you when you're entering whiterun
[2:43:07] <LucidR9> and you think they're that easy always
[2:43:11] <fastz_af> is this game payed or free?
[2:43:19] <Semiproshark7> nah im done for tonight lol, small gamba
[2:43:25] <Puddin_Wing> i think the first time i met one was like right after i started building the house over the lake
[2:43:37] <Puddin_Wing> and i came outside and there was a giant standing there and lydia was like HEY WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IF I PISS THIS GUY OFF
[2:43:40] <Puddin_Wing> and i got twatted immediately
[2:43:46] <hyprsld> feeny you looking foward for the match against chelsea this week?
[2:43:49] <LucidR9> what about that one giant who's sad cause he lost his mammoth Sadge
[2:43:56] <H3lte> fastz_af its 10euro and early access
[2:44:04] <Puddin_Wing> you takin the piss or is that a genuine question @hyprsld
[2:44:05] <H3lte> also 12% off atm
[2:44:06] <fatalsavior> its like 10 bucks rn
[2:44:07] <DarkMattersCS> this game is worth every penny
[2:44:09] <N0t_Alyx> @fl0m Focus on grenade build out for this character
[2:44:10] <floatline> 10 usd for me
[2:44:13] <DarkMattersCS> its fucking great
[2:44:22] <fastz_af> then ima buy eheh of its 10euro
[2:44:25] <hyprsld> genuine question lmaoo
[2:44:26] <LucidR9> I was about to attack that giant and then I noticed he wasnt moving
[2:44:31] <hyprsld> because im not KEKW
[2:44:34] <sleeeeppyyyy> !1deag
[2:44:34] <Nightbot> sleeeeppyyyy pops a 1deag on yofou 1TAP

[2:44:41] <Resurrecte> monkaS
[2:44:55] <hyprsld> F1niteCS understandable pepeLaughing
[2:44:58] <Puddin_Wing> I can't remember the last game I was looking forward to. Especially not against any top sides. I'll look forward to games when we figure out how to play anything that resembles football again @hyprsld
[2:45:00] <Puddin_Wing> I'll keep watching
[2:45:03] <ar1ah> "oh shit" *sips alcohol*

[2:45:32] <H3lte> Did he even throw his big rocks?
[2:45:40] <LucidR9> there should be a quest that you can get that giant's mammoth from the soul cairn and he becomes an availible companion
[2:45:55] <Puddin_Wing> I wouldn't mind a mammoth companion
[2:45:56] <MrAwkwardTurtle> this game is sick
[2:45:58] <Puddin_Wing> i mean uthgerd is pretty close
[2:46:01] <Puddin_Wing> she's basically a mammoth
[2:46:05] <LucidR9> yikes
[2:46:12] <hyprsld> at this point im just watching out of habit tbh. but i hope it goes well this week and we dont get shafted too hard at least Puddin_Wing
[2:46:14] <LucidR9> I hate companions in most all games

[2:46:45] <Puddin_Wing> I just want to see progress. Anything that even loosely resembles progress. @hyprsld
[2:46:49] <LucidR9> in far cry 5 the only companions I was ok with having were cheeseburger and peaches
[2:46:53] <LucidR9> animal companions ftw
[2:47:03] <LucidR9> humans are annoying and have dialogue lines and just get in the way
[2:47:18] <Puddin_Wing> didn't play the first one, but I know people really liked it @aetherealphoenix
[2:47:26] <aetherealphoenix> im slightly intrigued by FC6 although it seems a bit silly
[2:47:33] <LucidR9> that's 90% of the point
[2:47:36] <LucidR9> of a far cry game
[2:47:40] <aetherealphoenix> @Puddin_Wing yeah it was a blast even though it came late into the zombie cycle
[2:47:51] <XSNOW17> the new R6 game is a let down
[2:47:57] <F1niteCS> @LucidR9 I mean Serana from skyrim was hella dope
[2:48:02] <LucidR9> eh
[2:48:08] <H3lte> monkaS
[2:48:11] <XSNOW17> I was expecting a crazy solo/co-op game not the BS they showed
[2:48:13] <floatline> ded
[2:48:14] <zambam5> getting rolled by some boulders PepeLaugh
[2:48:15] <LucidR9> too much sexual tension between serana and I that could never be realized
[2:48:20] <BrotherJon> peepoRunCry
[2:48:22] <LucidR9> without mods that is
[2:48:28] <aetherealphoenix> maybe my memory is fuzzy but i don't remember FC1 being like that @LucidR9 not saying its bad but it sure does hit different lol
[2:48:36] <F1niteCS> Lucid you mean your character.... right? KEKW
[2:48:41] <miaouuu3> It’s impossible
[2:48:43] <LucidR9> yeah... my character
[2:48:50] <MirrorMoirai> need to do more kz
[2:48:52] <floatline> monkaW
[2:48:54] <Puddin_Wing> I'm finally workin through some of my backlog of games. Alternating between seeing how much of Binding of Isaac Repentance I'm gonna complete and playin stuff I never got around to
[2:49:05] <MrAwkwardTurtle> will say this game is infinitely easier with another person or two
[2:49:07] <Puddin_Wing> I don't think I'm gonna 1000001% repentance, which feels fuckin weird
[2:49:19] <Puddin_Wing> because I perfect filed all 3 game files on that game before repentance came out

[2:49:44] <hyprsld> Puddin_Wing yes thats what most fans want i feel like. not expecting to be world class but at least competitive for now. not get thrown around the pitch by teams that got promoted for the first time in like 70 years Sadge

[2:51:10] <Doccy> okay
[2:51:12] <Doccy> degens
[2:51:14] <Puddin_Wing> Borderlands 2 is probably top 3 all time favourite games for me

[2:51:46] <XSNOW17> it took me 2 hours to beat because the QTEs suck
[2:51:47] <sleeeeppyyyy> fucking JruJru99 man
[2:51:47] <LowRatedHighlander> Doccy got it doe

[2:52:05] <LucidR9> I have the borderlands games, I should probably play them at some point
[2:52:07] <zambam5> are you playing sal from borderlands2
[2:52:10] <Puddin_Wing> I enjoyed 3. I have no interest in playing it to death like I did 2
[2:52:11] <LowRatedHighlander> too late meow SHRUGGERS
[2:52:13] <Puddin_Wing> but 3 was fun
[2:52:16] <Puddin_Wing> pre-sequel was okay
[2:52:25] <LucidR9> the bioshock games are good
[2:52:28] <Puddin_Wing> 2 is a fuckin glorious achievement of a game
[2:52:35] <XSNOW17> I own 2 and pre sequel but never played em
[2:52:39] <Doccy> stripSip
[2:52:45] <zambam5> 2 is great you should play it
[2:52:56] <zambam5> I'm waiting for a big sale to try 3
[2:52:58] <Killer_Panda2k11> I wanna max out my Zane before i do the DLCs for 3. Then i wanna jump back into 2
[2:53:03] <Puddin_Wing> I think I put like 500 hours into 2, which for a game with a story that isn't that long
[2:53:04] <XSNOW17> I also own the arkham games
[2:53:05] <LucidR9> bioshock twist is one of my favs in any game.
[2:53:10] <Puddin_Wing> like 2 is just such a fucking good game
[2:53:11] <LucidR9> and 2 was just a really good game
[2:53:25] <Puddin_Wing> My zero in 2 is so fucking kitted it's disgusting
[2:53:26] <zambam5> I don't think I finished that random new content they made for 2
[2:53:27] <Doccy> ngl chat
[2:53:28] <zambam5> I should get on that
[2:53:30] <sleeeeppyyyy> this gamba is haHAA
[2:53:32] <Doccy> i enjoyed bl3 more than i did 2
[2:53:37] <zambam5> heresy
[2:53:47] <Puddin_Wing> I thought 3 and its dlcs were good
[2:53:59] <Puddin_Wing> better than the presequel except for the claptrap dlc
[2:54:00] <Doccy> i just didn't find the characters and abilities as enjoyable
[2:54:03] <Puddin_Wing> 2 and the tiny tina dlc
[2:54:07] <Puddin_Wing> are fuckin masterpieces to me though
[2:54:14] <LucidR9> handsome jack is kinda handsome change my mind
[2:54:21] <MrAwkwardTurtle> i thought 3's gunplay was an improvement was story seemed sorta gimmicky
[2:54:35] <Puddin_Wing> I spent so goddamn long perfecting my zero. Infinity/Lyuda in every element, grog nozzle, the whole shebang
[2:54:40] <Doccy> now don't get me wrong bl2 is great. the characters are amazing
[2:54:51] <2020numbers> suck me JruJru99 i dont like you peepoAngy
[2:54:58] <Killer_Panda2k11> BL3 was great, but didn't change too much. They played it safe but its still amazing
[2:55:03] <MirrorMoirai> if you had taken deft hands perk, this big mg would be even more amazing with its inscription for extra projectiles
[2:55:08] <Doccy> but i enjoyed the gameplay and the game loop in bl3 more. the movement especially
[2:55:14] <Semiproshark7> 2020 u going full degen
[2:55:15] <Chezpuf> still not bloons? smh my head
[2:55:15] <MinwFPS> i just got recognized in a val dm, is this what it feels like to be famous fl0m POGGERS
[2:55:15] <Doccy> i am a slut for a good movement system
[2:55:18] <Killer_Panda2k11> BL2 was more enjoyable to me, mainly the story
[2:55:27] <Puddin_Wing> The movement in 3 was good, honestly I loved the movement in pre-sequel

[2:57:08] <sleeeeppyyyy> peepoCoffee
[2:57:11] <Puddin_Wing> but i agree there were some shortcomings with the 3 story
[2:57:22] <zambam5> Butt Stallion is the greatest video game character of all time
[2:57:23] <LucidR9> just cause games are good mindless fun
[2:57:28] <XSNOW17> eh idc about the overall story rn
[2:57:36] <XSNOW17> so spoilers mean nothing to me

[3:00:35] <Puddin_Wing> see that's lost on me. spongebob was after my time
[3:01:03] <LucidR9> Fred from scooby doo once said "this desert reminds me of a woman, it goes on and on and on"
[3:01:13] <kannar_tv> and then there was Ren and Stimpy...
[3:01:23] <Puddin_Wing> Ren and Stimpy fucked my shit up more than once

[3:12:39] <Doccy> https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyZanyDiscLitty-DvYZGBCp4Vu2DBe1
[3:12:59] <XSNOW17> clone wars is a fantastic show
[3:13:04] <XSNOW17> I need to watch it again
[3:13:07] <noaaahhh> i tried nightmare difficulty with a buddy and got fucking destroyed
