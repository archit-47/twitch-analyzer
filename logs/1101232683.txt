[1:30:56] <DanOBrien416> Smurfs exist and they'll never not exist. It's just variance whether or not they're on your team or against you.
[1:30:58] <m0FFFFF> @siiiif why the descremination
[1:31:00] <Lord_shny> @fl0m No, no, no. Appreciate YOU
[1:31:02] <polishslayerx> I do think it's a problem that people would rather derank to lower ranks just to have fun then play against cheaters in high ranks ya know
[1:31:08] <RustedTTV> @siiiif AYAYA
[1:31:08] <Timbot525> idk if its just NA but silver to gn is either people who are too good for the rank, or people who are new and or just dont care about a rank no inbetween
[1:31:17] <MagicMarker1> You're right there will always be smurfs
[1:31:28] <rastava98> @fl0m are you not twitch partnet yet

[1:31:49] <zThrice> what team was wilky on last season?
[1:31:50] <Pappy_Pud> there are always smurfs, but i think faceit handles them much better than mm. same with cheaters
[1:31:51] <DanOBrien416> If you're better than your rank, you'll climb by spamming games. Smurfs only expedite the games.
[1:31:52] <Chezpuf> @rastava98 he has the checkmark. that means partnered? I already said that?
[1:31:53] <GloryD> KEKW
[1:31:54] <polishslayerx> How many ppl are gonna chose to derank specifically out of faceit rank 8 to like rank 2 comapred to how many ppl in lem/supreme derank to mg on purpose(I have multiple buddies who did this cuz cheaters)
