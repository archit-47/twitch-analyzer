[3:47:51] <sloveCS> time to kill on a1-s is faster
[3:47:57] <lolypop98> FFA DM is so much better, way more action that i like
[3:47:59] <LowRatedHighlander> Np just had to wait a bit
[3:48:00] <LarryTheLurk> @sloveCS Only bodyshots tho
[3:48:05] <thedaringpastry> plus the m4a1s is longer ... makes hiding behind certain corners not work

[3:48:05] <Nightbot> fl0m's overview of the update is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09lAVpv-uH4
[3:48:07] <sloveCS> yeah
[3:48:08] <megaganj> does anyone know the actual numbers they changed?
[3:48:08] <angus799> NEED to hit the headshot but A1 is more accurate so you can
[3:48:13] <LarryTheLurk> Like if youre a headshot machine - m4a4. If not, then m4a1-ss is better
[3:48:17] <jockst3r> I agree the a1 is better now especially anti eco, 3 bullet kill
[3:48:18] <sloveCS> fl0m doesnt hit heads you know this
[3:48:25] <angus799> @LarryTheLurk other way round
[3:48:34] <PenguinofPower> With body shots, a1s is .30 seconds time to kill while a4 is .36

[3:48:50] <ImTarco> imagine headshotting
[3:48:52] <LowRatedHighlander> @umaroreis yes but we’re biased
[3:48:55] <thedaringpastry> the silencer on the M4A1S makes the gun so much longer too. O_O
[3:48:57] <lolypop98> 40 hs kills damn, hes so good
[3:49:01] <milkyrar> @umaroreis if you want to get profit, sure
[3:49:02] <NTesla12> check for blacksite first
[3:49:04] <Semiproshark7> watch blast big vs nip?
[3:49:11] <LarryTheLurk> @angus799 no? M4a1-s is 4 shot body, m4a4 is 5? But faster firerate, so if you dobbelt dink headshot its better to have a4
[3:49:12] <W0rstCase0ntarioBud> da frogmannn
[3:49:13] <CptFlicky> ive been trying to shoot down a drone for 3 hours

[4:00:57] <billballbowl> @fl0m , there is a strange man in your house
[4:00:57] <mrdicismv> fl0m someone is in ur office turnAroundChamp
[4:01:03] <thePillarist> has @fl0m addressed the "let's all go banana, get control, drop all our utility at car and let one guy throw 6 flashes/3 smokes/2 mollies/etc" fake yet? 😆 is there a limit to how many nades you can drop or...?
[4:01:05] <hot_leafjuice> I always use an Underscore before or after to ensure it's unique. Typically before. Most people dont do that @fl0m
[4:01:06] <bluehipp0> they dropped the Update 1-2 days before Diablo 2: Resurrected... ;)
[4:01:06] <2020numbers> sumaintright
[4:01:08] <j1t5s> But doesnt valve run the major? So they will use it
[4:01:09] <Lia_de> handyman spotted!

[4:01:10] <c0rkmcnortis> i feel like valve would want the major to be on the new patch, no?
[4:01:11] <feiginator15> yeah true, i guess they just didn't give us information related to that
[4:01:14] <gauravw30> @fl0m where can we usually find hostage in black site?
[4:01:16] <kooshyy> @fl0m when Is major

[4:32:49] <UtkarshJr7> @fl0m Did you made a steam group?
[4:32:50] <SupraUK_> it shows in twitch's chat

[4:32:56] <Techno> - turtleflippers just re-subscribed for 2 months! fl0mPog
[4:32:58] <justdanny> @fl0m look at the right of monkey276 sub and you can see the link to the tab
[4:33:03] <Gour204> its on the stream page, where you go and hit the sub button
[4:33:03] <justdanny> at least for the chat
[4:33:10] <bluehipp0> peepoRiot it's not too short! peepoRiot
[4:33:12] <dluxpoulsen> I dont see it, im on my phone
[4:33:13] <heisenburgblu> needs to be 12 rounds to win
[4:33:18] <DavieWhy> I personally think that this is so much better as a casual player
[4:33:21] <bluehipp0> I LOVE it! peepoRiot
[4:33:28] <silver_streakz> @fl0m i think the economy needs to change for the short comp
[4:33:29] <ItsJustHenry> Where are the accountant verified case openings xooxox
[4:33:29] <bluehipp0> but it might need some rebalancing in some cases, I think
[4:33:31] <a_341> !update
[4:33:32] <Nightbot> fl0m's overview of the update is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09lAVpv-uH4
[4:33:33] <Gour204> do you get the same ELO reward ?
[4:33:38] <bluehipp0> e.g. give more loss bonus for comebacks etc.
[4:33:43] <justdanny> was the money changed at all?
[4:33:53] <Gour204> its not that short consider we used to play 12 round halfs
[4:33:55] <billballbowl> I find that I'm getting more W's in the short mode when solo que
[4:33:56] <LowRatedHighlander> No eco changes
[4:33:59] <DavieWhy> I LOVE it! peepoRiot
[4:34:05] <bluehipp0> e.g. give more loss bonus, but top it out after 3 rounds instead of 4?
[4:34:10] <LowRatedHighlander> @v1zzxx they have that already
[4:34:12] <justdanny> i feel like you dont have any the opportunity in a mr16 to catch a financial break
[4:34:12] <LowRatedHighlander> They’ve had that
[4:34:13] <speciality_> Short comp is fun - economy is rough. If you change the double save, I could see MR12 since comp games last longer than they did 5 years ago
[4:34:15] <LowRatedHighlander> For like months
[4:34:16] <angus799> @bluehipp0 shouldnt need to if the eco is balanced well
[4:34:18] <ploucroux> yeah adding new modes but not 5v5 cas is pretty annoying
[4:34:21] <kr2ktrsms> will you win against bad news bears?
[4:34:22] <Tonespwns> whats the name of your dog?
[4:34:23] <MassiveToole> @fl0m its perfect for those "one more" games, since its a bit shorter
[4:34:29] <abhi007bond> !1deag fl0mB
[4:34:29] <perkyanator> you should joke with them an tell  them val is better
[4:34:30] <Nightbot> abhi007bond pops a 1deag on neu2k 1TAP
[4:34:33] <Gour204> you force up
[4:34:35] <philbinicus> %? 69
[4:34:35] <Nightbot> Joris says 64%
[4:34:37] <abhi007bond> %? 69
[4:34:38] <philbinicus> oof
[4:34:47] <abhi007bond> KEKWait
[4:34:48] <Gearslayer360> i feel like ct side could spiral fast tho @fl0m
[4:34:48] <Gour204> bring back 12 rounds and i'd be happy
[4:34:51] <LowRatedHighlander> @v1zzxx there’s a little thing at the top of comp queue that says ranked and unranked. Just check and uncheck it
[4:34:51] <andrewmedaTV> @perkyanator they know better. they watch his stream KEKW
[4:34:51] <sealer9> it would be cool if faceit added mr16 i thin
[4:34:52] <angus799> CS eco is good right now other than deagle being OP for 700
[4:34:53] <bluehipp0> that's the only issue I could see.. otherwise I like it to be short!
[4:34:55] <whitetail123> what’s the deag rework?
[4:35:03] <perkyanator> @andrewmedaTV hahahaha
[4:35:03] <LowRatedHighlander> It’s been there for a couple months
[4:35:07] <speciality_> I don’t like double saving on ct side
[4:35:16] <dluxpoulsen> @daviewhy agreed! @fl0m i have kids now, and would love to take a short game! I dont have 45-60 minutes anymore. Its a HUGE Update for a ‘young’ father like me. Its going to be much easier to just take 20-30 min game
[4:35:20] <LowRatedHighlander> also turn off all caps lol
[4:35:28] <angus799> @speciality_ you never need to double eco if you know what youre doing
[4:35:29] <perkyanator> CHAT does anyone know how the steam profile sign work?
[4:35:45] <LowRatedHighlander> @perkyanator get channel points and redeem it
[4:35:50] <SupraUK_> @perkyanator you get 750k channel points and then redeem it
[4:35:55] <sealer9> theres no such thing as saving in low level face it pugs :D
[4:35:57] <zerr0skill> @fl0m Can you drop nades at beginning of the round and keep buying them ?
[4:35:57] <splitsky_> what if you have to hold for a certain seconds to drop nades
[4:36:00] <NibletTide> @perkyanator yeah, use it and then eventually you'll get it; the mods are pretty good at making sure it happens
[4:36:02] <DeezPT> what time is the dreamhack match?
[4:36:04] <ChosenDew> @fl0m can you shuffle grenades like guns
[4:36:08] <sevinn> I just wish you couldn't fake flash
[4:36:10] <andrewmedaTV> @perkyanator once you redeem you post your steam profile link in chat and fl0m will sign
[4:36:16] <sevinn> and you can fake flash and throw a real flash immediately
[4:36:19] <angus799> @fl0m then you dont have a smoke and molo for arch so it doesnt make much of a difference
[4:36:19] <Spider22Monkey> Do you think the new collections for Dust 2, Vertigo and Mirage are going to replaced the current collection as the Major Suvenviors?
[4:36:22] <LowRatedHighlander> @v1zzxx chill with the all caps pls

[4:36:23] <nanerpus_> cant you smoke/molly most of banana from arch already?
[4:36:23] <bluehipp0> can you buy more than 2 smokes?
[4:36:27] <SwifferWetWiener> is that roasted chicken in your tea? wtf
[4:36:28] <Gour204> you can only buy 1 smoke
[4:36:30] <horser4dish> isn't there still the buy limit on nades
[4:36:32] <DavieWhy> @dluxpoulsen This is going to make CS so much more accessible and fun :)
[4:36:32] <sledu_u> You can only buy 1 smoke
[4:36:33] <splitsky_> or you can only drop one nade per round
[4:36:35] <clutchdame0> no you cant buy smoke once you have it
[4:36:37] <SupraUK_> @Spider22Monkey doubt it
[4:36:37] <speciality_> @angus799 there is, I mean it’s rare and only a thing if you lose the force buy on round 2
[4:36:39] <Cody1000k> cap at 5 per round

[4:36:57] <perkyanator> @perkyanator meant like do i put my id in or the link
[4:36:59] <Gour204> can only buy 1 smoke per round
[4:37:00] <sealer9> once yo buy a smoke u can't buy another
[4:37:02] <skyj_> LUL dropping nades is nice for the teams that have a bunch of people who don't know the lineups, they can drop smokes for the guy who knows them all
[4:37:02] <ambr0seTV> If you drop a smoke you can’t buy another
[4:37:03] <bluehipp0> ok
[4:37:03] <speciality_> @angus799 double saving on round 10 isn’t really a thing
[4:37:07] <Lemmiwinks7694> can't buy 2 smokes, HE, or molly
[4:37:10] <ekstral0ve> look at smooya's quoted tweet
[4:37:10] <unh0Iyy> It only allows you to buy 1 smoke per round.
[4:37:14] <Cody1000k> chat hes saynig if he uses his and goes back to  buy 1
[4:37:16] <siiiif> hey bluehipp0 peepoSit
[4:37:16] <Gour204> if you buy a full set, if you throw 1 u can pick up another
[4:37:24] <bluehipp0> Don't bogart that smoke, my friend. Pass it over to me!
[4:37:26] <Gour204> or buy another
[4:37:26] <Steelfire819> @cody1000k still doesn’t work that way
[4:37:27] <andrewmedaTV> @Cody1000k you can't do that

[4:37:42] <angus799> @speciality_ win pistol = 3000+, lose next = 1400, force that because you dont have loss bonus  then eco after
[4:37:45] <Dittek> Fl0m do you drop all nades when you die? Or one like it was before? Coz i see a situation where you drop all and just do agressive play...
[4:37:49] <originalpirate> peepoArrive
[4:37:51] <paapoWeird> What if you bring a smoke from the previous round?
[4:37:53] <LowRatedHighlander> @v1zzxx READ THE CHAT AND TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK
[4:37:54] <siiiif> originalpirate MLADY

[4:38:07] <theBaboda> i think so, that makes sense
[4:38:08] <andrewmedaTV> no the one that carries over counts as a bought smoke
[4:38:08] <Cody1000k> test is

[4:38:22] <dreamshadow0> @fl0m can u explain how big of a difference can be seen between 64 tick and 128 tick
[4:38:23] <SoporificPanda> i don't think you can do that
[4:38:24] <zerr0skill> Should make the nade disappear on the ground after like 15sec or something
[4:38:25] <originalpirate> doesn’t work that way

[4:38:28] <siiiif> LOWRATEDHIGHLANDER HOW I TURN OFF CAPS? Peepo
[4:38:29] <d4ynee> what about 5 smokes max per team per round
[4:38:30] <brusher_gg> can only carry one
[4:38:30] <angus799> if you pick up someone elses smoke you can drop it and buy your own
[4:38:33] <bluehipp0> what's the dividends on smokes?
[4:38:34] <sm0gless> i dont think so
[4:38:34] <SupraUK_> perkyanator can you post your steam profile here?

[4:41:16] <speciality_> @angus799 yeah but having deagles isn’t really a buy either. You should still lose the round. It plays into the cts saving aks they get rather than going for the round win

[4:53:52] <bluehipp0> it is
[4:53:56] <jokkerbo> yea
[4:53:56] <sevinn> that's the whole damn point

[4:53:59] <Nightbot> Fl0m's Steam Group https://steamcommunity.com/groups/fl0msstream
[4:54:04] <bluehipp0> but you can use it for just manipulating pitch in general
[4:54:09] <BH_Lithium> auto tune is stretching pitches to fit on a beat
[4:54:13] <boxxythegoat> its like drinking vodka vs beer
[4:54:15] <Steelfire819> Can you now run rush B and a single person flash 5 times over A?
[4:54:18] <ImTheOneAboveAll> Well yeah... Almost everyone nowadays uses autotune.   And autotune was introduced as just pitch-correction, but it has been exploited too much
[4:54:19] <baluma1998> auto tune is pitch correction correct
[4:54:22] <estevao_viana07> Hahah
[4:54:29] <estevao_viana07> Lov
[4:54:37] <bluehipp0> actually, I AM AUTOTUNE
[4:54:40] <The_Shuck> @keenofficialcs yeah I got the Arabesque AK MW w/statrak ($940 later)
[4:54:47] <ImTarco> It's the venn diagram thing. Autotune is pitch correction, but pitch correction isn't necessarily autotune.
[4:54:49] <V1ZzxX> @Steelfire819 thats literaaly it he is right there would be so many fakes damn
[4:54:55] <V1ZzxX> 10 flashes tbh
[4:54:57] <keenofficialcs> Correct auto tune is pitch correction to correctly correct the correctness of the correct sound on the correct beat

[4:57:29] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKW
[4:57:29] <hceqi> @fl0m  That was five head :D
[4:57:29] <NaV_Z> fake = sold
[4:57:31] <LittleYimYum> @fl0m are the nades droppable in comp? or is it other gamemodes
[4:57:32] <ImTarco> fl0m out here burning calories.
[4:57:32] <dreamshadow0> KEKW
[4:57:33] <ChosenDew> fl0m's sweaty ass
[4:57:34] <darkhippo4427> the delay between smokes is probably really obvious
[4:57:36] <LowRatedHighlander> Did it work???
[4:57:39] <LowRatedHighlander> Fuck
[4:57:39] <jUNGLE_420> @imtheoneaboveall that's cloud9 fake fake
[4:57:39] <TacticalAlmonds> Give enough time for them to bite on the fake?

[4:57:50] <mukulhayaran> KEKW
[4:57:51] <thedaringpastry> They need to make grenade dropping only during buy time, or are they going to leave it anywhere at any time lol
[4:57:52] <kaboom_09> pogg

[4:58:09] <mukulhayaran> @azimtoretto YEP
[4:58:15] <ChosenDew> your teammates pushed site so fast
[4:58:28] <thedaringpastry> so how much weaker is the deagle on body shots
[4:58:28] <jockst3r> would be better though if it was made with 2 people would make it less time between the smokes
[4:58:29] <angus799> when theres 3 smokes on A but you hear 4 people on B

[4:58:37] <Nightbot> Fl0m's Steam Group https://steamcommunity.com/groups/fl0msstream
[4:58:38] <macbookfps> the problem with throwing a 1man fake is the nade spacing would tip them off?
[4:58:52] <azimtoretto> so it must press "G" to drop it yeah?
[4:58:53] <ChosenDew> @macbookfps yeah needs to be a 2 man fake
[4:58:55] <dbz1h> new meta for a smokes always wait 10 seconds between smokes

[4:59:03] <dreamshadow0> @Nightbot this group to play private lobby?
[4:59:03] <Nightbot> No, Shut up.
[4:59:07] <Vaporware_Media> monkaW
[4:59:08] <darkhippo4427> intentionally delay a 5 man smoke to make it look like 1
[4:59:08] <boxxythegoat> @macbookfps gotta learn lineups from one spot sadge

[4:59:15] <bluehipp0> KEKPOINT
[4:59:15] <TacticalAlmonds> @macbookfps maybe at the pro level. This is faceIT or MM. nobody is throwing smokes at the same time anyways
[4:59:18] <Luigistarx> OOOO
[4:59:19] <LowRatedHighlander> @marajajr he doesn’t really do react stuff
[4:59:19] <mukulhayaran> Clap
[4:59:19] <macbookfps> boxxythegoat yeah that would help
[4:59:21] <daemonbreaker> OOOO
[4:59:22] <addicted1908> oop
[4:59:23] <V1ZzxX> deletion
[4:59:27] <thedaringpastry> @dbz1h that way on the 3rd smoke, the first is dissipated Kappa
[4:59:29] <macbookfps> @TacticalAlmonds tru tru
[4:59:30] <vent_diver> @macbookfps one way to counter that is to throw nades that land later first and progressively throw faster smokes etc
[4:59:32] <ekstral0ve> @darkhippo4427 @fl0m this is actual 5 head
[4:59:36] <jUNGLE_420> dgl nerfed? OK
[4:59:40] <ImTarco> Did anyone else watch the RedBull AoE tourney last week?
[4:59:40] <edgyeddy233> will they make the knife droppable?
[4:59:43] <V1ZzxX> do it for b fl0m ??? @fl0m
[4:59:49] <boxxythegoat> @edgyeddy233 imagine
[4:59:58] <boxxythegoat> you get that good skin buff
[4:59:59] <The_Shuck> @edgyeddy233 no
[5:00:01] <V1ZzxX> or 2 people would be more convincing?
[5:00:06] <boxxythegoat> we need grenade skins now
[5:00:13] <brownbabby> taco bell
[5:00:17] <V1ZzxX> @boxxythegoat kekw

[5:00:25] <jokkerbo> nice
[5:00:26] <V1ZzxX> @macbookfps yes
[5:00:29] <jokkerbo> that's huge
[5:00:33] <kn0p_> This match better end in 7 mins
[5:00:34] <darkhippo4427> a 2 person fake execute could make the smoke drop time alot tighter and more realistic
[5:00:46] <boxxythegoat> wait imagine like a flashbang sand dune the visibilty would be rlly bad actually
[5:00:47] <jUNGLE_420> make knifes throwable nokapp
