[1:38:50] <wy0s> amphibious gloves with any crimson web knife is nice
[1:38:53] <ScoutPack151> Talon is pretty nice, but this is coming from someone who can't afford knives so
[1:38:55] <MinwFPS> i still have my butterfly tiger tooth KEKW
[1:38:57] <Papa_Reesty> Pog

[1:39:10] <moosE3knucklE> Stew is calling and i like it.
[1:39:21] <STatisfacti0n> I used to have a huntsman TT and a butterfly TT but the karambit remains my favorite. Talon Knife seems kinda unnecessary with the existence of karambit
[1:39:36] <abhi007bond> D: ADHD
[1:39:40] <m00ki3> i got a skeleton fade i be fidget spinnin
[1:39:42] <dimesntreys> which one has the animation that you balance the tip on your palm
[1:39:50] <l3ordon> I think stiletto is an underrated knife
[1:39:52] <moosE3knucklE> i opened a Karambit Gamma Doppler fac new like 3 years ago in a case and i still have it
[1:39:53] <foorsitruc> is that TIBAW?
[1:39:56] <MinwFPS> m9 animation pullouts are nice Kreygasm
[1:39:59] <STatisfacti0n> just love spinning my knife KEKW
[1:39:59] <JavaFTC> Talon has a better take out animation than karam imo
[1:40:00] <jgrasp_> talon knife is a made in china karambit LULW
[1:40:02] <TyphloMusic> weird my twitch wasnt showing you live kinda wack
[1:40:07] <MinwFPS> pullout animations* FeelsDankMan
[1:40:12] <ChaoticRenny> @fl0m what about the skeleton the infinite spin
[1:40:16] <basedjumper> I love my M9 Bayonet
[1:40:16] <heisenburgblu> got my ruby sitl :)
[1:40:18] <Jazprr> SkinLords trying to boost the prices
[1:40:21] <l3ordon> I miss when you could buy a butterfly for like $200 Sadge
[1:40:23] <flopity_flop> @the_ganznoob Thank you, much love ❤
[1:40:25] <ScoutPack151> stilletto is just kinda boring. I like it though
[1:40:25] <azolaki> any nice galil skins?
[1:40:30] <thehazattack> I like the urus quite a bit also ngl
[1:40:33] <XeR0GaM3z> should i trade my huntsman knife autotronic for a fn graphite?
[1:40:37] <5Rule_> @azolaki cerberus
[1:40:38] <apoodle10> i really like the +8dps of the m9, but you can't really beat the +15% movement speed of the butterfly
[1:40:38] <JavaFTC> Remember when m4 assi was 40$ KEKW
[1:40:40] <TH0R_95> throw the ak and take the galul back Tarik
[1:40:43] <The_Ganznoob> It's not much but it's all I could do bud. flopity_flop peepoHug
[1:40:43] <Bolly> @azolaki Chatterbox
[1:40:44] <m00ki3> it needs more skins
[1:40:52] <m00ki3> ruby skeleton would slap
[1:40:53] <jgrasp_> I'll take the default ct knife over the flip knife no Kapp
[1:40:53] <l3ordon> You still have your skelly fade @fl0m ?
[1:40:55] <ChaoticRenny> I still like the survival knife the animation is so knife

[1:41:24] <moosE3knucklE> i also got that one knife that has the animation of u stabbing urself in the hand in a case. but i sold that thing cause i love my karambit
[1:41:24] <thehazattack> noone seems to use the classic either, never seen that in the major or other events
[1:41:28] <vRenzen> The KoC rises again
[1:41:31] <Joshewa_> The gut knife has a large enough blade and very unique shape which is why it’s the best

[1:42:13] <STatisfacti0n> and the classic knife is so cool
[1:42:14] <moosE3knucklE> the classic knife was super dissapointing... i wanted the old animations
[1:42:18] <l3ordon> I like the flip knife for awping, but besides that not a big fan
[1:42:19] <m00ki3> give the classic the bayonet animations and its 10/10
[1:42:23] <MinwFPS> cause if it had animations no one would buy other knives fl0m
[1:42:29] <thehazattack> can you link the main stream?

[1:45:33] <apoodle10> it'a a piece of art basically
[1:45:43] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m cool if I make a mainstream command and add it to the title?
[1:45:49] <razvycss> new mibr roster?
[1:45:54] <l3ordon> You should have both streams open, watch fl0m here and win stickers on the main
[1:46:01] <abhi007bond> 1TAP
[1:46:01] <jgrasp_> @fl0m You can't see that they took damage until a few seconds later
[1:46:03] <MinwFPS> he's saying that since its red on red its kinda hard to see monkaHmm

[2:59:05] <hayzay1> @fl0m what was that mode you were playing vs waves of bots?
[2:59:10] <The_Dictator_ING> I cant even run CSGO after the most recent update. Keeps crashing on map loads lol
[2:59:18] <toastisalie> !1tap
[2:59:22] <ScoutPack151> I just think this map feels too empty so I dont really like playing it
[2:59:25] <hunter6925> DonoWall
[2:59:29] <LuxionGames> Peepo ?
[2:59:39] <im2meta4u> which map do you think has better verticality (and harder for spectators) - vertigo or nuke?
[2:59:55] <abhi007bond> Peepo
[2:59:58] <markmaton> Can csgo make Italy a competitive map
[3:00:02] <supra_nightmare> @fl0m do we have a mod by any chance? nightbot & Joris died
[3:00:07] <CryptoMike22> seems like changes made dust2 way more CT sided, agree?
[3:00:26] <Rei_J4> Would it have been better if they made thedoors longer instead to deny vision?
[3:00:53] <sloveCS> ouch
[3:01:07] <ScoutPack151> ouch
[3:01:10] <c_killem797> cmooooon boltz. bring it home home so daddy can mute @retiiful fl0mB fl0mB fl0mHmm fl0mHmm fl0mHmm
[3:01:12] <fanachimo> go king plz
[3:01:26] <CryptoMike22> I don't think BIG have lost a map on Dust2 since the update, have they?
[3:01:39] <moosE3knucklE> i felt like most of the complaints about mid doors came from the community who DM'd on D2... cause i mean Deathmatch on Dust 2 was boring as fuck lol.
[3:01:39] <Dunklescrape> they already did that to b, not sure why they didn't try that first
[3:01:47] <vis9ns> monkaHmm flipping doors would block short no ?
[3:01:53] <maybeDuck> Nuke is just pain for mm
[3:02:06] <elcheer> uh oh
[3:02:10] <Dsharper> cobble best map
[3:02:14] <ChaoticRenny> I want train back
[3:02:19] <chinolinguino> i think viewing experience, its pretty good
[3:02:20] <SternXP> nuke is better than overpass now?
[3:02:27] <LilHammi> I hate nuke, but it's one of the few maps I play well on
[3:02:28] <c_killem797> Nuke is one of my favorite maps to watch.
[3:02:29] <Zeyzo_> YEP spud
[3:02:31] <Jazprr> A cobble re-work would be my dream
[3:02:31] <jadesfoxx> @fl0m is this game one for the series?
[3:02:31] <heisenburgblu> but mirage Kappa
[3:02:33] <priiide_> Speedrulez MLADY
[3:02:33] <TheBlankSkies> According to my faceit lobbies, Mirage is best

[5:16:26] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> bo7 Pog
[5:16:27] <Doccy> bo7 but it's split over two...
[5:16:27] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKWait
[5:16:28] <Doccy> FUCKER
[5:16:28] <noreaup> ???
[5:16:29] <Doccy> DAVEY
[5:16:30] <tequezzadoto> !maps
[5:16:31] <kristofgrozdan> LUL
[5:16:33] <Doccy> I WAS JUST TYPIGN THAT
[5:16:34] <tequezzadoto> !map
[5:16:35] <Doccy> CAN YOU NOT
[5:16:36] <1isac7> That sounds interesting ngl lol
[5:16:37] <LowRatedHighlander> thats a literal doccy joke
[5:16:39] <Tvjuli> Doccy He read your mind
[5:16:41] <Doccy> FUCKING STEAL MY IDEA
[5:16:50] <LowRatedHighlander> doccy says that as a meme all the time
[5:16:53] <tequezzadoto> 1st map guys?
[5:16:54] <LowRatedHighlander> davey just stole her idea
[5:16:57] <moosE3knucklE> Bo5 with the upper brack and lower brack and upper having a map advantage. making it like a b03 but with more
[5:16:57] <j_a_r_l> then day 2 is a waste of production for 1 game if it's a sweep
[5:16:59] <Doccy> fl0m can you tell davey he stinks
[5:17:03] <LowRatedHighlander> tequezzadoto look at the top left
[5:17:04] <vinciCS> tequezzadoto mirage, teamone won it
[5:17:07] <st4sisfield> if one team is up 3-0 after day one though you could end the final day in like an hour
[5:17:08] <UncleKenroy> KEKW
[5:17:19] <frogactual> Hello!
[5:17:26] <almostcooltho> Then they bring in team GTR KEKW
[5:17:47] <UncleKenroy> what's the chance of it getting to that
[5:17:53] <LowRatedHighlander> also what if you pay for tickets on the next day
[5:17:55] <jametime420> 7 MAPS KEKW nobody wants to watch nobody wants to play sounds good
[5:17:56] <LowRatedHighlander> but it ends before it
[5:17:58] <ScoutPack151> the overall level of play will just tank. I would never want to watch that
[5:18:12] <shmeby> imagine renting a hotel one extra day to come back to a 1 win go home
[5:18:20] <bolottekid> Yeah cs is missing that team fan home/away feel in sport
[5:18:22] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> plus the point of a map pool would blow @fl0m cuz theyd play their perma bans
[5:18:30] <peaq_tv> The games are too short to make that work
[5:18:37] <peaq_tv> a sports game is 2-4 hours
[5:19:07] <quuqua> bo7 is 2 day bo1
[5:19:29] <UncleKenroy> KEKW pull up for one match
[5:19:29] <Doccy> okay
[5:19:30] <Doccy> but
[5:19:32] <Doccy> bo7
[5:19:34] <sundarah> bo7 is the worst idea ive ever heard
[5:19:38] <Doccy> split over 7 days
[5:19:40] <Doccy> NODDERS
[5:19:43] <shmeby> it would not work for a commuter to games
[5:19:50] <2020numbers> doccy fl0mSmorting
[5:19:54] <Jagmister303> b07 over 2 days is a bad take
[5:19:56] <Indoorguitar> @fl0m BO20 over 3 hours
[5:19:57] <Rubrick25> o
[5:19:57] <st4sisfield> but they won't always end hype as fuck lol
[5:20:01] <bolottekid> 11-4 zonic law monkaW
[5:20:02] <m4lki3r> malbs not bringing it or being shut down?
[5:20:06] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> id fall asleep
[5:20:07] <MrFunkee_> also, b07 means we see the permabans, so we see dogshit cs?
[5:20:14] <iBUYPOWER> Peepo

[5:20:25] <CaeCzar> Peepo
[5:20:26] <elllli0t> it was like 28-25 on train
[5:20:27] <Kafkii> Peepo
[5:20:29] <quuqua> If there was even one OT in bo7 i'm deleting csgo
[5:20:30] <Doccy> bo30 but they only play one round each on a different map
[5:20:33] <Doccy> Peepo
[5:20:35] <tander159> Peepo
[5:20:36] <bolottekid> Peepo
[5:20:38] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> bo7 short matches @fl0m
[5:20:49] <vis9ns> Peepo
[5:20:52] <GodSpeed867> Boston was the best event i'd ever been to
[5:20:54] <KettamemeCS> Doccy, what about BO30 but all on the same map?
[5:20:59] <acey091> KEKW
[5:21:02] <FlameyKumori> Bo7 but they're all short matches
[5:21:03] <TerranDan> GLAWKED

[5:21:08] <almostcooltho> OOOO Swishy
[5:21:11] <Doccy> idk seems kinds controversial @KettamemeCS

[5:21:21] <2020numbers> %? 11-4
[5:21:25] <2020numbers> Madge
[5:21:36] <KettamemeCS> Joris says 40%
[5:21:40] <XeR0GaM3z> IBUYPOWER intern had me eating chocolate milk poweder
[5:21:40] <2020numbers> peepoW
[5:21:43] <XeR0GaM3z> unreal
[5:21:49] <m4lki3r> BO5 shows who has the deeper map pool.
[5:21:49] <UncleKenroy> the logistics alone with an extra day is rough
[5:22:10] <moosE3knucklE> i like the Bo5's but with one team having a 1 map advantage. u could get 4 maps which isnt as bad
[5:22:13] <gson98> The first matches would be quite boring though
[5:22:25] <vis9ns> any poklTalk's modCheck
[5:22:42] <vis9ns> peepoTalk

[5:22:54] <st4sisfield> fuck it, the finals is a week long and the player play a best of 3 every day.
[5:22:55] <zeroaim92> how did KoC do earlier?
[5:22:59] <dweevers> Sadge nightbot still borked
[5:23:06] <2020numbers> NODDERS dweevers peepoHuggers
[5:23:07] <ZedSnack> I don't think I would ever watch a match split over two days live, I would always wait til it was over and watch on vod
[5:23:09] <moosE3knucklE> b03 of b03's isnt actually a bad idea
[5:23:18] <Geyser56> %? Fl0m wears the same shirt every day
[5:23:21] <dweevers> peepoHuggers 2020numbers
[5:23:24] <tequezzadoto> 1:1?

[5:23:36] <zeroaim92> RIP

[5:24:15] <moosE3knucklE> lol
[5:24:27] <TheAuditorTV> Nah they dont need to refund just pull a F1

[5:25:41] <leepao> isnt junior furia player?
[5:25:49] <Doccy> okay but csgo marathon
[5:25:49] <dograt19> if this happens, every pro would be saying fuck davey for even thinking of this monstrosity
[5:25:57] <Doccy> every team has to play non-stop bo3s
[5:25:59] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> bo7 but each day is 1 map fl0m 5Head
[5:26:02] <moosE3knucklE> CS is a game of Momentum... splitting up a match would be so rough
[5:26:05] <marathon_fish> @fl0m i def prefer the bo3 of bo3s idea, that way i dont have to watch players on a map they havent played for 6 months and just getting stomped
[5:26:10] <keepherlitt> Bo3s are just the best way to go
[5:26:10] <Doccy> a team can drop out at any time
[5:26:16] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> completely original idea
[5:26:17] <Doccy> last team left wins
[5:26:18] <Indoorguitar> @fl0m hear me out, BO3 for the grand final but the losing team is executed
[5:26:21] <UncleKenroy> at this point just play on all the maps
[5:26:28] <Doccy> @LongRodVonHugeDonger laynaCrungoSpin
[5:26:38] <sloveCS> lmao
[5:26:39] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> borpaSpin @Doccy

[5:26:46] <quuqua> 7th map Mirage.... kill me
[5:26:46] <sloveCS> yeah know i wouldnt be the one to do it
[5:26:50] <vis9ns> Prayge slove tries it anyway
[5:26:51] <Nomad182> davey is fucking dedicated to the cause, but that ain't for me
[5:26:57] <dograt19> b07 but davey has to solo cast it with no chat
[5:26:57] <Dsharper> BO7 all maps go to OT Kappa
[5:26:59] <bolottekid> KEKW
[5:27:01] <ZedSnack> doesnt want to watch arena cs, but wants a major final to be a best of 7 LUL
[5:27:20] <Gekko125> BEST OF 8 LAST MAP COBBLE
[5:27:25] <keepherlitt> @dsharper I would jump off a cliff
[5:27:25] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> fl0m stop talking Davey went to a major and you never have so hes more valid NODDERS
[5:27:36] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> played*
[5:27:43] <ScoutPack151> why would you ever want to watch a match that isnt at the top of the players levels?
[5:27:47] <vis9ns> BOOMER
[5:27:47] <quuqua> ok ok, i could watch bo7 if last map is canals
[5:27:52] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> borpaBased

[5:29:17] <LongRodVonHugeDonger> why dont we have a major on Danger Zone @fl0m where they play 11 DZ games
[5:29:24] <c_killem797> shake deserves so much more of a team than where he's at. I WILL DOE ON THAT HILL
[5:29:24] <dorfenklus> it feels a little underwhelming otherwise
[5:29:36] <Doccy> is basalt one of the maps added with the operation
[5:29:40] <Dsharper> BO7 but map 7 is always office
[5:29:42] <Doccy> make last map Basalt
