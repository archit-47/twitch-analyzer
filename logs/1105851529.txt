[2:18:30] <siiiif> Mirage is the Global Offensive version of the Counter-Strike community map de_cpl_strike, created by Michael "BubkeZ" Hull. Hull originally created de_cpl_strike for the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL). Hull later created a non-CPL version of the map and named it Mirage (de_mirage).[1] It was a popular community map in the Counter-Strike community for years, and a version of the map was even made for Counter-Strike: Source.

[4:47:35] <macbookfps> while NIL is nice for college players to earn a wage, it def sways the best players to go to only the big name schools cause it's a brand
[4:47:39] <LowRatedHighlander> macbookfps and he hasnt played a single year of college football?
[4:47:43] <macbookfps> NOPERS
[4:47:47] <vis9ns> NOPERS

When your not online I'm watching the vods, when I run out of Vod's to watch I reenact my faviorite moments with family memebers at home. My mom loves to be a mod. She does so good at it. Either way. Your stream has given me new life and I can't thank you enough. You've finally earned my follow.

[8:25:00] <LowRatedHighlander> !dying
[8:25:00] <Nightbot> Counter Strike Is dying because I can’t get a decent fucking game for the life of me. Ranks are broken everywhere and I’m getting at least one griefer on my team every other game. Matchmaking so unbalanced and I’m including dogshit FACEIT. Really is quite sad how I can’t get decent games
[8:25:03] <LucidR9> !sumerians
[8:25:03] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree
[8:25:05] <LowRatedHighlander> !howsitgoing
[8:25:05] <Nightbot> Clearly not very well or else you would’ve known that my faceit experience has been the worst lately. Heavily unbalanced lobbies, teammates griefing me, teammates with no mics, teammates going afk. So many issues. It’s very rare I get a decent game that isn’t one sided
