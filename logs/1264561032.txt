[2:09:26] <fhilcollins> I get my political and medical information from the same youtuber that recommends me crypto /s
[2:09:31] <apoodle_> mainstream media is way too close to the industry, i'd rather get my news from some random person, that nobody fact-checks, who has a massive financial incentive to be friendly with advertisers
