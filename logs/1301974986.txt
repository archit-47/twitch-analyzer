[1:00:20] <BSODslayer> Astralis' state of affairs right now is so f#%ked that I can't make up my mind whether I want  Navi to win and make things easier for us, or Ence to pull off the comeback and have Navi kick the snot out of them - the longer they manage to "just get along", the longer it'll be before they get their shit together and fix things PROPERLY... PeepoThink
[1:00:21] <dtrmined> play valo if you want that

[6:46:03] <hemo_tox> why peek? didn't tap? Definitely some inexperience showing
[6:46:04] <birdplaneufo> THIS NOT NORMALLY. CHECK HLTEVEE
[6:46:05] <alpinestartgate> device would've died 5 minutes earlier Kappa
