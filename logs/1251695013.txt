[1:08:21] <FlameyKumori> Gaming laptops have a place, but you gotta have a real good reason to get one.
[1:08:37] <hubz08> which isnt gaming
[1:08:38] <FlameyKumori> Travel a lot? Go for it, but stay home all the time? Desktop
[1:08:41] <sjoerdtheman> you should pretty much never buy high end gaming laptops unless you travel a lot
[1:08:46] <macbookfps> i use a gaming laptop for my research and doubles as my gaming computer KEKW
[1:08:48] <Ashas1991> of course PCs will end up being better for a certain price
[1:09:06] <frogoree> gaming laptop was only good for me when i was in a dorm in college. other than that pretty bad
[1:09:21] <bolottekid> @fl0m don't forget they insta veto to d2 YEP
[1:09:21] <macbookfps> once i graduate + get a job im getting a desktop
[1:09:32] <the_kung> gaming laptops are good room heaters
[1:09:33] <RookieFoxx> it is

[1:09:53] <irresponsibletendencies> @fl0m but people frown when you bring your desktop to class.
[1:09:57] <tan_clips> im sure the current gpu market is pushing ppl to laptops
[1:10:01] <frogoree> yeah, my problem was i needed a laptop AND a gaming rig so i got one for both. got a desktop when i moved into an apartment for last two years tho
[1:10:06] <NERVg> In normal times yes but the GPU market is so fucked for desktops
[1:10:06] <Necrovane> the thing i hate about laptops is im  too goddamn tall to be comfortable while using one
[1:10:09] <whatchu_kno> fl0m you look like jon daily with your pic
[1:10:11] <ShatterinGlass1> my friend found a really good gaming laptop for 1500$ and it runs csgo well what else do you need
[1:10:15] <NERVg> Prebuild prices are starting to come down tho
[1:10:16] <SternXP> or buy a portable desktop and buy 2 monitors to move around
[1:10:23] <ShatterinGlass1> it's definitely better than my 1500$ dell
[1:10:23] <sjoerdtheman> thats true, but if you want to game on the laptop a higher end gaming laptop would do better
[1:10:23] <tub_gurl> I've only had gaming laptops for the past 8 years or so. The portability is deff nice.

[1:36:00] <crustydumper_> fl0m, how is it possible that when I play with lvl  9s and 10s, I never see anyone knowing flashes. Sure people know some smokes, but people just don't throw flashes and I'm the one ending up throwing flashes and even sometimes entry after I throw my flashes. It really is the most frustrating part about solo queueing.

[1:50:52] <bartow> Hi Fl0m
[1:50:53] <sleeeeppyyyy> imagine going for double right instead of a double left and right
[1:50:53] <The_Dictator_ING> WOULD IT NOT BE GOOD TO AD A FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN SELECT WHICH MAP YOUE SPECIFICALLY WANT? SO get matched with others who want that too?
[1:50:55] <ItsAho> Faceit making it to where you can que only 1 map has really ruined their mm system.
[1:50:57] <Arrivall> And a better elo system that doesn't have rank decay LUL

[2:05:05] <praeter15> As a brazillian fan this is so disgraceful, regardless if the print is legit or not, its pitiful how petty players can be. Like really? 00nation with KNG was being trashed by tier 3 EU teams and cold new project doesnt even seen that good on paper. People really arguing who is the least worse brazillian team when they should strive to be the best team in the world? Pathetic.

[2:08:03] <whatchu_kno> nitro is basically confirmed
[2:08:07] <richiehedd> @bono_cs nitr0 was so bad before he was let go.  what makes you think he's gonna be good?

[2:08:28] <bono_cs> nitr0 was never main awp
[2:08:33] <whatchu_kno> nitro was never bad and he left on his own wym @richiehedd
[2:08:36] <richiehedd> he's saying liquid need an igl but shox is an igl

[2:12:41] <NewellOK> @whatchu_kno if stew was a better player than osee, why would liquid cut stewie and sign osee, hes a good IGL but osee is a better awper
