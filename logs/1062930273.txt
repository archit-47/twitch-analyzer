[0:43:22] <bwoken> i only play faceit when i hate myself
[0:43:23] <Wint7r> yup hi !, how are you today ?
[0:43:26] <MenaceAKA> @Mikkel1591 cs is a great game :^)
[0:43:30] <Mikkel1591> :)
[0:43:36] <bwoken> and i have 5k games Sadge
[0:43:39] <whoinvitedjez> @MenaceAKA i just need to show them a negative covid test at the border
[0:43:48] <whoinvitedjez> but taking a covid test isnt a fun experience
[0:43:56] <Mikkel1591> i played for the first time in over 2 weeks meance
[0:44:00] <MenaceAKA> @whoinvitedjez does it have to be the PCR-T test or can it be the fast test?
[0:44:09] <MenaceAKA> with DS right @Mikkel1591 ?
[0:44:14] <whoinvitedjez> @MenaceAKA PCR sadly
[0:44:16] <Mikkel1591> yeah
[0:44:16] <Hevar> ive still never taken a covid test
[0:44:28] <whoinvitedjez> me neither but i gagged when i heard about it
[0:44:33] <whoinvitedjez> and thats enough for me to want to avoid taking it
[0:44:34] <MenaceAKA> its not that bad
[0:44:41] <Hevar> hf getting ur brain poked at
[0:44:49] <Mikkel1591> hevar you are from the hood
[0:44:54] <Huskieee> @Hevar what brain
[0:44:55] <whoinvitedjez> yes they are hella expensive
[0:45:04] <MenaceAKA> i paid like half of that damn
[0:45:06] <Mikkel1591> we pay 0 kroner :)
[0:45:08] <Hevar> yeah the tests here are nearly lethal Mikkel1591
[0:45:13] <fede4herrera> hii
[0:45:20] <Hevar> they just shove it up ur nose
[0:45:22] <Hevar> if u die u die
[0:45:23] <Vishtiga> have you not got vaccine yet?
[0:45:25] <fede4herrera> todo bem?
[0:45:30] <MenaceAKA> in portugal you can generally get it for free if you think you have it
[0:45:44] <bwoken> what is this game
[0:45:44] <whoinvitedjez> same here
[0:45:46] <Mikkel1591> we can get testede as much as we want for free
[0:45:47] <Archit47> nessa rat plays PepeLaugh
[0:45:49] <notghostlad7> a girl streamer that actually plays csgo and doesn't do "asmr"? impossible
[0:45:54] <whoinvitedjez> "i have a sore throat"
[0:46:03] <whoinvitedjez> the thing is, ive had it
[0:46:05] <Vishtiga> NA molly
[0:46:07] <MenaceAKA> yep pretty much @whoinvitedjez
[0:46:08] <whoinvitedjez> so it will show antibodies
[0:46:15] <whoinvitedjez> and i will test positive for it
[0:46:19] <whoinvitedjez> unless my antibodies are dead
[0:46:23] <notghostlad7> a girl streamer that actually plays csgo and doesn't do "asmr"? impossible
[0:46:35] <Vishtiga> antibodies only stay for 3 months apparently? people in UK are getting covid after having vaccine
[0:46:36] <Mikkel1591> we do you repost that comment
[0:46:38] <MenaceAKA> but you could also just say that you were in close proximity of someone who contracted covid and you can get the test for free
[0:46:47] <bwoken> a girl streamer that actually plays csgo and doesn't do "asmr"? impossible
[0:46:48] <Vishtiga> but it is not very serious if you have had vaccine
[0:46:50] <Mikkel1591> we just order at test
[0:46:53] <AdamUK> morning
[0:46:54] <Hevar> i mean it does make sense that its expensive since the government really doesnt want people to travel
[0:46:57] <MenaceAKA> omg hi adam
[0:47:00] <Hevar> so they just slap a massive fee
[0:47:01] <Hevar> on a test
[0:47:05] <Mikkel1591> doesnt matter if you feel anything or been close to anyone
[0:47:14] <whoinvitedjez> what government KEKW
