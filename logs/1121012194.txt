[1:30:30] <Puddin_Wing> german shepherds are the fuckin sweetest sweeties
[1:30:43] <PewPew_Mac> @jayess3 RIP points
[1:30:45] <ScholarSignus> you have that with any dog
[1:30:46] <Gatherbro> Had a daschund when I was a kid, loved that dog. Had a few rescues, its always a dice roll on their behavior. Some were great and others were just abused too badly. Try to look out for Amish puppy mills if you go for a puppy.
[1:30:51] <sjoerdtheman> one of those ate my cat feeny
[1:30:57] <TheOGBlink> Man now that i think about it times changed. It went from "MOM GRAB THE CAMERA" to a basic "Clip it!" bring back the old days KEKW
[1:30:59] <bluehipp0> it was sweet, but if they gave a certain command, it would be also... not so sweet PepeSerious
[1:31:00] <Puddin_Wing> your cat was probably a cunt then
[1:31:02] <Puddin_Wing> I mean
[1:31:07] <br0ther_> dachshund puppys basicly fit in ur pocket they are adorable
[1:31:09] <Puddin_Wing> sorry to hear that?
[1:31:13] <LowRatedHighlander> Feeny too far!!
[1:31:15] <roman_anderson> so are the dog version of german shepards
[1:31:16] <RAMLR> german shepherds are the best
[1:31:16] <sjoerdtheman> feeny youre a cunt
[1:31:19] <Justhoohaa> if I didn't have kids I would rescue dogs.
[1:31:28] <zoofuu_> Australian shepherds are amazing too
[1:31:31] <s0rted> I work with a dach/yorkie puppy and he's a smart little guy
[1:31:31] <Puddin_Wing> but at least I'm not a caat

[2:28:32] <Justhoohaa> I don't think they have the same success
[2:28:43] <dankiyy> he was top 20 himself

[2:31:43] <EoinMon> @fl0m do belfast giants have any clout in the ice hockey world. friend asking me to head to a game
[2:31:47] <Justhoohaa> I get what you're saying. but also I don't see lucky and bubski being top 20 in a year. I just think the caliber of player he had is so much lower now. Im not saying glaive isn't great. I just don't believe in the project
[2:31:50] <sol1taire> were you excited that raiders moved to LV?
[2:31:56] <tn15_> so Brady did deflate the footballs is what youre saying?
[2:32:24] <LowRatedHighlander> Coaches set the stage for the QB and one can easily screw up the others game plan
[2:32:29] <dsmokeeeee> bubski just needs time to adapt to a new thing in his life i think he will be good player nor the best
[2:32:51] <dweevers> LowRatedHighlander they also can take it out of the QBs hands when they're just not good enough like the Ravens did with Dilfer

[2:36:57] <ShrapTy> i accidentally picked my nose on a Go-To-Meeting this morning, so hows everyone else doing?
[2:36:57] <Justhoohaa> yea. I just thought we were asking if astralis was going to be good. and I think it's just going to take a while. that's all I'm saying.
[2:36:58] <Killer_Panda2k11> @amutantcookie i think he signed another contract
[2:37:04] <sevinn> they lost one of the best clutch players in the game
[2:37:07] <LowRatedHighlander> Or leaks not rumors
[2:37:15] <sol1taire> @stormshitman i believe astralis already played TS and beat them. with mir and degster and all the bells & whistles
[2:37:25] <hobrev> and once it settles for now then Xyp9x might be changing teams, he will be super hard to replace
[2:37:30] <dnillo> the last couple of days ive been clutching hard
[2:37:32] <amutantcookie> Why do I feel like I just saw an insta story about him exploring options. MAybe I was drunk and read it wrong
