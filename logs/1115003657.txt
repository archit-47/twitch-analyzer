[2:05:29] <wastemanOCE> @gunnerman343 ?

[2:05:36] <LowRatedHighlander> That’s a new take
[2:05:45] <yump0d> @gunnerman343 why
[2:05:52] <SuperTuscan888> make it 150 instead of 100? monkaHmm
[2:05:53] <TheSlayyer> Valorant armor KEKW
[2:05:54] <rony9> peepoAngy
[2:05:54] <siiiif> make it like Valorant! fl0mSlam also add riot shield
[2:05:55] <Marcel159> @sevinn Im pretty sure you can have the overlay
[2:05:58] <Thercules> Its because it needs to be like valorant OMEGALUL
[2:06:09] <rony9> peepoHug
[2:06:13] <1downbad> hltv forums havent even seen that take yet
[2:06:13] <SoporificPanda> make it like armor in halo
[2:06:14] <goldenlogic23> Was that nori in the background? KEKW
[2:06:16] <yump0d> valorant players are something else
[2:06:25] <siiiif> SoporificPanda perfect for baiting teammates OMEGALUL
[2:06:26] <gunnerman343> wellwell everytime i got shot i have like 30 hp and 90 armor
[2:06:28] <dir7ycs> mornin fl0m
[2:06:33] <LowRatedHighlander> Alright calm down he hasn’t said anything about Valorant chat
[2:06:43] <yump0d> @gunnerman343 so why do they have to redo it?
[2:06:45] <TheSlayyer> make the armor recharge like a shield
[2:06:45] <agarlicbear> just because you dont get how it works doesnt mean it doesnt work the way its supposed to
[2:06:53] <siiiif> LowRatedHighlander yeah but he could say something at any minute Peeposit
[2:06:53] <MaxofMine> @gunnerman343 it’s because of the armor penetration stat on guns
[2:06:55] <yump0d> maybe look up how it works
[2:06:58] <Uwotm08> Armor nerfs SMGs.
[2:06:59] <Ampholyt> armor absorbs 50% of incoming damage

[2:07:17] <m0peo> fl0m i cant find my JUUL and now I am here
[2:07:19] <Uwotm08> @Ampholyt That depends on the gun's armor penetration value.

[4:14:25] <bolottekid> madTYPER
[4:14:26] <GFYMeowMix> pretty sure that my first explicit CD as a youngin
[4:14:30] <GFYMeowMix> was*
[4:14:33] <heenan_09> change gamba to win ? 26 rounds done
[4:14:49] <Puddin_Wing> sun god was the end goal in the flash game, idk about this fancy standalone @LucidR9
[4:14:54] <LowRatedHighlander> I think the first cd I owned that was explicit was toxicity
[4:14:55] <Mojoner> If you want to summerize how messed up the early 2000's in one sentence; Slipknot nearly fist-fought Limp Bizkit on numerous occasions and their feud was headlining several newspapers.
[4:15:01] <little_manga_reader> if the gamba is 26+ wouldn't it be yes at 11-11?
[4:15:04] <Puddin_Wing> hi mojo
[4:15:05] <GFYMeowMix> solid CD LowRatedHighlander

[4:15:24] <Mojoner> Toxicity was such a good album
[4:15:25] <heenan_09> 10-10 cause ever team needs 6 more to win
[4:15:28] <Mojoner> SOAD in general had some great albums
[4:15:31] <LowRatedHighlander> toxicity was so good I love it so much
[4:15:34] <LowRatedHighlander> For sure
[4:15:34] <MrRenyu> yup, at 11 11 we win gamba
[4:15:36] <boxxythegoat> i fucking LOVE soad
[4:15:45] <GFYMeowMix> @MrRenyu it's already won
[4:15:51] <GFYMeowMix> 16+10=26
[4:15:54] <Puddin_Wing> I don't own many soad albums, but Toxicity is fucking tops
[4:15:58] <n0r13k> This map is really good isn't it? If they added a little more cover to plant on A site it'd be one of the best maps in the game.
[4:15:59] <boxxythegoat> SOAD, Tool, Rage against...

[4:47:11] <SuperTuscan888> welcome to the nova club
[4:47:14] <cassieblacc> anyone know why my jumpthrow bind wont keep when i restart cs but clear decals will?
[4:47:27] <LowRatedHighlander> That’s a weird one
[4:47:36] <amutantcookie> is it in the cfg file?
[4:47:53] <cassieblacc> nah just put in console. they both are
[4:47:54] <Luigistarx> @cassieblacc did u add ur autoexec to startup commands?
[4:47:55] <chickenuggetz2> You    can't buy anything now.
[4:47:57] <amutantcookie> might need to resave the file and do the process again. mine used to do that
[4:48:06] <LowRatedHighlander> Yeah you have to have it in there so basically it commands it every time you boot up cs
[4:48:15] <LowRatedHighlander> Right?
[4:48:18] <Luigistarx> yeah
[4:48:31] <amutantcookie> I think that's right LowRatedHighlander
[4:48:33] <cassieblacc> agh ive been putting off creating a seperate cfg because i dont know how lol
[4:48:36] <LowRatedHighlander> It’s been a min since I’ve messed with that
[4:48:36] <tangoa> For anything I want to persist, it’s in the cfg
[4:48:46] <nigentaum> !mald
[4:48:46] <Nightbot> hitboy?
[4:48:51] <MrFortyOz> i just use the config generator workshop map and that saves it for me
[4:48:53] <LowRatedHighlander> @cassieblacc it’s not hard there’s plenty of YouTube videos on how
[4:48:57] <Luigistarx> u have to make an autoexec and add +exec autoexec.cfg to launch options
[4:49:02] <amutantcookie> or can you launch the auto exec again in console and it refresh it?
[4:49:10] <cassieblacc> @LowRatedHighlander you underestimate my laziness
