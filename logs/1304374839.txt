[1:06:52] <klapperton> @fl0m do you think faze will get an academy team
[1:06:53] <Call_Me_Moldzyn> NA being EU's academy Keepo
[1:06:56] <RFPaji> 100thieves should go that way
[1:06:57] <BenjaminFlockuh> is it lack of academy talent in NA or lack of infrastructure?
[1:07:01] <Sem073> Could Liquid build an Acedemy team and house them in Utrecjt
[1:07:06] <bluehipp0> I'm waiting for an FC Bayern München CSGO team KEKW
[1:07:06] <Bolly> @BenjaminFlockuh yes

[1:09:39] <hobrev> yes
[1:09:39] <FrostedxFlames> Theres a few good NA servers I still play sometimes
[1:09:47] <hobrev> 1.6 has a very healthy public scene still
[1:09:49] <mcnellis253> why is na cs so rough ?
[1:09:52] <mamluku> csgo is older than 30% of us here @fl0m
[1:09:52] <kracakelele> bro once u get into csgo its so hard to quit
[1:09:53] <TestTubeBaba> 1.6 is massive in the Balkan region still
[1:09:54] <Ficii> And that's on steam, majority play without it from what I've seen

[1:47:20] <Bact_val> LMFAO actuALLY TRUE
[1:47:20] <lategamer3> ppl surrender way more in valo than cs
[1:47:21] <mukulhayaran> CSGO players think their game is sooo hard, mf you've had 20 years to learn how to use 4 pieces of utility and 3 viable weapons 💀In Valorant we have 87 different utility, ults, no set weapon sprays to memorize, deliberate changes to the meta, etc etc. We are not the same 🤣
[1:47:22] <hobrev> it is actually EU MM tho
[1:47:22] <Bolly> in my 10 games of Val I've had 2 where people wanted to surrender at 3-0 KEKW
[1:47:24] <alpinestartgate> in cs people just turn on rage cheats after a 4 round lose streak KEKW
[1:47:24] <mcnellis253> FUCKFLOM val best
[1:47:25] <Snake2250> Can you even ff in CS outside of 4v5s?

[2:39:38] <alan_karmaaa> Someone else needs to step up
[2:39:39] <yay2relax> @fl0m did u make predictions pre major?
[2:39:41] <MagikAhrim> nip needs more consistent rifles to do anything
[2:39:41] <Dynamo_Dave> @eclipse42 oh no. what did I do?
[2:39:45] <mamluku> @fl0m ure watching faze v navi next right?
[2:39:46] <elfengradient> NIP needs more aggressive and firepower players
[2:39:46] <ribzy1> shox nip?????
[2:39:47] <blussed> yeah every game
[2:39:48] <aryansamaa> plopsky should go for sure
[2:39:50] <cosmic_sasquatch> nip could get brollan and krimz maybe?
[2:39:52] <gamer9627> rez didnt show up on T side at all
[2:39:55] <dtrmined> navi v faze time?
[2:39:58] <BSODslayer> I can't get over the hump either. That was six years ago, she still hasn't me called back. Rough.
[2:39:58] <SenpaiKayKayy> rez and plopski need to step it up tbh
[2:40:00] <rallebabzen> But who tho
[2:40:02] <moofookkaa> they blame phzy

[2:40:11] <jeevesses> Heroic will win Antwerp
[2:40:13] <ayham0834> Rez should go
[2:40:13] <k1ngmacher> rez is too inconsistent
[2:40:13] <seren1ty1337> I'd go the phzy route
