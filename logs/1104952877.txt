[0:37:53] <Uwotm08> @WookiePotamus I'll donate $10 to your GoFundMe for heading to fl0m's Silver LAN.
[0:37:53] <Wyngless> I'm terrified of breaking my Pro's. That spot is very, very weak for how much one pays for them
[0:37:54] <k0tz_> game 3 was truly beautiful

[0:38:30] <DeadbyDustin> It the TimtheTatMan strat. If the game you play is miserable, just watch others play for content :)
[0:38:39] <MrNabmas> they use plastic where it should be metal, no excuse tbh for the price
[0:38:39] <ChaoticRenny> I'm still on my HyperX Alphas I need wireless ones so I stop running it over with my chair
[0:38:47] <Saint_Helix> No flom push it forward. Not the other side
[0:38:49] <EyderWulf> @fl0m he means pull it to the front, not the back
[0:38:56] <Koisong> @fl0m no instead of yanking it back, yank it forward
[0:38:58] <SupraUK_> i have semi-opens for that reason, so i don't need to take my headphones off

[1:04:01] <SupraUK_> !eu Basically this command also applies to Faceit
[1:04:01] <Nightbot> EU MM is easier because it works as intended. NA MM is more difficult because there's a higher proportion of cheaters and rank disparities make games difficult due to a smaller player base.

[1:34:14] <ImTetro> so i know a lot of people have asked this before but i lurk mostly in here, a vibe out. What is Silver Cast?
[1:34:15] <PerhapsItsPeach> SorrowInRain I was supreme but I've not played mm in well over a year
[1:34:17] <NZfaded> Craving silver content like an addict
[1:34:27] <H8BUSTAcap> I become a choke artist when I pick up an AWP KEKW
[1:34:43] <LowRatedHighlander> It requires a bit of coordination to counter and in a pug that’s hard to accomplish
[1:34:44] <doigtfurtif84> for flom an awp without scope could be well balanced
[1:34:44] <skarood> I see what you mean, minimal utility usage at a lower level
[1:34:45] <Shotgun_Chef> @fl0m the awp is a crutch for casual players

[2:04:39] <STatisfacti0n> the whole world has been trying to open up again and trying to fight the virus with vaccines. all fl0m heard was "stay at home" and he continues to sink further and further into reclusiveness PepeLaugh

[2:32:27] <Rob_Kebab> KEKPOINT

[2:32:37] <LucidR9> e plant is the absolute move
[2:32:46] <Darra5> How is E viable
[2:32:49] <Darra5> my god
[2:32:51] <LucidR9> by pressing e
[2:32:54] <LowRatedHighlander> @pappy_pud ah I must have looked away when that happened
[2:32:54] <KAILLICK> i use e
[2:33:01] <Pappy_Pud> e plant is the only way, left click planters belong in prison
[2:33:11] <LucidR9> left click plant makes me think im gonna try and fire my bomb
[2:33:13] <Darra5> I have never even thought about planting with E
[2:33:21] <Nai_OG> imagine using E as ur use keybond lol

[2:33:34] <asdfk1> fuckin zoomers and their e bomb plants
[2:33:37] <H8BUSTAcap> yea on the bombsite you press e once it will pull out the bomb and you hold e the second time it plants @mukulhayaran also if you hold E as you run around looking for the bomb as a cT it will defuse when you are in range

[2:33:45] <LucidR9> e is the OG way fym
[2:33:52] <LowRatedHighlander> @suprauk_ where is it?
[2:33:53] <BrotherJon> @SupraUK_ C - neither :)
[2:33:56] <enok92> hi flom, chat anomMLADY
[2:33:57] <praeter15> i forgot that you can plant with e
[2:34:01] <RegentZoran> Wait, what? Voding costs bits?
[2:34:02] <thej6s> I personally shift asdw one to the right and use w as my plant key
[2:34:05] <RegentZoran> The fuck is that?
[2:34:06] <goddarndoge> I use left click sometimes and E other times. Both are trash ways to plant tho so I just don't plant at all
[2:34:08] <asdfk1> LucidR9 maybe if youve never played any og cs
[2:34:11] <Darra5> Who are you? Erobb or something
[2:34:12] <jacob_752> do you press left click to defuse? didn't think so
[2:34:13] <SupraUK_> @RegentZoran extra votes cost bits, first one is free
[2:34:20] <joaquinguzmanloera7> apologies to everyone
[2:34:21] <Rob_Kebab> baby comms pog
[2:34:22] <LucidR9> im almost positive e plant was the original way
[2:34:22] <LowRatedHighlander> @suprauk_ nvm I found it. Damn mobile
[2:34:23] <KAILLICK> left click plant is the true zoomer way
[2:34:34] <RegentZoran> Oh, so I can swing the vote with money? xD
[2:34:36] <LowRatedHighlander> No extra votes cost bits
[2:34:42] <Pappy_Pud> someone pay bits to vote E so these weirdo left clickers dont get close
[2:34:42] <RegentZoran> Okay, that's actually hilarious xD
[2:34:43] <SorrowInRain> I use F for plant, so abstain smileW
[2:34:44] <LucidR9> e plant was the original way right fl0m?

[6:56:02] <Nightbot> i just care and i am not a hacker. its disengenious to pretend that the whole notion of prohibition in human society as a phenomena anywhere in recorded history, and I've looked as far back as the Sumerians. Ultimately, Fl0m, my only point is that internet anonymity is in the interest of the 1%. but that the illicit skins market is inflated by the 50 billion dollar skin market and its likely that the stakeholders are the same in both, ask your cybersecurity dad, he'll agree

[8:59:54] <waterbottle749> Dr disrespect
[8:59:59] <LowRatedHighlander> jjstrombone peep that clip
[9:00:09] <praeter15> mythic wants a big roster to choose frfom
[9:00:10] <ShallowSloth> consti thinks a stream team is dumb and fl0m is dumb and dumb mythic poopoo stinky
[9:00:13] <praeter15> so they keep doing tryouts
[9:00:20] <priiide_> Slugy sounds so sad ROFL
[9:00:22] <LowRatedHighlander> what sloth said NODDERS

[9:00:41] <jjstrombone> Thanks @LowRatedHighlander
[9:00:51] <macbookfps> as like a fake command
[9:00:52] <LowRatedHighlander> long story short a stream team isnt consti priority and if he gets an offer mid season he doesnt want to leave the team hanging
[9:00:54] <praeter15> budgetwaifu can we do a sucessful peepoBox now
[9:00:55] <STatisfacti0n> %? random BOP

[9:01:31] <jjstrombone> Honestly, that's a really mature way to handle the situation rather than potentially leaving the team for a better offer.
