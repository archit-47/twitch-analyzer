[1:17:44] <Lunatic_CSGO> Army gives lots of food
[1:17:44] <TheDoct0r97> 8 euros per month
[1:17:48] <Lunatic_CSGO> Army overfeeds you

[1:18:03] <TheDoct0r97> they give you food but you still end up paying a lot
[1:18:07] <Huskieee> @Nessa i mean most people choose the army, because it has the shortest option of 6 months
[1:18:08] <Lunatic_CSGO> I gained about 18 kg in army

[1:24:15] <Lunatic_CSGO> But yes, Nessa, 8 months is just a footman training, 11 months is lower commanding position training or vehicle driver training
[1:24:15] <Mikkel1591> thats good and bad at the same time

[2:57:25] <Hevar> att skriva korrekta källhänvisningar kan vara det tråkigaste som finns
[2:57:32] <Hevar> speciellt när man ska referera till pdf filer
[2:57:57] <kareemserry> hevar do you write them yourself? or use something like latex
[2:58:11] <Hevar> i write them myself
[2:58:13] <Leeo2406> neeej
[2:58:16] <kareemserry> oof
[2:58:38] <Huskieee> @Hevar just use a ref manager

[2:59:23] <Hevar> harvard system
[2:59:23] <Huskieee> cba to work less monkaS
[2:59:25] <Hevar> we dont use apa
[2:59:27] <Hevar> like u guys
[2:59:34] <kareemserry> yea it takes some time to learn how these things work but over time it saves you a lot of effort
[2:59:44] <Emmacoolgrill> men det suger ju för det är olika beroende på om du ska ha artikel online eller typ en hemsida
[2:59:44] <Proophit> can u show your mouse?
[2:59:53] <Emmacoolgrill> varför kan det inte bara vara likadant
[2:59:56] <Huskieee> I use Zotero as a reference manager
[3:00:01] <swartIing> I believe in APA supremacy
[3:00:08] <Hevar> nej men det är pdf filer på typ 15 sidor, ser ut som något från typ 1940
[3:00:12] <Hevar> så ska man ta reda på vart den är ifrån
[3:00:15] <Hevar> och referera
[3:00:28] <Emmacoolgrill> vi fick artiklar från 1995 till vår förra uppgift
[3:00:30] <kareemserry> I think there are tools online that will take a book or article and give you the harvard citation style
[3:00:30] <Emmacoolgrill> känns relevant
[3:00:42] <ramiro_masci> hi
