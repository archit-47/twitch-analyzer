[2:28:11] <fedoralva> Hey Fl0m, I just tried to run a B split on Inferno in casual, but we were met by 5 players on each site. Can you tell me what I did wrong? Like did I lose before I even started by playing casual? Or is it because I didn't use code Fl0m to buy some Nathan's Famous which made me hangryso I didm't realize I was in Casual until round 3?

[3:23:42] <jjstrombone> @Lordstorm875 MmmHmm KEKWiggle
[3:23:42] <MartinPhD> i want to just kindap a bunch of cs players and just analyze their brains to figure out why tf they are such braindead psychos
[3:23:47] <extradical> a real communist doesnt share shit, his government does
[3:23:47] <Dewhz> sorry flom I was a political scientist, my brain was corrupted
[3:23:49] <LowRatedHighlander> !scrims
[3:23:49] <TheSlackaholic> imagine needing aimlab if all you play is CS...
[3:23:49] <Nightbot> "wat but dey got 16 rouns y dey no winner?" Well you see, this is a scrim, a type of practice where two teams usually play out a full 30 rounds.
[3:23:50] <RealCommunist> whasts the point of playing out 30 if you won already?
[3:23:50] <Tvjuli> yeah you tellhim
[3:23:56] <LowRatedHighlander> hey

[3:23:59] <priiide_> !scrim RealCommunist
[3:23:59] <Nightbot> RealCommunist, Scrims are usually played a full 30 rounds for practice reasons. so thats why the score is weird.
[3:24:00] <Lordstorm875> its a scrim its practice.
[3:24:01] <LowRatedHighlander> !rules
[3:24:01] <Nightbot> 1) No politics/religion/covid 2) No extended copy/pasta. 3) This isn't a trade forum. 4) No begging. 5) English only! 6) No promos. 7) No betting talk. 8) Just generally don't be an idiot.
[3:24:05] <LowRatedHighlander> no 1 dammit
[3:24:11] <Raithorn> @fl0m you should do a viewer survey for a week or something i wanna know what chat thinks about shit
[3:24:23] <Dewhz> I bet I can break every rule in a single comment
[3:24:25] <Tvjuli> Can I get a pass on #8? LowRatedHighlander
[3:24:25] <LowRatedHighlander> RealCommunist its about practice

[3:24:39] <Nightbot> This video breaks down all of fl0m's in-game settings including his sensitivity: https://youtu.be/_-T7DudLqLY?t=26
[3:24:40] <RealCommunist> hmm the scrims we played were 16 rounds on faceit
[3:24:46] <LowRatedHighlander> Tvjuli everyone in chat gets a pass on that one in one way or another
[3:24:48] <RealCommunist> maybe thats a configuration in the ESEA server
[3:24:57] <Doccy> this isn't an esea server first off
[3:24:57] <Tvjuli> BLANKIES
[3:24:59] <sloveCS> why would you ever play a 16 round scrim?
[3:25:04] <StochasticDiscount> !beardoil
[3:25:05] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKW
[3:25:05] <Doccy> and if you are ending a scrim at 16 rounds won
[3:25:06] <extradical> what do you call a professional slots machine player?
[3:25:17] <Doccy> then you are missing out on an entire half to practice strats on
[3:25:20] <nuke_cs> extradical broke?
[3:25:20] <RealCommunist> im more amazed that hes reading my comments while executing lol
[3:25:23] <RealCommunist> that takes some practice
[3:25:24] <Doccy> the goal of a scrim isn't to win
[3:25:24] <extradical> LUL
[3:25:31] <Doccy> it's to practice and work out strats
[3:25:38] <priiide_> RealCommunist professional streamer
[3:25:39] <RealCommunist> nice shots
[3:25:58] <sloveCS> once you get to main teams start playing out
[3:26:05] <sloveCS> hard to get teams to play out beforehand they just dc
[3:26:07] <TheSlackaholic> CS/Halo ruined the FPS genre forever
[3:26:13] <Dewhz> real communist you should start a stream where you just read communist literature while surfing
[3:26:23] <RealCommunist> lmfaoooo
[3:26:24] <Tvjuli> TheSlackaholic why D:
[3:26:28] <RealCommunist> that would be hilarious actually
[3:26:30] <nuke_cs> sloveCS every team in open dcs once someone hits 16 its cringe

[3:26:56] <sloveCS> only time we want to end it at 16 is if its a one sided scrim and its not worth it to continue
[3:26:59] <TheSlackaholic> CS started the lower learning curve less strategic less mechanical skill style of play and Halo created the asinine concept that FPS could work on a controller
