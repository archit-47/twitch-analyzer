[0:38:25] <saurabhkarki1> @hobrev he is already benched LUL
[0:38:26] <yaafly> I don't see Magisk replacing RUSH ngl
[0:38:26] <dsmokeeeee> warup @fl0m
[0:38:29] <star_made123> But all depends if olof wants to play
[0:38:30] <FiberZ_> LUL
[0:38:31] <spitfirebo> olof was on one at cologne
[0:38:35] <saad0006> @saad0006 No idea dude. That's why I was asking Flom
[0:38:38] <SukksGaming> replacing olof KEKPOINT NO
[0:38:40] <furdahcs> I mean faze isn't exactly smart
[0:38:42] <Undoubted> PartyHat PartyHat PartyHat PartyHat
[0:38:43] <hobrev> oh he is? my bad
[0:38:46] <NERVg> It all works on this assumption that Olof doesnt want to keep playing as well I think

[0:39:05] <spitfirebo> I think its more likely a new organisation picks them up
[0:39:08] <n0r13k> Olof looked super good on LAN, it's absolutely insane how he has recovered from all of that IRL stuff.

[0:39:41] <n0r13k> I hope that we see GeT_RiGhT back on the competitive scene at some point, I still feel like he can offer a lot.
[0:39:42] <zonked_dude> !hours
[0:39:43] <17sammonster> @fl0m but considering sudden rise in faze and astralis's performance... wasn't this same type of faze we saw before Niko left
[0:39:47] <saurabhkarki1> @MiraiShikimi probably looking for new IGL. I doubt they'll bring Golden back to starting roster after looking to remake teh entire team.
[0:39:49] <yobtih> pro CS is boring, there are to many tourney's and too many teams for me to care about it. I will watch NA CS but not this shit show of a comp scene
[0:39:49] <007deman> I hate that any benched cs pro just moves to valorant bc of lack of opportunities in cs :(

[1:44:06] <Nightbot> I just find it very interesting in a world where I say something that is just simply a little debatable statement. Get INSTANTLY banned. Then I get called "Stupid." AFTER I get banned, and talked about like I don't know what's going on with no chance to defend myself whatsoever. But people can say things like, "fuck my ass." and just obligerant statements that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. An I'm the stupid one? That's just so interesting to me. Explain?

Originally I laughed, but he ignored me until I opened up the Twitch app on my phone and gifted the five. He proceeded to pull some sort of mug from his ass and wave it in my face, saying "hey anon, thanks for the five mcgifties" and complemented my penis.

[1:59:34] <jockst3r> @fl0m in normal mm you can check in consol not in the new mm though
[1:59:36] <c0rkmcnortis> might have to enable dev console it's not on by default orangeflu
[1:59:39] <ogakuh> %? I'll go positive in today's matches
[1:59:40] <Nightbot> Joris says 65%
[1:59:40] <shiny_steelix> u can still check console
[1:59:41] <Archit47> you should enable the console from game settings
[1:59:41] <jockst3r> I believe at least
[1:59:44] <shiny_steelix> after the round
[1:59:44] <jockst3r> might be wrong
[1:59:46] <m0FFFFF> i think we know
[1:59:47] <Saint_Helix> Wokege
[1:59:54] <orangeflu> @c0rkmcnortis console is enabled, i fumbled around with it for a bit
[1:59:54] <Holstaura> back to 4 blood splats = 30 damage PepeLaugh
[1:59:57] <hobrev> you can only see it in console after the round ends these days
[1:59:59] <siiiif> too much work gengarDumper
[2:00:00] <Rage_KaGe11> in premier mode if you don't pay for the $1 stats you can't see your damage at all
[2:00:06] <orangeflu> tbh i didnt try looking there to see the damage
[2:00:06] <iDPSi> console is there but not in premier
[2:00:09] <MrKildal89> %? i win a game today
[2:00:09] <Nightbot> Joris says 65%
[2:00:09] <hobrev> at least in the premium thing where you vote
[2:00:10] <bluehipp0> wtf, I get an "Air Quality Alert" by my weather app? what does that even mean??
[2:00:18] <furdahcs> orangeflu also make sure you go to settings -> game -> item and turn off auto switch on pickup
[2:00:20] <iDPSi> like finding the dmg numbers I mean
[2:00:20] <SkuZ2y> @fl0m makes surf so much easier than it is lol xD
[2:00:23] <TheOneEyedKnight> peepoRiot show tiddy peepoRiot
[2:00:24] <siiiif> bluehipp0 just dont breathe 4Head
[2:00:24] <c0rkmcnortis> orangeflu it's not intuitive at all KEKW
[2:00:28] <Saint_Helix> @bluehipp0 it means it sucks to breathe outside.
[2:00:31] <nmars_> who is Obvious- and quit trying to queue snipe
[2:00:32] <ogakuh> @bluehipp0 too many people farting
[2:00:35] <m0FFFFF> gaben is a semen demon
[2:00:36] <MrKildal89> yeah joris says my losing streak is over
[2:00:37] <w0rseN> dam bluehippo you in china?
[2:00:37] <hobrev> you can see the damage, but only after the round ends
[2:00:47] <yobtih> in ESEA League games you get no damage stats
[2:00:50] <nerkkin> This surf map is Lowkey kinda poo
[2:00:51] <hobrev> and only in console
[2:01:00] <Holstaura> oh I've played this map didn't recognize it until this ramp lol
[2:01:00] <orangeflu> @furdahcs what, why? seems like that is what i want
[2:01:04] <bluehipp0> apparently it's for Fine Particulates Concentrations that are too high or approach unhealthy standards
[2:01:07] <grizzzlywizzzly> what is this garbage 1080p setting
[2:01:10] <c0rkmcnortis> in my MM games i get no damage, but that's just because im bad
[2:01:12] <Boonmonster> whats happening
[2:01:12] <furdahcs> orangeflu itll get you killed more than itll help you
[2:01:16] <Boonmonster> wyere are the games
[2:01:18] <bluehipp0> so I guess I just stop breathing now.
[2:01:21] <bluehipp0> COPIUM
[2:01:23] <Saint_Helix> !1080p
[2:01:23] <Nightbot> 936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.

[2:55:08] <m0FFFFF> its just insane amount of caffeine
[2:55:10] <c0rkmcnortis> from wiki: Café Cubano (also known as Cuban espresso, Cuban coffee, cafecito, Cuban pull, and Cuban shot) is a type of espresso that originated in Cuba. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened (traditionally with natural brown sugar which has been whipped with the first and strongest drops of espresso).[1] However, the name is sometimes used to refer to coffee-based drinks that include Cuban espresso as their main ingredient, such as café con leche.
[2:55:10] <bolottekid> theHovnival peepoHuggers

[5:35:24] <Nightbot> Fl0m uses 936p as it provides the best quality at the optimal bitrate - !encoder for a more technical breakdown

[5:35:49] <gomDxx> !1080p
[5:35:49] <Nightbot> 936p was causing issues due to his resolution, so he changed to 1080p due to it working better with his setup.

[5:36:20] <Dointhedirds> !encoder
[5:36:20] <Nightbot> H.264 encoding works by breaking up the video into 8x8 pixel blocks, so if you have a resolution that doesn't divide cleanly by 8 in both directions, it has to make blocks at the edges that are only partially used. (thanks Schmiddtyy)

[6:41:26] <Mountie888> my biggest beef with this game is A) constant, massive updates and B) they buff new guns so much you HAVE to play with them, but as a casual i never max it before they nerf it or come out with an even mroe OP gun
