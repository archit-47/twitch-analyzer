[0:41:41] <ThrowIfNotJett> Bro you can just scan it and it moves all of ur accounts over if ur using google Authenticator
[0:41:42] <gmor_> BOOMER Clap
[0:41:46] <cs_java> @GriefnChief just an edge one, not like an otter box or life proof

[0:42:19] <Scrillee> its going downhill aint it gmor_ FEelsBadMan
[0:42:21] <marcus7445> fl0m do you prefer t side on overpass?
[0:42:22] <GriefnChief> @cs_java yh i just got one after i dropped my phone and shattered the screen. no i feel all safe
[0:42:22] <nilllow> thats ridiculous
[0:42:25] <GriefnChief> now*
[0:42:27] <andrewmedaTV> sounds liek that was a facebook account
[0:42:28] <hceqi> did liquid win yestetfsu, snf motr
[0:42:30] <About40Midgetz> I mean better safe than sorry
[0:42:30] <RMXCrossal> Thnx for the sub fl0m widepeepoHappy

[0:42:30] <frogoree> co stream with gtr? PauseFish
[0:42:33] <ascanar6lack> PORNHUB
[0:42:35] <bluehipp0> SMS is not encrypted really
[0:42:35] <SupraUK_> sim cloning is a thing
[0:42:37] <otc_kaffy> Signal is de wai.
[0:42:38] <SupraUK_> it's bad
[0:42:38] <nilllow> it should be way easier in this day and age
[0:42:39] <About40Midgetz> SMS can be spoofedpretty easy
[0:42:40] <andrewmedaTV> sms is very insecure and unreliable
[0:42:40] <Konstantinovi> rlewisMoron
[0:42:40] <SupraUK_> really, really bad
[0:42:45] <HDFlood_> WHO SAID SMS WHY
[0:42:45] <hceqi> Did liquid win yesterday, and more important, did Mythic win ? :D
[0:42:46] <SuprenDe> And even beyond security, SMS is just unreliable garbage
[0:42:48] <marcus7445> imessage should do a pretty good job
[0:42:48] <amutantcookie> SMS is just bad too
[0:42:48] <EddieVengeance> @fl0m your nowegian bloodline is why you are able to grow that beard LUL
[0:42:50] <SupraUK_> social engineering is also a thing
[0:42:50] <HDFlood_> Oops caps
[0:42:51] <Cacemen> SMS is not the way to 2fa
[0:42:52] <S1MPathetic> Just get a phone and let your grandson do the work BOOMER
[0:42:54] <CharlieElm> I mean, if someone can tap into your messages, you're already pretty compromised
[0:42:57] <cassieblacc> MMS is where its at
[0:42:57] <Destructoid5858> Android SMS is the epitome of never updating
[0:43:00] <znck19> lcuky bot
[0:43:02] <SuperTuscan888> lucky jeeps whiffin
[0:43:04] <SuperTuscan888> keeps*
[0:43:06] <ThrowIfNotJett> Google sim swap
[0:43:10] <bluehipp0> funny thing is: IRS accounts only allow you to use SMS for 2FA! KEKW
[0:43:13] <kab1as> Well in that case it would be even more important to upgrade. If your current phone one day just drops dead (which it really might considering its cndition) you'd be locked out of 2FA in a much worse way.
[0:43:16] <gmor_> audio is off DansGame
[0:43:17] <vdoodzz> The world is consumed by people addicted to phones

[2:13:30] <Destructoid5858> If you ask me, Astralis should just become an m249 only team. The m249 is the strongest weapon in the game. It actually has no spray pattern and a near infinite amount of bullets. Astralis and just rev those bad boys up and wave them around and not even Zywoo and S1mple on their best days could touch them.

[2:26:48] <Shotgun_Chef> @paapoWeird flexing you know girls
[2:26:50] <bruhandon46> Remember guys, 11-4 half
[2:26:51] <ShrapTy> that makes sense, but seems like a double edged sword thanks fl0m
[2:26:51] <GiraffePig> I mean Mythic had Keiti for a while so that's a mixed roster in Premier, probably the highest level mixed roster?
[2:26:57] <l1qu1dmayne> l1qu1dmayne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! look at this baby back

[2:26:58] <bailey_playzzz> Thanks fl0m <3
[2:26:58] <SupraUK_> @guiltxoxo there's no men's tournaments - just listen my guy
[2:26:59] <bigfani> NODDERS
[2:26:59] <rev3rbjunkie> so theoretically we could have a female zywoo soon.
[2:27:00] <herbn> women are allowed to play in the NBA, there's no rule against it, but they also have the WNBA. it's like that for CS too
[2:27:01] <nuke_cs> isnt vicious kitties a mixed team?
[2:27:08] <JamesHolmes97> @guiltxoxo there is no such thing as a mens tournament
[2:27:10] <AOR_Oliver> It’s about trying to encourage women to game as there’s some dickheads who don’t know how to act
[2:27:12] <kamelski> @fl0m  what about a senior league?
[2:27:18] <OGWerp> @guiltxoxo There are no men only tournys
[2:27:19] <wyldeg> wait, im back. where's the facecam fl0m?
[2:27:21] <chickenuggetz2> I wanna see fl0m Sadge

[2:27:29] <SupraUK_> @wyldeg stuffing his face
[2:27:30] <mohammadreza99a> why is Dupreeh not calling for Astralis?
[2:27:30] <HerrRhodes> seriously wish more teams picked up or promoted women on thier rosters or women only rosters. more cs is only better for the scene
[2:27:34] <Treshkj> Everytime theres a woman playing a match with me, there's always some toxic dude saying some nasty shit, its no wonder there are few women playing :(
[2:27:36] <Squabbler> so if you play in women's only, you can't participate in mixed? one or the other?
[2:27:36] <BenForFriends> @chickenuggetz2 He's still destroying his sandwich
[2:27:36] <Nomad182> @wyldeg no facecam while stuffing face peepoFAT
[2:27:38] <rockstatv> Vitality comeback rn to win series
[2:27:43] <wyldeg> ah damn
[2:27:44] <hobrev> its a shame that there really is so little female representation at the highest level of any esports, like you have Geguri but thats about it
[2:27:46] <bluehipp0> it would be interesting though to do a study somehow on CS-related skills comparison between random men and women... but the problem probably is that you cannot find a good unbiased group of people with similar exposure
[2:27:47] <ekj123> fake comeback or real comeback?
[2:27:48] <bolottekid> Treshkj Sadge
[2:27:48] <Stogie6> @Dankner I do miss that one part of my old job.  That sales guy bringing Schwartz's a couple times a year was a highlight
[2:27:51] <Karna_69> is glave allowed to call a round??
[2:27:52] <Demea_> hypothetically, if chat were to start a completely unfounded rumor that fl0m was the dad of a pro player, who would it be?
[2:27:56] <paapoWeird> Treshkj more women play than you think, they just either 5 stack or don't talk
[2:27:58] <Shotgun_Chef> 16-14 script?
[2:27:58] <SupraUK_> oof

[2:36:16] <hobrev> that is the reason why I dont really like lettuce in sandwich
[2:36:17] <Scornfulboot_eu> totally agree
[2:36:17] <skyj_> most tomatoes aren't served at appropriate ripeness
[2:36:17] <zombiej0n> miracle whip or margarine or mayo?
[2:36:18] <ayymam> astralis got the liquid fever
[2:36:19] <GreavenTV> also, crispy not burnt, that's also something people get wrong
[2:36:21] <jonnypondwater> no tomatoes on sandwich? how do i unsub
[2:36:22] <stucko> astralis potential choke monkaW
[2:36:22] <vuowng> this match is getting toasty
[2:36:22] <Jaerdekartt> if you make your own sandwich then tomatoes don't make it soggy
[2:36:23] <bluehipp0> bacon has to be crisp enough to break some teeth
[2:36:24] <shiry0> imagine not toasting
[2:36:24] <SupraUK_> butter the bread?
[2:36:25] <flexluthertv> then how tomato make soggy?
[2:36:30] <Tors0_> yeah nothing like a crisp egg salad

[2:36:44] <long_hands_02> exactly tomatoes suck in a sandwich
[2:36:45] <Scornfulboot_eu> if the lettice has bite its nice
[2:36:47] <SwifferWetWiener> tomato on sandwich just feels like watermelon on sandwich
[2:36:48] <Dankner> Tomatoes are the food equivalent to stepping in a puddle
[2:36:49] <Digital_Everett> ive got an avocado ready for the avocado toast in a few hours.

[2:55:18] <umaroreis> @fl0m do you think an established academy league is the key of the CS scene flourish and continue providing talent?

[2:55:22] <Mentalstatemike> jesus
[2:55:25] <mukulhayaran> F
[2:55:26] <berserk2560> TearGlove
[2:55:49] <coellian33> @fl0m MICHU also joined VP when it started sinking and that's pretty much the highlight of his career which is really sad because he is a really good player and one of the veterans of polish cs
[2:55:51] <xFIKKx> went to VP as that roster started to collapse, then Envy which was a terrible situation, and then to this EG situation is very unfortunate for someone hyped to be the next young god.
[2:55:55] <hobrev> michu was one of the polish talent that waited for years to get a chance on VP and then only got it after the team had crashed out of the tier 1 for real
[2:55:56] <keegle1> Got on Twitter after work, and saw Fl0m POV for that scout ACE last night. Safe to say I got hard. Nice cock, nice shot.

[4:22:34] <hceqi> @fl0m  I use AUG, not because I am pro, but because of my boomer eyes xD
[4:22:40] <eclipse42> EG just needs to pick up shaGuar and blackpanther ez wins
[4:22:40] <FlameyKumori> Plenty of people use it as a crutch, cause if they don't have an aug they stop getting kills.
[4:22:43] <exc1ave> I hate the little heads on the mini map
[4:22:44] <dankiyy> aug is insane
[4:22:47] <SoporificPanda> everyone in pugs should buy aug because they suck with utility anyway so why waste money on a smoke or flash anyway
[4:22:47] <DanOBrien416> @fl0m I'm sure you've explained it dozens of times but why do you rock a1s over a4?
[4:22:49] <xFIKKx> @hceqi exactly why i use it
[4:22:57] <a_HamHawk> @fl0m why does the pro level make the aug "extra" expensive?
[4:22:58] <dankiyy> tech pause i need a fat one
[4:22:59] <CaptainPositivity> "b-b-but its a COD weapon >:( only giant noobs use scopes"
[4:22:59] <TestTubeBaba> nice nade
[4:23:01] <Uwotm08> AUG it up... You want to AUG it up...
[4:23:05] <Gearslayer360> its better than the numbers yep

[4:23:28] <Brekkjern> We need the steam PF pics instead of numbers in game too! I need to be able to see the ahegao faces around the map when I play.
[4:23:28] <thej6s> In this game it's alright, but when all the faces look the same it can get a bit hard with the faces on the map

[4:25:26] <Brekkjern> I'm all for shapes as long as the one who suggested it will always have a dick as their shape.
[4:25:27] <soulofselesnya> we should assign a unique nft to each player
[4:25:28] <vrahim> Maybe body shape ? xD
[4:25:28] <FlameyKumori> what about shapes, numbers and colors?

[4:26:02] <shiry0> my shape dont change neither
[4:26:03] <devanb97> Should use letters instead of shapes bro, much easier
[4:26:04] <JugalK> dibs on the shapes

[4:32:19] <soulofselesnya> niko was the 4th ranked in 2020
[4:32:24] <sundarah> ax1le
[4:32:25] <MuerteMan> More Bo3 is best too! Bo5 is just too effing long
[4:32:33] <LucidR9> Im assuming you guys have already talked about k0nfig to astralis @fl0m

[4:32:42] <dankiyy> twistzz is maybe a better aimer yes

[4:34:17] <soulofselesnya> NOOOOO
[4:34:17] <cloud_zenn> i prefer zywoo's aim over s1mple
[4:34:19] <sebcl42> Michu KEKW
[4:34:22] <dankiyy> and is probably one of the best aimers
[4:34:22] <AedanE1> Consistency is key when talking about the best in the world
[4:34:26] <soulofselesnya> that was ar eally bad whiff
[4:34:27] <vinciCS> so is that why you call all of us beautiful fl0m pepeSus
[4:34:28] <toelo0se> How do you feel about NAF @fl0m
[4:34:29] <preachur> I think EG want to get done with this and get back home
[4:34:29] <joemozzie> stewie's the best rifler because he uses the gear peepoW
[4:34:29] <EliteSydney> As long as you get the kill VoHiYo
[4:34:29] <dankiyy> raw aim that it
[4:34:31] <LucidR9> s1mple's aim is not aesthetically pleasing at all
[4:34:32] <dankiyy> is*
[4:34:37] <siiiif> yeah but who has the nicer cock fl0m Peepo
[4:34:43] <mukulhayaran> Peepo
[4:34:43] <airfrycs> lmfao ^
[4:34:46] <PastaMarinara> who else is in that top 5? @fl0m
[4:34:52] <soulofselesnya> s1mples aim doesnt look super good yea
[4:34:58] <LucidR9> it's super jittery
[4:35:00] <Krims0n__> tense1983 has the best aim tbh
[4:35:00] <TLsmf> clean crisp lock bois
[4:35:01] <preachur> Twistzz is hotter than Elige though
[4:35:01] <LucidR9> s1mples that is
[4:35:02] <peepofat852> Thank you @fl0m for agreeing with me cause elige is my 1st pick when it comes to rifler
[4:35:08] <RyanGDS> how has elige been so consistent for so long
[4:35:08] <nasander> Zywoo imo one of the best riflers :O :O
[4:35:09] <peepofat852> Maybe rain comes second in my mind
[4:35:12] <bolottekid> Nc
[4:35:12] <Nightbot> Nice Cock, bro! NICECOCK
[4:35:15] <CaptainPositivity> @preachur DansGame
[4:35:15] <SoporificPanda> elige so boring. he just always puts his crosshair in the place it needs to be. i want to see someone throw out their shoulder to get a kill
[4:35:17] <dankiyy> yeah s1 looks shaky so its unpleasant to watch ngl

[4:36:58] <LucidR9> fl0m there were so many reasons cold should've gone to FURIA, atleast a brazilian of them
[4:36:59] <m4lki3r> liquid locking this down
