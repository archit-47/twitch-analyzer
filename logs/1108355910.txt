[1:31:57] <macbookfps> well
[1:32:00] <macbookfps> rip doubters
[1:32:00] <LucidR9> You know they say all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one with another wrestler you got a fifty/fifty chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak, and I'm not normal! So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me! And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix? You-the chances of winning drasticy go down.
[1:32:02] <macbookfps> they're broke

[1:33:41] <Nomad182> peepoCoffee
[1:33:48] <LucidR9> See, the 3-Way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, cuz Kurt Angle KNOOOWS he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try. So, Samoa Joe, you take your thirty three and a third chance minus my twenty five percent chance (if we was to go one on one) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning at Sacrifice. But then you take my 75 perchance-chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds…p

[2:30:28] <praeter15> i think CSGO twitter could post a literally image of shit and people would count 2 poop logs and think it confirms source 2

[2:31:05] <siiiif> praeter15 the number 2 appears twice in that message peepoFoil
[2:31:15] <c0rkmcnortis> csgo twitter could post "we are done updating this dogshit game, go play krunker" and people would think it's source 2

[2:32:05] <StochasticDiscount> Queuing ranked CSGO after like 7 years is super intimidating.
[2:32:06] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah that and the big crack down on boosted accounts with the premier changes is good as well
[2:32:11] <c0rkmcnortis> peepoAngy fl0m you don't have to be loud for an asmr farting stream
[2:32:13] <Tvjuli> Valve can update the skin in the zeus and the community would go wild. We are just that desperate

[2:32:27] <Shy_tx> OneOfUs
[2:32:28] <LowRatedHighlander> zeus skin would be Pog
[2:32:35] <c0rkmcnortis> Tvjuli tbh id be happier with a zeus skin than changes to MM
[2:32:37] <SukksGaming> what was that first flash?
[2:32:51] <LowRatedHighlander> its a new game with a much larger dev team sadly so they
[2:33:00] <H8BUSTAcap> zuse skin confirmed!?? peepoFoil
[2:33:09] <gilbilly_> Meat, cows, pigs, humans, lamb,
[2:33:09] <StochasticDiscount> @Tvjuli good and bad. Valorant is game designed to be updated. CSGO is a game designed to be basically interesting regardless of updats.
[2:33:23] <praeter15> what if instead of allowing you to buy the A4 and A1S you could buy skins directly from the buy menu
[2:33:25] <Brian_JV> next update adds jett knives
[2:33:29] <c0rkmcnortis> valorant updates bring the inevitibility of power creep, with every new character being broken for some time or nerfed to death smileW
[2:33:39] <StochasticDiscount> Exactly cock
[2:33:41] <praeter15> c0rkmcnortis thats how apex is starting to become :)
[2:33:41] <siiiif> what if you could but Valorant guns in CS Peepo
[2:33:44] <Tvjuli> true, but MM its so important for the game and so broken that you either take the time and effort to get faceit or you just quit like shroud did
[2:33:51] <Shy_tx> NO
[2:34:02] <H8BUSTAcap> @StochasticDiscount yea but cs players are not nerds who want their champions to be fantasy garbo with super powers... KEKW
[2:34:10] <praeter15> Tvjuli most people arent playing in majors like shroud did :)
[2:34:15] <LowRatedHighlander> i am curious to see how they deal with new agents later on. i cant imagine they can keep up with this pace like they do with league and champions
[2:34:15] <theBaboda> @c0rkmcnortis did you play overwatch for more than like 20 hours?
[2:34:22] <gilbilly_> Enemy green swag
[2:34:26] <StochasticDiscount> What if you could put CSGO util in Valorant Peepo
[2:34:28] <c0rkmcnortis> theBaboda never played OW
[2:34:35] <praeter15> theres not much you can do with a tac shooter LowRatedHighlander PepeLaugh
[2:34:40] <siiiif> when will Valorant add big tiddy goth gf? Peepo
[2:34:52] <praeter15> how many more flash and molly characters do we need before a character gets a nuke
[2:35:02] <StochasticDiscount> @LowRatedHighlander it inevitably becomes a worse game over time. IMO, of course.
[2:35:02] <praeter15> siiiif you mean viper Peeposit
[2:35:03] <H8BUSTAcap> ^^ that might make me switch @siiiif  KEKW
[2:35:06] <LowRatedHighlander> praeter15 exactly. like theres only so much you can do without changing the game entirely right?
[2:35:07] <MegaGeese> praeter15 raze already exists
[2:35:23] <Tvjuli> @praeter15 I mean like he did in his stream where he tried to play, failed and went to val talking mad shit to cs
[2:35:24] <c0rkmcnortis> it's just really telling that valorant is choosing to add new characters at a far greater rate than maps, replay system, per-agent controls etc. it's about shiny new abilities not core gameplay
[2:35:36] <siiiif> Skye is best girl Peeposit
[2:35:39] <LowRatedHighlander> i think it just depends on if they value a new agent more than keeping the game balanced. and with riot that can be a bit sketchy
[2:35:40] <praeter15> siiiif no
[2:35:41] <theBaboda> c0rkmcnortis OW had that same issue which made me hate playing it. It felt like it was always in that every new update something would break and one character would be able to 1v6 a team
