[3:15:53] <greenteasake> @fl0m FUCKING PREACH, I told my kid, this whole MCU bullshit is just so they could do this, make a TV show for every fucking Marvel character and milk people's bank accounts
[3:15:54] <SukksGaming> What if was the greatest yes NODDERS
[3:16:01] <davaddacarry> my wife loved the scarlet witch one
[3:16:05] <Ewy_Qwarp> wandavision was really bad
[3:16:07] <ohmissyme> WandaVision thoughhhh!!!
[3:16:09] <Puddin_Wing> am i the only person that's watched What If?
[3:16:09] <SukksGaming> Wandavision was too slow
[3:16:13] <STatisfacti0n> I think Wandavision started out great. I also strongly dislike Darcy as a character
[3:16:15] <waferthinmint> @fl0m who do you like in Soprano's so far everyone kills a lot of innocent people.
[3:16:15] <XaRaX_OG> G2 & Vitality chilling together is so wholesome
[3:16:20] <faxe_> The Marvel universe is now just milking people lmao, it's not bad, it's just low-tier

[3:16:28] <cronican> i watched wandavision but I forgot that I did until just now

[3:17:06] <CharlieElm> You kinda have to have an appreciation to the broader universe and references to comic book lore, otherwise, yeah, it's just "more Marvel"
[3:17:06] <Puddin_Wing> my boy vesemir
[3:17:07] <STatisfacti0n> Loki was really good though imo. Wandavision started out strong and I loved what they were going for but then Darcy came into the picture and ruined it for me

[3:50:33] <GFYMeowMix> chi pol tay KEKW
[3:50:34] <batsbanaan_> that was the funny
[3:50:38] <Jek57> why does the stream keep replaying every 5 seconds its so annoying
[3:50:39] <moose2949> We get it because it tastes good and you can take a shit the next day that feels like you are giving birth for $10
[3:50:42] <Mentalstatemike> KEKW

[3:50:52] <iVex> McDonalds sells burritos
[3:50:54] <scabs_tv> i used to be like that then i realized that actual mexican is both cheaper and better
[3:50:59] <supra_nightmare> thats a very cali take on shit KEKW
[3:51:00] <BizarreMark> OMEGALUL
[3:51:01] <greenteasake> @moose2949 lol
[3:51:02] <rwreyford> I don't even know if i'd call chipotle tex-max lmao

[3:52:05] <BeWeiser14> Chipotle is "healthy" which is why I have a problem with it. They present themselves as healthy when they really aren't if you look at the overall nutrition facts lol
[3:52:06] <lumi1210> chat has best conversations when food is involved

[3:53:41] <BeWeiser14> @priiide_ If it fits the macros its never a problem. But when people prioritize it over homemade foods because its a "healthier" option thats when I have a problem with it.
[3:53:41] <rwreyford> My chipotle order is literally just a double scoop of chicken. no toppings or rice, am i broken?
