[0:56:08] <n0r13k> Fun fact. When Hoohaa meme'd about giving up his job to go pro in CS, I took him seriously and it made me reflect on how unhappy I was in my "dream job". I resigned from it and have been attempting to get a better job, and I had the call earlier on today saying that it's all confirmed - with a start date. Absolute POGGERS
[0:56:09] <mk_48> sure why not. what you said
[0:56:10] <so4pybox> as long as the casters know what theyre doing i personally dont see the casters as a big deal
[0:56:12] <Archit47> its a compromise Peepo
[0:56:15] <sealer9> People always going to complain no matter who’s on the lineup
[0:56:18] <caerbannog_> Omg no hugo and harry ??

[2:25:12] <ttibseN> YES
[2:25:14] <Piethrouer> the last operation was the same
[2:25:15] <sloveCS> no
[2:25:15] <Zeyzo_> SHRUGGERS yep
[2:25:15] <praeter15> thats how all operation cases work Peepo
[2:25:15] <ttibseN> YOU ARE CORRECT
[2:25:15] <Jaerdekartt> thought they did it last operation too
[2:25:15] <shiry0> you can sell the cases now
[2:25:15] <DurOIOP> ahh someone that didn't die trying to say my name and just said Dur, let's gooo
[2:25:16] <FlameyKumori> last opertaion had a star only case
[2:25:17] <MikeTysonsPinky> broken fang was as well
[2:25:18] <nahitsmedical> broken fang too right?
[2:25:19] <pepegiggles> the cases don't have drops?
[2:25:19] <MellowedOut> Same thing happened with the last case, though
[2:25:19] <Huddlesworth> GabeN pretty cool huh
[2:25:20] <silviu_cs> Not the first time but you're right
[2:25:20] <Archit47> last operation also had case for stars
[2:25:20] <bonkerz93> last operation was somewhat the same
[2:25:21] <juraj20000> @fl0m what happened to the fl0m copying pros settings
[2:25:22] <supra_nightmare> or they might just be converted to regular cases and you can buy them through the market with a real money
[2:25:22] <Digobrah> Flom do you live from streaming? Is it possible in these days?
[2:25:23] <sloveCS> @fl0m snakebite case still drops
[2:25:23] <BoeJoula> last operation was like that too
[2:25:24] <Huddlesworth> GabeN stonks
[2:25:25] <SoNftw> Broken fang was like that too.
[2:25:25] <whitechocolate64> broken fang was the same
[2:25:26] <a732v> dont they get added to the drops
[2:25:26] <TenGee36> Knowing valve they will make the dropped
[2:25:28] <sjoerdtheman> NODDERS fl0mSmort
[2:25:29] <ttibseN> NO CUZ THE SKINS ARE WANK
[2:25:38] <ThrowIfNotJett> yo
[2:25:39] <LowRatedHighlander> They did this with the last operation fl0m
[2:25:39] <Justhoohaa> after the operation they will drop in game
[2:25:40] <totalmacage> wasnt shattered web kinda the same too
[2:25:42] <praeter15> fl0m all operation cases are like that Peepo
[2:25:46] <MellowedOut> the shattered web was the same too I'm pretty sure
[2:25:46] <bezaar_> @fl0m I unboxed a knife last night - second gold in 6 months, pretty pumped!
[2:25:49] <Zeyzo_> the collection skins will go up tho fl0m
[2:25:51] <nahitsmedical> knives will be in the dreams and nightmares case I assume as well
[2:25:53] <silviu_cs> Plus there won't be as many as the other cases because not everyone has the patience to wait 8 days to trade/sell the cases
[2:25:54] <Jaerdekartt> I think they didn't want another hydra situation with the cases
[2:25:55] <hobrev> they might make the cases drop regularly sometime in the future
[2:25:55] <gl1tterbeam> every operation has had their own unique case that never drops again
[2:25:56] <ttibseN> idc the skins are the new case are so shite i cant even cap to you man
[2:26:09] <Piethrouer> Did you see the living situation for players at the international
[2:26:11] <Ra1n1ngDeath> @gl1tterbeam not true
[2:26:14] <juraj20000> @fl0m what happened to the fl0m copying pros settings
[2:26:16] <harrrrsh> yo chat do we know when the dreams and nightmares collection is dropping?

[8:25:21] <GiraffePig> So you know, had better days
[8:25:25] <TheSensibleInsane> They aggro the forwardmost placed unit you have
[8:25:33] <TPGfullcore> on wave 10 u what around 10-15 worker
[8:26:11] <TheSensibleInsane> So you want to have 1 strong side where you have most of your force along one wall. Then you want some units on the opposite wall half a square below the other side to split the wave to help with tanking and damage
[8:26:11] <Doccy> wait
[8:26:15] <Doccy> why did i say znf

[8:36:26] <Doccy> NEW GAMBA CHAT
[8:36:29] <Doccy> I AM IN CHARGE NOW
[8:36:31] <Kafkii> Wait what did I do fl0m
[8:36:36] <TheSensibleInsane> Yeah, then you do a tank on the other side of the lane, but half a square down. It will split the wave
[8:37:13] <taito_karasu> is this game worth buying if you never played any TD seriously. asking for a friend ofc
[8:37:17] <BestnoobJC> changed comp
[8:37:21] <BestnoobJC> naice
[8:37:25] <kobraky_> always asking for a friend ofc
[8:38:01] <Doccy> @taito_karasu i mean it depends how seriously you want to take this game. because there game does require some amount of seriousness
[8:38:09] <cjthm> it's closer to an auto battler than a traditional TD imo
[8:38:10] <Doccy> and to get the full bang for your bukc
[8:38:23] <HotDishMan> the first rule of all tower defenses is is your defenses must be symmetrical or patterned... otherwise even if you win you lose.
[8:38:28] <zNfex> tank man
[8:38:30] <Doccy> and get the most content you'd play the harder mods too
[8:38:48] <AstersCreed> maybe getting a little more workers early and letting them leak is ok
[8:38:49] <kobraky_> fuck the starcaller, get the fire lord
[8:38:53] <taito_karasu> damn. ive to many games on my hands to play and was looking for a chill game
[8:38:58] <zNfex> so when did u decide to tell us you're gordon ramsey
[8:39:06] <Kafkii> Anyone remember the tower defense game from pet pet park?
[8:39:11] <Kafkii> that game banged
[8:39:22] <Doccy> like this is fun and chill
[8:39:28] <Doccy> but requires brain

[8:58:47] <Kafkii> As steve harvey once said
[8:58:48] <TheSensibleInsane> Try sending big on wave 6 when you restart. Start saving mythium from like wave 3 and send brutes on wave 6
[8:58:49] <Kafkii> KILL
[8:58:55] <LowRatedHighlander> welp
[8:58:56] <BestnoobJC> alright next gamba

[9:00:03] <Kafkii> this song makes me wanna buy a ford f150
[9:00:13] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKWait
[9:00:19] <TheSensibleInsane> And then do big sends by saving mythium for a few rounds. Brock likes building units with fortified armor type, so any wave with impact damage melts through his towers
[9:00:20] <thafusten> yes so you can do dmg to their king as well

[9:00:46] <Mountie888> i remember the old school starcraft brood war versions of this, just mass marines and build a maze
[9:00:47] <TheSensibleInsane> Due to bigger sends on his vulnurable waves
[9:01:12] <TheSensibleInsane> Yeah, send income and send with wave 6

[9:01:29] <taito_karasu> brb feeding the fat cats
[9:01:30] <TheSensibleInsane> Because Wave 6 is Rockos which are Impact damage and they melt through Brocks tower
[9:02:20] <kobraky_> if youre comp holds, you don't need to upgrade the king
[9:02:44] <TheSensibleInsane> No, it's good to still king up because of income
