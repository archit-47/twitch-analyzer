[0:29:26] <Lucasdeath> below 6k? we need to change it to 10 gifted
[0:29:29] <ElaD_O> wouldn't other streamers that join you need to ask permission from PGL to do the same thing? @fl0m sounded like they gave you specific permission
[0:29:31] <popoaim> !mouse

[0:29:43] <Nightbot> Latest video: fl0m CS:GO PGL Stockholm Major 2021 Pick'Ems - https://youtu.be/KU6j1jyYk4k
[0:29:47] <Dynamo_Dave> damn I need to get a job to buy subs
[0:29:57] <barnumbirr> being below 6k subs is what you get for watching F1 instead of streaming #lazy LUL
[0:29:57] <SikhxStrike> are we gonna be listening to caster as well on your stream?
[0:30:00] <legoooooo_> whoa re u costreaming with
[0:30:05] <siiiif> Dynamo_Dave just take mom's credit card EZ
[0:30:06] <WekePeke> i guess Perez fell off because he didnt get any water after lap 1, seemed veery tired after the race
[0:30:17] <barnumbirr> KEKPOINT
[0:30:19] <WookiePotamus> From a racing stand point the race was kinda meh but from a Strategy stand point the race was crazy
[0:30:29] <Dynamo_Dave> @siiiif I love my mum. I wouldn't do that
[0:30:29] <Justhoohaa> you pugging?
[0:30:31] <Mumflr830> man, any major is better than starladder's KEKW
[0:30:53] <F1niteCS> WookiePotamus YEP disappointing considering how good CoA is for overtaking Sadge
[0:30:59] <SuperGhostGod> fl0m acting like his feelings matter
[0:30:59] <ElaD_O> for sure @mumflr830

[0:31:12] <WookiePotamus> @fl0m ask rich for the NMC overlays KEKW
[0:31:13] <WekePeke> very high tyre wear at cota
[0:31:15] <Mumflr830> @ElaD_O cash cup is better
[0:31:31] <WekePeke> so strategy was very exciting today
[0:31:33] <Dynamo_Dave> fl0m will you still be in control of your ads?

[2:17:29] <mackinS4> Similar feelings about Power Washing Simulator
[2:17:33] <LucidR9> ronaldo was a fucking disgraceful human today, you dont kick a player on the ground even if you "kick the ball" he should be benched for atleast a game or two for that by united. that was fucking horrendous, and even beyond that I had to support a team lead by a player like that. you know how fucking emotionally jarring that is? Speedrulez
[2:17:39] <dweevers> Speedrulez sounds like a fun night
[2:17:40] <SniperRebel23> he dislikes people that act like there in powerwashing sim

[2:19:46] <LucidR9> that being said, absolutely brilliant performance from liverpool
[2:19:48] <Doccy> you bet on something

[2:27:11] <LucidR9> if you judge shit by the outcome then completely fair play could be considered a red
[2:27:11] <bearthorneh> Hey, @fl0m been a couple of monthes since I could catch a stream, how have you been?
[2:27:13] <dweevers> STatisfacti0n texans need to score to cover the spread KEKW
[2:27:16] <fadedspawn> we pee with dominance here bois fl0mH
[2:27:16] <nanotxk> Fl0m just got his ass ate with swing
[2:27:19] <Speedrulez> messyhair heyo 🥔 sister, look i have a special peepo ibpPeepo
[2:27:29] <LucidR9> Speedrulez I am so sorry for MU fans like that
[2:27:29] <zigzagmetal2> fl0m stream :) how is you fl0m and chat?
[2:27:33] <twitchcomrade> @fl0m  hey big man, show me your di*.. oh I mean pick'ems
[2:27:39] <LucidR9> I did not think people would actually ever argue this
[2:27:48] <sh1f0> team mates nappping there
[2:27:50] <marcus7445> I think youre making it out to be worse than it really is. Shit like that happens. Think something like a kick to the head (like we saw in the atl vs liverpool game was way worse)
[2:27:50] <SunnyTater> dick'ems Kreygasm
[2:27:55] <STatisfacti0n> double thanks Pog
[2:27:57] <Speedrulez> LucidR9 brother people will argue everything
[2:28:03] <STatisfacti0n> that means you're double as lucky because fl0m doesn't know how to read
[2:28:05] <fadedspawn> aye 2 thanks Pog
[2:28:08] <LucidR9> marcus7445 this was AFTER play had stopped, AFTER the heat of the moment, ronaldo had ALREADY comitted a foul
[2:28:13] <hunteo18> hi fl0m excited for the major co-streams
[2:28:15] <LucidR9> and then did that, with NO prompting
[2:28:19] <LucidR9> yes
[2:28:26] <marcus7445> @LucidR9 Im arguing the fact that you think anyone should ever apologize for doing something durring a game
[2:28:30] <LucidR9> homie if that's not in the game that's an assault charge
[2:28:32] <dweevers> LucidR9 I wonder if he gets supsended after the match after it
[2:28:32] <Speedrulez> the ronaldo kick
[2:28:36] <dweevers> err suspended
[2:28:38] <Speedrulez> is that what is left of the game

[2:29:32] <sh1f0> it s anti-sport, apart from if alexander got hurt
[2:29:34] <marcus7445> Think the main reason why people are this upset, is because its Ronaldo

[2:30:37] <marcus7445> @LucidR9 Not speaking on your behalf, but i think had it been any other player it would only have had 10% of the attention this is getting
[2:30:39] <v3lvet> what is a NATHANS FAMOUS STRUM ?
[2:30:41] <sh1f0> fl0m word is out ur dick has been growing these days

[2:30:48] <dweevers> WookiePotamus at least you're not a jets or texans fan today?
[2:31:00] <retiiful> hey chat i have a 200 word essay due tomorrow and im watching fl0m please help
[2:31:06] <LucidR9> marcus7445 im not talking about "attention" it's getting, im talking about the responsibility that ronaldo has to control his emotions on the pitch and the team's need to not allow play like that.
[2:31:08] <WookiePotamus> like this somehow feels worse then the browns game
[2:31:19] <retiiful> B R OMEGALUL W N S
[2:31:20] <WookiePotamus> did Nagy somehow take over play calling again?
[2:31:21] <AFugy> don't lay on top of the ball 3Head
[2:31:28] <LucidR9> the play had stopped
[2:31:34] <LucidR9> there was no need to kick the ball
[2:31:37] <2020numbers> spud MmmHmm were good he matched the 5 from the scam train and scammed himslf out of one more that was right after the train MmmHmm fl0mSmorting

[2:32:41] <LucidR9> marcus7445 your idea that what players do on the pitch should be "Just on the pitch" doesnt work for me - I've watched rugby since I was very young and have seen people follow that same mentality, I have seen my childhood hero literally get punched 8 times in the face on a pitch and the perpatrator was suspended for 3 months, no criminal charges, nothing
[2:33:01] <LucidR9> its an extremely dangerous precedent to set that it's "part of the game"

[3:47:37] <theBaboda> BozzyRL for my school it depends on the game. like CS we play in the normal bracket for teams and stuff but also play a lot of college teams, but for OW we can't play in anything other than like scrims against other people
[3:48:12] <beerocl0ck> fl0m those recyclers work by exchanging lower tier for higher. so that green band would have cost you 3 white items. the reds cost 5 green items
[3:48:12] <BozzyRL> @theBaboda I gotcha. Yeah thats interesting. I hadnt heard of that before
[3:48:56] <theBaboda> its honetly super cool because i can also get scholarships for it too Peepo @BozzyRL
[3:49:08] <Indoorguitar> @fl0m this party sucks wheres the tiddy
[3:49:23] <theBaboda> but also it's super scuffed because the school doesn't put alot of trust in us Peepo
[3:49:48] <ZaeThrix> Is this fortn8 LUL
[3:49:56] <D1srvpts> BozzyRL players also get the prize pools for all the tourneys and a new league just started up for some colleges with quite a large pool so some people pay their college with the prize money
[3:50:07] <D1srvpts> it's pretty sick
[3:50:20] <BozzyRL> @theBaboda Yeah its crazy to see how far esports has come. I still remember the Halo 2/3 MLG days.
