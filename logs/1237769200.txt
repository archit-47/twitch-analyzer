[0:47:09] <hobrev> it was legit garbage :D
[0:47:09] <weeeegy> -dust2 -mirage +office +assault. i fixed csgo.
[0:47:11] <leon_420_> widepeepo TouchGrass
[0:47:14] <mbie1sa> bold idea : merge D2 and Mirage into Dust3
[0:47:16] <Archit47> its just overplayed
[0:47:19] <mukulhayaran> widepeepo TouchGrass
[0:47:20] <mukasi30> inferno is good
[0:47:21] <steelarm77> @fl0m your fav map in the pool rn?
[0:47:21] <Archit47> and thats the only reason I hate mirage

[0:47:25] <logistic333> hmm vitality comeback?
[0:47:26] <b0btheman_> 8 - 7?
[0:47:26] <slb_> @weeeegy assault Kreygasm
[0:47:30] <TLsmf> map is just shit they should get it out and make us happy ez solution.
[0:47:32] <johnclanes> Bro assault back in the day was fun af, autosnipers were a bit byusted
[0:47:33] <olong_> INFERNO is a great map
[0:47:35] <johnclanes> But it was fun af
[0:47:35] <vortrx7> Inferno the best
[0:47:35] <caraigggg> so basically u prefer to play mirage than dust 2 ok got it
[0:47:36] <k1r1to_kun_> do vitality comeback? @fl0m
[0:47:40] <evilvillain> I would prefer train over d2
[0:47:46] <TLsmf> inferno >>>>>>>>>>
[0:47:47] <Sun__House> wow moses how about we simplify that fraction
[0:47:47] <MagicMarker1> Bring back cobble, cache and season Kreygasm

[0:47:53] <weeeegy> bro 1.6 assault was the shit.
[0:47:54] <Noblew36> Inferno best map in pro play. Change my mind
[0:47:55] <warrior__ftw> they need to put anubis in
[0:47:57] <b0btheman_> true
[0:47:58] <jockst3r> @fl0m any more news on tuscan?
[0:47:58] <cottyboy23> I miss cobble
[0:47:59] <F1niteCS> fl0mJam
[0:48:00] <bluewolf2303> D2 is life
[0:48:01] <Bolly> I don't see why people want to replace Dust2 and Mirage with the same worn out maps we've already had. It doesn't fix the problem
[0:48:03] <caraigggg> Yea saw it KEKW
[0:48:04] <steelarm77> @fl0m your fav map in the pool rn? Û†ÄÄ
[0:48:07] <raulito_cuh> So then what‚Äôs the best map then?
[0:48:10] <shurenji> u think inferno is better than mirage?
[0:48:20] <Sealer9> yeah i banned vert over d2 last night bc i gave into team peer pressure and immeditly regretted it lol
[0:48:21] <ghoust_rider_> Dust 2 is just overplayed
[0:48:22] <justT1LT> KEKW
[0:48:23] <WookiePotamus> Add season fl0mSlam
[0:48:24] <Madfish2021> 8-7 comeback?
[0:48:25] <slb_> @Bolly +dust2 +season
[0:48:27] <EazyyNY> those dignitas holos are so beautiful
[0:48:33] <n0r13k> valve aren't going to change dust2 beyond this because the entire cis region is dependent on it in MM
[0:48:34] <slb_> @Bolly -dust ofc
[0:48:36] <olong_> D:
[0:48:46] <justT1LT> mir inf d2 ResidentSleeper
[0:48:48] <johnclanes> a is impossible to retake on inferno
[0:48:49] <Bolly> @slb_ two copies of Dust2 in the map pool HYPERNODDERS
[0:48:51] <johnclanes> So annoying
[0:48:54] <angadsingh21> A site hardest to retake
[0:49:02] <ayykennay> inferno is super grindy / utility based which can get tiring
[0:49:05] <slb_> !1deag
[0:49:05] <kuroyasha_ryu1> inferno gives the best clutches tho
[0:49:06] <Nightbot> slb_ pops a 1deag on ms00769171 1TAP
[0:49:08] <caraigggg> Vertigo gang where yall at?!
[0:49:09] <BobL0ss> So what do you like... @fl0m
[0:49:10] <evilvillain> retakes are rough and econ so important on inferno
[0:49:12] <thefranknbeanz> Zywoo not fat anymore Pog
[0:49:12] <YanEM> Make Arch bigger?
[0:49:14] <jockst3r> overpass best map change my mind
[0:49:18] <justT1LT> longer banana gachiBASS
[0:49:20] <angadsingh21> B site D2 also very hard to retake
[0:49:21] <ghoust_rider_> @fl0m Every OverPass game is the same do you agree?
[0:49:22] <13eeasy> we need longer banana
[0:49:25] <weeeegy> fl0m you make my banana longer
[0:49:26] <shurenji> i think banana is the biggest problem in inferno
[0:49:26] <SupraUK_> bring back the arches in banana fl0mSlam
[0:49:28] <stormshitman> i hate playing inferno more than dust 2 but dust 2 is shitter than inferno
[0:49:31] <TLsmf> why did shox throw that smoke?
[0:49:35] <johnclanes> I think make moto wider so 1 smoke cant completely block everyone out from arch, thoughts @fl0m ?

[0:51:14] <Paroto7> overpass is the best overall . nuke is the best for organized team play not MM @fl0m
[0:51:19] <BeauxGnar> HAROOOOSH
[0:51:20] <ZephCutie> Cache and cobble should come back take out vertigo and ancient
[0:51:22] <caraigggg> nt
[0:51:24] <Archit47> justT1LT sure
[0:51:28] <stormshitman> nothing zywoo can do there

[0:52:13] <a732v> its like old Vertigo
[0:52:14] <justT1LT> i mean any EU would be fine right? if theyre willing
[0:52:17] <shurenji> @fl0m have u ever tried valorant?
[0:52:17] <getritch> sucks playing casually but fracture should be unique af for pros at least
[0:52:20] <uutkarsh> @Archit47 PauseFish
[0:52:23] <DIkktudo> do you like ancient?
[0:52:24] <weeeegy> icebox 2020 is played the same as now.
[0:52:26] <Archit47> justT1LT but the ping
[0:52:26] <DrIsaac> is Icebox the map with a shitty A site thats tough to hold as defense?
[0:52:29] <jcollar23> @fl0m Do you miss Cache?
[0:52:30] <easternexamination> tbh it feels like every valorant map is like that
[0:52:33] <ceesidd> yeah that map is shit, teams get punished for trying anything new on Icebox
[0:52:34] <k1r1to_kun_> should cs try 3 bombsites @fl0m ?
[0:52:40] <KhaaanUK> In Champions teams had different execs as counter strats to the meta
[0:52:41] <Archit47> uutkarsh wait u wanna play
[0:52:42] <Spudack> what do you think about the like "retake meta"
[0:52:42] <TriPawedBork> Isn't Valorant in general just incredibly flowcharty?
[0:52:42] <steelarm77> @DrIsaac yes KEKW
[0:52:43] <justT1LT> Archit47 yeah thats why i said "if theyre willing"
[0:52:45] <YanEM> @fl0m have you tried to make an own map yet? Might be fun content.
[0:52:48] <njgyaani> why there are all girls in twitch hype train ad

[0:52:56] <justT1LT> mukulhayaran PauseFish
[0:52:57] <purpleslinky7> do you think they will ever add tuscan to competitive?
[0:53:09] <STatisfacti0n> @k1r1to_kun_ no
[0:53:16] <uutkarsh> @Archit47 noo man i cant, dont have a good pc and internet Sadge
[0:53:19] <siDDziy> Navi gonna win this
[0:53:20] <jockst3r> and that sentence is why I dislike playing valorant
[0:53:20] <DrIsaac> @steelarm77 god i fucking hated playing that map KEKW
[0:53:27] <Noblew36> The problem with valorant is that there are no ‚Äúgood‚Äù maps. The best ones are ok at best.
[0:53:28] <justT1LT> uutkarsh Sadge
[0:53:34] <BSODslayer> As someone who watches quite a lot of CS, but doesn't play, I'd probably put Nuke, Overpass and, depending on the teams playing, Inferno as my favourites from a viewer's perspective. Oh, and D2 and Vertigo can have a slap-fight for last place. Eurgh.
[0:53:35] <Archit47> uutkarsh well you have internet since u are here but maybe not pc
[0:53:37] <uutkarsh> justT1LT FEelsBadMan
[0:53:42] <weeeegy> valorant removed the randomness of spawn timings and put randomness in the gunplay LUL
[0:53:43] <Archit47> Sadge either way
[0:53:44] <Cbake987> Winner of this plays gambit in the finals yeah??
[0:53:46] <mukulhayaran> @justt1lt can't play rn Sadge dinner time

[0:54:18] <SlamDeath> @BSODslayer 100% agreed, and if inferno's a balanced match it's an amazing 3rd map
[0:54:18] <uutkarsh> siDDziy Pune
[0:54:21] <GamblinFish> How would you feel about going to a larger map pool instead of just swapping maps out?
[0:54:21] <Spudack> idk when i play valorant i feel like no matter what map i get i always dread it a little but also i play it everyday so
[0:54:24] <Gour204> winner of this plays again right after?
[0:54:26] <justT1LT> mukulhayaran is oke, we here to have fun anyway
[0:54:29] <nahitsmedical> its my favorite map rn and I have no shame
[0:54:31] <siDDziy> @uutkarsh wtf lol me too
[0:54:33] <angadsingh21> FPS drop in ancient
[0:54:33] <sharkey3322> Not like trash Vertigo LUL
[0:54:35] <n0r13k> how about a gate that drops down 15 seconds into the round at mid on dust2
[0:54:35] <DrIsaac> Ancient is a good map I agree. You need to play it to get used to it so most play once and never go back. Its sad.
[0:54:39] <njgyaani> the only game i m bad at is csgo valo dota mario gta fortnite cod halo
[0:54:39] <uutkarsh> siDDziy ayyy POGGERS
[0:54:46] <raulito_cuh> Offer two corridors into B tunnel
[0:54:46] <Spudack> what about fracture @fl0m Kappa
[0:54:46] <magics1001> Looks like Vit going home :D
[0:54:47] <jockst3r> ancient is a good map but I still think they need to change somethings on it...like visability and some of the walls/floors so its easier with nades
[0:54:50] <baseplate93> ancient is new dust 2 for me
[0:54:57] <SupraUK_> fl0m hear me out... - lower tunnels + connect top mid and outside tunnels
[0:55:00] <Humb1edore> I miss Anubis
[0:55:08] <mukulhayaran> @justt1lt whisper your steam so I can add you? PauseFish
[0:55:13] <DrIsaac> @baseplate93 dust2 is the bane of my existence in map picks. just such a boring map to play
[0:55:16] <Dodidor> i wish it was simpler to plant on a
[0:55:17] <DrIsaac> imo
[0:55:17] <justT1LT> mukulhayaran sure
[0:55:19] <Semiproshark7> Ancient pugs just feel so bad, I can deal with nuke and vertigo pugs
[0:55:19] <lonewolf65ate> did Navi win map 1?
[0:55:19] <angadsingh21> @Humb1edore huge map loved it
[0:55:21] <n0r13k> how about putting office into the map pool?
[0:55:22] <YanEM> @fl0m maybe pugging-systems like faceit should give extra-rewards to play new maps when they come out^^
[0:55:24] <sharkey3322> Isnt that CS?

[0:56:03] <jowen27> that was the case on split and thats why they made alot of angled parts in split @fl0m
[0:56:03] <r2d2__0> do you think that valorant will ever release a replay system? within the next 6months?

[0:56:58] <Gour204> just a bit to much going on in places that dont have direct impact just slows the play down

[0:57:13] <Humb1edore> Replace dust2 with Anubis
[0:57:23] <BSODslayer> @slamdeath Yeah - from my admittedly gameplay-ignorant viewer perspective, Inferno feels like it works so well as a 3rd exactly because it's "a bit more plain" than the rest; less flashy/gimmicky, more "optimised" for revealing the tiny differences between good teams and players and >great< ones.
[0:57:26] <sylveonkid1> do you think valorant would benefit from a fpl type of keague?
[0:57:31] <s1mply_ant> I fucking hate new dust 2, poor vitality

[1:29:16] <TheLeviathong> I just think there's such a huge gap between Navi and the rest that they looked really great at IEM Winter comparatively
[1:29:17] <weeeegy> is apex leaving?
[1:29:20] <Dynamo_Dave> @dotalegendery2 then I'm just dumb
[1:29:28] <dims_cs> oh come on, vitality had so many chances to beat navi and they never crossed the finish line, how much of zywoo's prime do you want them to waste?
[1:29:29] <EINacho> thing is that they probably worked out the deal right before the major when vitality wasn't doing as well
[1:29:30] <Treefi> @weeeegy no
[1:29:32] <gmor_> i agree with that @fl0m, vitality are still a top 3 team right now i think, it everything works in their favor
[1:29:33] <5Rule_> whr will apex go?
[1:29:33] <kian_dn> @weeeegy it s not likely

[3:26:06] <s1mply_ant> Gambit T side will make or break
[3:26:07] <MANIKcc> unless it's summertime Actually then get tanktops and shorts

[3:52:20] <jeevesses> Gambit have all 5 really talented individuals unlike vitality being 1 man
[3:52:20] <bigbuddypal> its not good for the game if we have another astralis-like era where one team just wins everything, imo

[3:54:03] <dasfuzion> @dasfuzion looks at his lips and u find out LOL
[3:54:03] <edgyeddy233> they prepared specifically for navi
[3:54:03] <s1mply_ant> stealing map pick is a real slap to the tiddies

[4:40:24] <MANIKcc> he has to reel launders back in LUL
[4:40:25] <s1mply_ant> I had taken some major L's by the point lmfao Lau

[4:40:39] <unicorns____> %? 69
[4:40:39] <Nightbot> Joris says 38%
[4:40:41] <DashX239> I still think it's post major blues just from having such a good time and missing it
[4:40:41] <Dodidor> simple was literally the highest rated player before the final
[4:40:43] <jck961> simple single-handedly took down g2
[4:40:46] <alexis809s> the last 2 matches he destroy everyone
[4:40:46] <jrol4> Who‚Äôs going to awp for liquid?
[4:40:47] <aunathons> navi havent gotten rifles
[4:40:47] <blackcat64> i think ppl just expect navi to play how they played at the major which was insane
[4:40:52] <STatisfacti0n> navi as a whole has been a bit more up and down this tournament
[4:40:55] <tehgin> oh no, s1mple isn't an absolute god, he's just a demi-god
[4:40:55] <evilgardener1> is he full simple or just great

[4:41:00] <ghoust_rider_> @fl0m s1mple fully bought on an eco. Do you think it's an emotional buy?
[4:41:01] <BSODslayer> With the "right" glasses, Anders could pull off an AMAZING "late 70s Unix legendary programmer" look LUL
[4:41:03] <notchiee> @aunathons they have 4 rifles
[4:41:04] <audio_noodle> @fl0m i think it's mostly just, that bit has offloaded some of the "starplayer" thing off of him, so he can dick around a lot more lol
[4:41:06] <whitechocolate64> s1mple has a 1.37 rating this tourney lmao
[4:41:08] <Sealer9> osee @jrol4

[4:43:02] <Sealer9> no hes not. hes a robot
[4:43:02] <bober040> yea boy
[4:43:04] <BonBonVal> wdym, its unrealistic to expect him to win every single match and engagement?
[4:43:04] <ghoust_rider_> Nice
[4:43:07] <ShmetRT66> bruh
[4:43:07] <jeevesses> S1mple became s0mple then s1mple
[4:43:09] <worthwatching> imagine simple and stewie together
[4:43:11] <s1mply_ant> caught in 4K
[4:43:12] <worthwatching> would be beast
[4:43:16] <random_factz> SupraUK_ FACT checked it
[4:43:16] <Sirius_0069> KEKW
[4:43:16] <STatisfacti0n> that angle is so wonky
[4:43:18] <welhaithere> the thing is he somehow meets those expectations one way or another
[4:43:20] <audio_noodle> caught in 16k
[4:43:23] <grannyz_tuna> souvenir gold ak fk clean
[4:43:24] <Boier96> ye we have unrealistic expectations on s1mple but he lives up to them
[4:43:24] <Archie2> what a position from s1mple
[4:43:25] <Archie2> wow
[4:43:28] <misha123abc> you think s1mple will fall off anytime soon? @flomf
[4:43:36] <huronvalley21> gambit getting 6 will be good
[4:43:36] <audio_noodle> @fl0m i think simple heard chatters doubting him
[4:43:39] <Roya1tyCS> I love Hobbits AK with the crown stickers
[4:43:39] <lategamer3> how did he get there
[4:43:39] <percnowitzki040> was that a community reference?
[4:43:40] <BonBonVal> fl0mf
[4:43:50] <ig5mindhacker> true that KEKW
[4:43:52] <tehgin> he pushed mid
[4:43:55] <tehgin> that's how he got there
[4:44:02] <mdrdGaming> s1mple with 1.20 rating is already subpar for his standards
[4:44:02] <gambinium> Personally, am sad he didn't get 1.36 rating this year
[4:44:02] <silviu_cs> s1mple is like the Ukranian fl0m, it's crazy
[4:44:05] <Zorik13> 1,2 hltv rating? you realy droped the ball there, s1mple
[4:44:07] <Stogie6> I mean, expectations are based on past performance so really he's put those expectations on himself fl0m
[4:44:11] <Nate_DogeTV> @percnowitzki040 yes
[4:44:16] <threatlevelmichael> not even 30 kills, kinda washed tbh YEP
[4:44:16] <l3ordon> I feel like NiKo can perform just as well, but he isn't expected to
[4:44:17] <huronvalley21> who's the best rifler ax1le out niko?
[4:44:18] <alexis809s> the thing is he always goes above expectations
[4:44:21] <stormshitman> s1mple is legit pissed now i think after that round where he threw the hand warmer with what he said
[4:44:22] <iam_DJ_> the fact that he always delivers on high standards is crazy
[4:44:24] <Sealer9> need lunch but don't feel like driving man someoene bring me food
[4:44:27] <audio_noodle> s1mple somehow has larger nuts than hobbit
[4:44:30] <som2999> swap boomitch with hampus Navi would be unstoppable
[4:44:31] <Kaervas86> drinking coke
[4:44:33] <tehgin> not even a 1.4 rating this tournament smh Kappa
[4:44:35] <RemedysHD> it was like NIKO on mouzsports a few years back
[4:44:41] <BonBonVal> i expect s1mple to get 16 aces EZ
[4:44:42] <Madfish2021> even when navi lose he still delivers
[4:44:45] <Kaervas86> pepsi is better
[4:44:50] <jeevesses> The diehard s1mple stans are giving everyone brain damage rn
[4:44:51] <jlcrellin> @som2999 language barrier
[4:44:52] <masterchickenx5> not getting a 30 bomb is underperformed for s1mple
[4:44:53] <gambit_val> inters cok
[4:44:57] <XAND3R__> @fl0m the digital vibrance on the stream makes it so hard to watch. Its so RED
[4:44:57] <Archie2> do you think s1mple has reached his full ceiling or do you think there's still room for him @fl0m

[4:45:14] <JxFriz> S1mple not above a 1.4 rating that most players can only dream of having over 1 tournament in their career? Hes underperforming

[4:48:48] <ItsAho> Wasnt he number 2 after zywoo in 2019 with guardian on awp?
[4:48:50] <s1mply_ant> Niko best without question

[4:48:57] <Sealer9> if you say anyone other than niko it shows u haven't watched cs the last year
[4:48:58] <XeeVzz> He rifled in 2019
[4:48:58] <edgyeddy233> You put b1t top 10 riflers @fl0m?
[4:48:59] <Lordwen> niko is kinda bad, just low sens abuser makes the stats
[4:49:00] <Boier96> niko is definitely number 1 rifler right no
[4:49:00] <KodaRG> @xmarcus2001x chill homie, nobody is saying hes bad rifler, but he wouldn't be the best
[4:49:02] <Justhoohaa> STatisfacti0n stayed up all night camping a notorious monster that still hasnt popped
[4:49:03] <jonttu877> more like top 5 if he only concentrated on rifling he would become even better rifler
[4:49:04] <ghoust_rider_> Hot takes
[4:49:09] <BonBonVal> niko.,... b1t might take the spot

[4:49:11] <beefnozzle> ive only been watching cs for a year, is this NiKo peak better thank his mouse/faze peak years?
[4:49:12] <ShmetRT66> not too comparable
[4:49:12] <jeevesses> NiKo is undisputed Rifler goat
[4:49:18] <mdrdGaming> he rifled in 2019, still number 2
[4:49:19] <alexis809s> that is a hard question
[4:49:22] <s1mply_ant> its not comparable, require different things
[4:49:24] <Roya1tyCS> I didn‚Äôt watch cs when kennys was dominant but was he better than s1mple is now at awping
[4:49:25] <future_synthwave> @fl0m have you played against niko?
[4:49:28] <jlcrellin> they said he had good stats last game with no awp or something
[4:49:29] <eldrago125> rifling isn't one hit kill
[4:49:33] <pexzy09> !fl0m without beardpicture pls
[4:49:33] <atsteak> awp is more punishing, 1 chance to kill

[4:49:42] <BSODslayer> AWP'ing feels more like it's "on your own terms", if that makes any sense..?
[4:49:45] <billballbowl> yeah cause the awp is fundamentally broken

[4:50:05] <TestTubeBaba> b1t Holy Shit
[4:50:09] <future_synthwave> @fl0m have you played against niko?
[4:50:12] <td_gg> who are your top 3 riflers for 2021

[4:50:14] <lategamer3> B1T has also entered the chat
[4:50:16] <yu__ng> is that a joke? shurenji
[4:50:16] <l3ordon> Speaking from my SEM rank, I think the AWP is better Peepo
[4:50:17] <Dodidor> simple would be at worst top 4 in the world with rifle, in 2017 he was a rifler and worse and was stil ranked 8 and was ranked too low that year too

[4:54:28] <Achapman18> did hobbit even see him
[4:54:28] <jeevesses> @kodarg that‚Äôs what makes things overrated
[4:54:32] <Dodidor> hs percentage is a fun stat

[4:54:33] <balboflow> resepct
[4:54:34] <alexis809s> except for Bit
[4:54:40] <itWyrm> its a cosmetic stat
[4:54:46] <easternexamination> It's a meme stat
[4:54:46] <MagicMarker1> all about that adr
[4:54:47] <Roya1tyCS> My average headshot is like 55-69
[4:54:54] <long_hands_02> I think twistzz has the highest ever in a year right?
[4:54:56] <AFugy> a lot of head shots come from the second round
[4:54:57] <KaptenKlaenning> i always have high hs % since i can't kill anyone any other way
[4:54:57] <KodaRG> @jeevesses ehhh, overrated to me is a player who doesn't do good, but is loved and hyped up and said to do good
[4:55:01] <edgyeddy233> gambit about to ruin b1t's tournament win %
[4:55:02] <barnumbirr> worthless STat? KEKW
[4:55:04] <STatisfacti0n> I use it to kinda monitor my xhair placement. when my xhair placement is good my HS% goes up

[4:55:18] <STatisfacti0n> but I'm pretty consistently at around 44-50% HS

[4:55:23] <lategamer3> lets go gambit PogChamp PogChamp
[4:55:25] <edilarin> you should always kill with style
[4:55:26] <MANIKcc> bro 1 kill, 100% hs, best player ez
[4:55:27] <s1mply_ant> 5-19 with 100% headshot rating is still shit
[4:55:28] <ghoust_rider_> they got 5 rounds monkaS
[4:55:30] <apoodle10> hs% is more a stat to brag, not to evaluate performance
[4:55:31] <bestestbeeko> good for overwatch videos
[4:55:35] <jeevesses> @siddziy welcome to real life where numbers don‚Äôt match eye test KEKW
[4:55:36] <beefnozzle> i see niko constantly checking his hs % on streams
[4:55:36] <Dameey_> i think it's just the implication that hs = fast kill, which is absolutely true in b1t's case

[4:55:41] <l3ordon> KD and Headshot % more important than ADR and impact, cant prove me wrong Peepo
[4:55:48] <Roya1tyCS> Wonder if someone has like 42 kills with 100% lol. Probably never has happened or ever will
[4:55:49] <misha123abc> nah niko has 50
[4:55:49] <sneakyhank> @fl0m how many t rounds is enough?
[4:55:52] <valar1003> if I get my first kill with hs, I never shoot again in the game COPIUM
[4:55:57] <Nightbot> MERCH DROP IS LIVE fl0mstore.com
[4:56:01] <Archie2> I won an mm game with like 30 something kills and the guy on the other team said work on hs% KEKW
[4:56:02] <nahitsmedical> but not really you could whiff the first 15 shots lol
[4:56:03] <silviu_cs> NiKo also AWPs sometimes
[4:56:08] <Dameey_> at a pro level i mean

[4:56:09] <stormshitman> @Roya1tyCS cheater go brrr
[4:56:12] <Zorik13> @l1tb0i wdym. NiKo has 50 percent hs
[4:56:14] <BSODslayer> It's a stat that's almost exclusively relevant to talk about in relation to other specific role/position/etc-stats, IMO...
[4:56:14] <beefnozzle> HLTV says he niko has 52% hs
[4:56:15] <vtec_kicked_in__yo> no way he has 30%
[4:56:20] <F1rstcontact> I hope s1mple get the MVP award
[4:56:21] <misha123abc> s1mple has 40% hs
[4:56:26] <apoodle10> a high hs% can just mean that you're a god on pistol and then don't do anything but get some lucky headshots the rest of the game
[4:56:28] <l1tb0i> Ya heard it last time they were analyzing g2 this tourney, basically pointing out to fans that he just takes EVERY duel
[4:56:28] <chrisp_baykon> what is that smoke
[4:56:29] <loldia1337> nobody's gonna come near scream's 68% anyway so why care
[4:56:30] <nikollaaa> smoke?
[4:56:32] <marathon_fish> but fl0m why use many bullets when one does job
[4:56:33] <hwanzi> @fl0m u use the curved monitor????
[4:56:34] <akhileshjatti> 3 man cast?
[4:56:37] <luckinout1> you can wiff 29 shots and still get a hs
[4:56:38] <chrisp_baykon> smoke? modcheck?
[4:56:39] <l3ordon> WHo has the highest HS %?
[4:56:40] <whitechocolate64> loldia1337 b1t is higher lmao
[4:56:46] <vtec_kicked_in__yo> hs % doesn't matter for awpers
[4:56:47] <blackx_18> s1mple is bad because he only has 40hs percentage :)
[4:56:47] <beefnozzle> @l3ordon scream had it
[4:56:50] <STatisfacti0n> @fl0m but for a rifler, if your xhair placement is good typically you're HS% is gonna be somewhat higher yeah? I mean there's a lot of variables and shouldn't be a PRIMARY stat but it can be an indication
[4:56:51] <l1tb0i> I was talking this tournament
[4:56:52] <SAMURAI1011> Is this the last match ???
[4:56:52] <siDDziy> what was screams edshot percentage?
[4:56:54] <l1tb0i> I believe

[4:56:56] <DreamzTeeVee> @apoodle10 I'm in this comment and I don't like it
[4:56:57] <long_hands_02> Niko is a team destroyer.... whener he plays with a new roster his teammates to bad while he plays extremely good... if it happens every time there is a reason behind it
[4:57:08] <hwanzi> @f0m u should check out the ASUS ROG Strix XG27AQM its insane
[4:57:09] <jetrae55> once people start to get their spray under control HS% seems to matter less. In like silver & nova lobbies HS% matters more because no one can consistantly spray
[4:57:11] <ShmetRT66> fl0m got them curvy thangs

[4:57:46] <KodaRG> @jetrae55 yeah i noticed that even with me, I have pretty bad spray but my crosshair placement and burst is pretty solid

[4:57:54] <stormshitman> navi need 10-5 and pistol and the 2 rounds to follow
[4:57:54] <alexis809s> @huronvalley21 No way Pog
[4:57:56] <tehgin> time to damage/kill is way better than HS%
[4:57:58] <Sealer9> controlling ak spray hardest thing on the planet

[4:58:22] <billcypher28> @fl0m y r so many pros using the nomad knife KEKW it's ugly, respectfully @fl0m
[4:58:22] <deagstra> curve makes more sense with bigger monitors
[4:58:24] <ceesidd> valorant just counts total headshots, whereas the % is kills that had at least one hs
[4:58:24] <s1mply_ant> Same, its really just a cool thing to say you have
[4:58:26] <Madfish2021> I have a curved monitor and im still dogshit
[4:58:26] <j1mmynes> if you use a curved monitor your throwing
[4:58:26] <evilvillain> still can't believe bit still runs m4a4
[4:58:27] <BooomerNinja> Movies are better on the curve for sure
[4:58:27] <Alkahzane> curve is crucial on 34, 38 and 49 inch monitors
[4:58:35] <F1rstcontact> I have a curved Monitor and hinestly i dont see a point in buying that.
[4:58:37] <future_synthwave> @l3ordon @TheRock_as valorant calculates how many % of your bullets shot are HS, cs calculates how much of your kills are hs
[4:58:37] <Archie2> @fl0m keyboard recommendations?
[4:58:38] <s1mply_ant> doesnt really add anything for me either
[4:58:38] <edilarin> a4 for the win :D
[4:58:38] <MANIKcc> I have both curved and not, it's easier to adjust to curved than to leave curved to flat for my eyes
[4:58:45] <rewatgg> lol
[4:58:48] <shurenji> do you think there's a huge difference between 144h and 240h monitor? @fl0m

[5:34:34] <Cadet_Caribou> How can they team afford that???
[5:34:36] <itPat> lower lever players that teams could actually use just cant get picked up because absurd buy outs
[5:34:36] <xAstranaut> a lot of younger players signed to orgs in Valorant without lawyers and got shit deals it feels like... now they're stuck in a contract
[5:34:38] <mArcusX87> I think what you do for the cs community is huge I have told you this before @fl0m you do your thing for more than money you do it because it‚Äôs not a job for you and your passion shows through so many players from the community rely on your streams on a daily basis and without fail you are there every day fl0m I think you should be inducted in to the hall of fame of CSGO if you haven‚Äôt been already!!

[6:16:29] <LucidR9> and obviously, the OLED screen KodaRG
[6:16:31] <llchisenll> It doesn't feel right that people have so high hopes for m0nesy
[6:16:34] <STatisfacti0n> I'm older than s1mple but I wouldn't mind being baby s1mple
[6:16:38] <stormshitman> i agree in that i mean in the context of how good they are and what it entails to be mini s1mple
[6:16:39] <LucidR9> how much better does the screen look KodaRG HmmNotes
[6:16:41] <TheAuditorTV> @LucidR9 im hoping to get brilliant diamond for christmas

[6:17:57] <shiba_91> electronic was underrated before major imo
[6:17:59] <alexis809s> he is perfectly rated KEKW
[6:17:59] <Holmessssssss> if navi when this tourney where does this year rank in terms of best single year in CSGO history
[6:17:59] <TheRock_as> he DID just get support of the year

[6:18:10] <TheAuditorTV> @LucidR9 dude i hated megas KEKW
[6:18:11] <future_jason> perfecto has become a top tier clutcher
[6:18:11] <YanEM> everyone thinks EVERYONE is good on NAVI to be fair ;D
[6:18:14] <hmminator> @fl0m bomage can be a bad link for navi
[6:18:14] <JustVinny_> simple literally called him a genius
[6:18:15] <LucidR9> you hated megas?
[6:18:15] <tkglog> THOSE ARE BOOMBL4S SAND BAGS HE WILL DEFEND WITH HIS LIFE
[6:18:19] <ethanokp> electronic was never underrated
[6:18:19] <LucidR9> I think megas were really interesting
[6:18:23] <ananas197> hey man ‚úåÔ∏è
[6:18:28] <numb3r_cs> KEKW
[6:18:30] <LucidR9> right hand of the king I thought? when did we gradute to God?
[6:18:31] <LucidR9> OMEGALOOL
[6:18:33] <cloutburstgg> which team in your opinion is the best inferno team rn? @fl0m
[6:18:39] <SandwichSundays> electronic is amazing
[6:18:40] <blackcat64> the only reason why electronic isnt talked about more is cuz s1mple
[6:18:41] <amg_seuseo> Hobbit is the most consistent Gambit player in GO
[6:18:41] <ChamposaurusWrex> s1mple is underrated too
[6:18:45] <ChamposaurusWrex> Kappa
[6:18:45] <LucidR9> he aint A god he's THE god
[6:18:48] <LucidR9> this game is monotheistic

[6:18:51] <klaadem> is it ignorant to think that perfecto is worse than the rest of the team?
[6:18:58] <pzode> in electronic's first half a year in Na'Vi I personally think he was more impactful than s1mple. he dropped off a lot online but he's back with LAN baby
[6:19:00] <future_jason> s1mple is Exodia but electronic is dark magician girl Kappa
[6:19:01] <marathon_fish> @fl0m now that its been in the game a few months, how do you feel about droppable nades?
[6:19:02] <abp__> boombl is good
[6:19:04] <evilvillain> b1t might come for the right hand of the king
[6:19:05] <ajeverett9> Is b1t the left hand now ?

[6:19:27] <ethanokp> nafany stressin
[6:19:28] <Archie2> he's that support player that gets overlooked
[6:19:31] <BSODslayer> 10-5 or Gambit's completely fucked, right..?
[6:19:39] <luketheduke012> Will S1mple get MVP for this event as well
[6:19:39] <boongaard> perfecto is the clutch player right?
[6:19:39] <sjoerdtheman> navi is actually insane individually
[6:19:40] <Chumbo767> They are very good at what they do
[6:19:40] <tkglog> what are all the roles for Navi
[6:19:40] <kobraky_> @Kafkii  against TL, he didnt
[6:19:40] <LucidR9> dynamax definitely feels more balanced than mega tho @TheAuditorTV
[6:19:43] <mdrdGaming> perfecto is the passive player in navi. boom was able to play like that in banana bec of perfecto
[6:19:45] <BSODslayer> Even more than they already are, obvs LUL
[6:19:45] <Archie2> navi isn't as good without perfecto
[6:19:51] <NebChilly> electronic was important to navi before simple even got there
[6:19:51] <samsara_c> Where did boom come from?
[6:19:52] <liliplatsch> dont forget boomi is king of banana
[6:19:53] <styx_bulldoq> styx_bulldoq subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 95 months, currently on a 95 month streak!

[6:20:03] <arjunracing> navi isnt as good without navi
[6:20:05] <SenpaiKayKayy> perfect o would be a star in almost every other team
[6:20:06] <LucidR9> also sjoerdtheman getting breath of the wild when BOTW 2 comes out in january might be a mistake OMEGALOOL
[6:20:06] <alexis809s> roles are perfect in this roster NODDERS
[6:20:06] <xExoCeph> is it just me or IGL's in general are the kinda weakest individually in their teams
[6:20:07] <owpog> would peak astralis win vs navi @fl0m
[6:20:11] <djues333> bulldoq Pog
[6:20:12] <evilvillain> definitely no weak links on this navi unit its scary moving forward for the remainder of the scene especially with the rosters moves about to happen
[6:20:14] <ChamposaurusWrex> navi isnt that good if you take away boombl4, s1mple, b1t, electronic, and perfecto
[6:20:17] <TheAuditorTV> @LucidR9 from what ive seen its the same as the og with different evolution requirements
[6:20:22] <kobraky_> @fl0m  he may be king of banana, but against TL he didn't perform
[6:20:22] <MANIKcc> 95 Pog
[6:20:23] <valar1003> who's the best support player for last 5 yrs? for me it's xyp @fl0m
[6:20:27] <YanEM> Friberg would be proud^^
[6:20:29] <sjoerdtheman> just finish it in 1 day LucidR9
[6:20:31] <BSODslayer> @arjunracing Are... Are you OK? Can you smell burning?

[6:29:50] <vtec_kicked_in__yo> YEP
[6:29:50] <logistic333> NAVI BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD POGGERS
[6:29:51] <kono_dio_da_4> @fl0m simple kills 2-3 almost every pistol round KEKW
[6:29:51] <Zorik13> s1mple's p250 is like 20% buf to pistol win percentage
[6:29:52] <STatisfacti0n> @LucidR9 yeah I think so. even when astralis had their era, they still dropped out of a couple of tournaments I believe
[6:29:52] <tahawus> old astralis losing pistols and still winning
[6:30:00] <AFugy> they just imagine they're play mythic in the pistol and they just win
[6:30:02] <alphageek36> wtf
[6:30:02] <vortrx7> I hope other teams improve cuz this isnt fun lol
[6:30:03] <rrumack> GG

[6:30:08] <Cacemen> fl0m 2 of does 3 weren't for TL?
[6:30:09] <TheDraxxman> liquid took like 1/8 pistols against navi
[6:30:09] <evilvillain> its a reason they always drop the p250 to s1mple
[6:30:12] <gambinium> I think they lost to liquid while winning 5/6 pistols
[6:30:14] <mamluku> before they faced g2 they were 13-1
[6:30:16] <STatisfacti0n> @LucidR9 that and there was that stretch where it was like Astralis refused to play almost any events other than the major and blast KEKW

[6:36:37] <sunriseyolo> blade is a genius
[6:36:40] <Laufente27> %? fl0m to TL
[6:36:41] <Nightbot> Joris says 62%
[6:36:42] <Mangoyusi> the nitr0 move i feel is a bit of a question mark but im really not sure about shox coming to liquid, godlike clutch player but would he really fit in in a north american squad
[6:36:42] <yobtih> yobtih subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 33 months! made it home. Slept for 15 hours
[6:36:42] <Techno> - yobtih just re-subscribed for 33 months! fl0mPog
[6:36:42] <striegel_> Blade is the most straight faced human I've ever seen
[6:36:47] <BSODslayer> New rooster? Nice cock bro!
[6:36:47] <kooshyy> @fl0m  nitro osee naf elige rush mabye?
[6:36:49] <ap_craze> WHAT DID ADREN DO
[6:36:50] <logistic333> imagine if s1mple and zywoo are in the same team
[6:36:53] <BSODslayer> LUL
[6:36:55] <Pontih> @fl0m I think while the team on paper is not bad TL has way too much ego envolved in the team. And i don't think is only elige the problem but is a combination of stewie, elige, fallen + one new guy that has to learn.
[6:36:56] <BuSheeZy> @yobtih wooooooooo
[6:36:58] <gambinium> Have you talked to simple personally while he was in NA?
[6:36:59] <kingkwaku_> 14 is all they get let‚Äôs go

[6:37:06] <Kafkii> Everyone who says blade is chill needs to watch the vid of him screaming in comms
[6:37:07] <yznnck> @logistic333 that would make zero sense
[6:37:09] <Kafkii> Scary stuff
[6:37:10] <stormshitman> fl0m have you ever seen the markelof clip where s1mple maulds?
[6:37:11] <Sealer9> i wish liquid would grab rush instead of shox but rush is def going to eg with stew
[6:37:11] <diamonndcc> BROOO I WANNA SLEEP 15 HOURS TOO PLEASE
[6:37:14] <DIkktudo> @logistic333 or niko and zywoo
[6:37:15] <BooomerNinja> Nothing else to do today KEKW
[6:37:22] <getf1shy> @fl0m do you think RUSH is more likely to go to EG or Liquid?
[6:37:24] <BeauxGnar> Speaking of HellRaisers, they signed some T3 youngsters I wonder if they make it anywhere
[6:37:24] <logistic333> @yznnck why?
[6:37:25] <hmminator> @logistic333 they won't both are awpers

[6:38:06] <yznnck> @logistic333 their roles are too similar, both of their teams revolve around them completely.. like the whole system is based on giving them space, you cant put two players that take so much space in the same team
[6:38:06] <abp__> does stewie go to another team straight away or take a break
[6:38:08] <d0zerCS> fl0m do you queue with the hottest guys and buffest chads in FPL? PauseFish
[6:38:08] <Lockerific> Too bad s1mple can't win more than 3 majors, but you can't really l33t speak a 4 in his name so he'll have to stop at 3.

[6:50:29] <kooshyy> first 6 was gambit then last 6 navi
[6:50:29] <AidanS> smol era
[6:50:32] <akazplays> NA era 2022
[6:50:33] <MANIKcc> it's their year, an era would be more than 1
[6:50:33] <Jazprr> @baseplate93 omg Kimi kills me with that shit too LOL
[6:50:33] <sp0ons_> id say if they come back next year and win id say it starts a era
[6:50:35] <lo33y> eras are dumb
[6:50:36] <IcyCucumber420> slava ukraina
[6:50:37] <fluidfirexx> @fl0m this is more comparable to liquid's run
[6:50:38] <mrdicismv> @Speedrulez widepeepo smile
[6:50:38] <mrvosvos> era is cringe
[6:50:40] <mamluku> well in kennys words : online doesnt matter
[6:50:41] <logistic333> @BSODslayer bro i thought that confetti went on her too i dont know her name, her dress is shiny
[6:50:42] <ekstraLUV> astralis set the benchmark imo
[6:50:42] <Sungkarm> then by definition liquid jad no era
[6:50:42] <budahsak> they show no signs of slowing down so probably
[6:50:44] <AnnoyinMercenary> I think you can't call it an era till we go back to a full lan circuit @fl0m
[6:50:45] <SuperGhostGod> if they get another major that's an era
[6:50:46] <Cyan_die> KEKWait that would mean liquid didnt have an era
[6:50:47] <Sealer9> they won every big lan, the major, blast world finals
[6:50:47] <mdrdGaming> they won this event in the beginning of the year too
[6:50:50] <Speedrulez> mrdicismv smileW widepeepo
[6:50:50] <kooshyy> @fl0m people got to remember gambit was part of the jr group haha
[6:50:52] <TheLeviathong> Does that mean IGS Liquid wasn't an era? pepeHands
[6:50:53] <m4lki3r> But this wasn't a foregone conclusion. Gambit could have won this. The "Astralis Era" was anyone going Astralis was going to get DESTROYED.
[6:50:53] <Austyn_Gaming> more confetti
[6:50:54] <evilvillain> liquid is the only one who can stop them
[6:50:55] <megaganj> very dominant but era is dumb they had a good year
[6:50:57] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Sea of Thieves but fl0m is Bob Ross - https://youtu.be/sHYfvqWNgaE
[6:50:57] <Zorik13> @fl0m if year is an era then liquid didnt have one. i cant agree with that
[6:50:59] <Scornfulboot_eu> CIS era
[6:50:59] <fluidfirexx> @Cyan_die that is true tho
[6:51:03] <mrdicismv> @Speedrulez smileW peepowide smileW
[6:51:03] <mrvosvos> CIS era
[6:51:05] <BSODslayer> @logistic333 sorry, misunderstood FailFish
[6:51:05] <ShmetRT66> they gunna get confetti in the player keyboards bruh b
[6:51:06] <baseplate93> @Jazprr thats why he was my fav fl0mCry
[6:51:06] <alwayzpinchy> gambit was insane in the biggining
[6:51:07] <mrdicismv> FUCK
[6:51:09] <Speedrulez> fl0m you kinda look like widepeepo today M3
[6:51:10] <Speedrulez> <3
[6:51:11] <mamluku> liquid era : 63 days
[6:51:13] <Jazprr> Navi Era > Astralis Era
[6:51:15] <fluidfirexx> LIQUID DID NOT HAVE AN ERA SORRY NOT SORRY
[6:51:15] <mdrdGaming> I think Astralis changed the definition of ERA
[6:51:16] <sol1taire> imagine winning 500k playing a video game @Jazprr
[6:51:20] <DrIsaac> If theres one thing we learned from this tournament is that Navi can only lose to NA
[6:51:21] <Cyan_die> @Cyan_die Sadge my NA COPIUM
[6:51:24] <mrdicismv> @Speedrulez smileW widepeepo smileW
[6:51:28] <maurya_> id say if they keep winning into summer break its pretty legit
[6:51:32] <MANIKcc> maybe just don't call it an era :)
[6:51:34] <Speedrulez> mrdicismv peepoPat nice emotes bud
[6:51:35] <Mangoyusi> navi this year won 7 S tier tournaments including major and grand slam, Astralis won 8 in 2018 so there's an argument for an era here but most of navi's wins came later in the year while astralis' were spread out throughout the entire year
[6:51:36] <numb3r_cs> @fluidfirexx it's okey to have a false opinion
[6:51:39] <hmminator> yeah fair sk era was also a year

[6:53:16] <xBustNutZx> Not an era yet, top 10 teams haven't really been the strongest. Hopefully  with all the roster changes it'll improve and if Navi still dominate then it'll be an era.

[7:00:49] <lo33y> gambit seems to have the same problem as liquid
[7:00:55] <flames2802> gambit need lan confidence
[7:01:05] <yznnck> @diamonndcc b1t has no MVPs

[7:01:42] <diamonndcc> i know bro
[7:01:42] <Slasher> where does Navi stand winning the grand slam
[7:01:47] <BSODslayer> Ah, good point, hadn't thought about that aspect....
[7:01:49] <xBustNutZx> @yznnck I get your point, but take an honest look at the examples you've mentioned, they're all deeply flawed. NIP have a strong team but have a T side issue with hampus calling. Heroic
[7:01:52] <maurya_> i wish hobbit would adopt me
[7:01:52] <BSODslayer> Stonks, I guess LUL
[7:01:53] <DrIsaac> also 2021 was still mostly an Online era which cut costs for these tournaments right?

[7:02:46] <yznnck> @xBustNutZx yeah out of all these teams i would say heroic and gambit are the only ones that dont really have super obvious flaws

[7:02:58] <diamonndcc> hobbit is such a niceee person, all his interviews are very nice and respectfull
[7:03:06] <Slasher> Navi stealing all of Carmacs money, Navi going to bankrupt ESL
[7:03:07] <BSODslayer> Hobbit is so goddamn wholesome it's a wonder Banks hasn't fainted from it already. Jeez.

[7:03:13] <LowRatedHighlander> NOOO i missed the office queue
[7:03:14] <yznnck> @xBustNutZx like looking at gambit i dont think theres anything you could change about the roster to make them better, its just still not good enough to beat navi
[7:03:16] <LowRatedHighlander> Sadge
[7:03:40] <maurya_> @easternexamination when gambit is playing against a team im rooting for and he's still in the round im terrified

[7:04:18] <xBustNutZx> @yznnck @yznnck Heroic are good but also lacking something top bring them to the next level. G2 have great players and did good at the major but they aren't going to challenge Navi with the current roster.

[7:05:23] <striegel_> Fallen's tweet was nice
[7:05:27] <gg_leuke> its a good one, it google translates decently

[8:25:48] <Morde24> according to the wiki With Talent Legendary Craftsman.png Legendary Craftsman, ‚ú¶ Gemini Inscriptions may be etched onto a weapon that either is +5 or higher or already has 4 inscriptions. This means weapon drops as low as +3 can have a ‚ú¶ Gemini Inscriptions etched onto them, so long as they have 4 inscriptions, or as low as 1 inscription so long as it's upgraded to at least +5.
