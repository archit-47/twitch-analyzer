[1:56:10] <Silkjackel222> !scrim
[1:56:10] <masterbaiter_pt> i have the same question, i dont play anything besides MM
[1:56:10] <Nightbot> Silkjackel222, Scrims are usually played a full 30 rounds for practice reasons. so thats why the score is weird.
[1:56:12] <spli7er> KEKW
[1:56:15] <frogoree> WTF WHY ISNT THE GAME OVER
[1:56:17] <Silkjackel222> fl0mCozy
[1:56:18] <jayess3> mythic never loses
[1:56:20] <LucidR9> to put it simply
[1:56:21] <LucidR9> penis
[1:56:22] <spli7er> its a scrim
[1:56:28] <theBaboda> game no over? but 16-12?
[1:56:29] <absollutte> huh
[1:56:32] <spli7er> scrim is endless
[1:56:33] <bursttttttt> KEKWait

[1:56:38] <STatisfacti0n> !scrim
[1:56:38] <Nightbot> STatisfacti0n, Scrims are usually played a full 30 rounds for practice reasons. so thats why the score is weird.
[1:56:40] <headband_lucho> doccy's English just got progressively worse with each message in that
[1:56:42] <sevengaming_tv> doccy nailed it lmao
[1:56:43] <STatisfacti0n> scrim isn't endless, it's just a full 30
[1:56:48] <astrononymous> "it's not about winning or losing" LOOOOOL
[1:56:50] <frogoree> but fl0m that doesnt make sense, the game only goes to 16.
[1:56:50] <Solank0> Dont make fl0m turn this match around
[1:56:51] <coastalchan> Why game isn‚Äôt over
[1:56:52] <LucidR9> scrim never ends
[1:56:56] <LucidR9> its infinite
[1:56:56] <coastalchan> Game isn‚Äôt over?
[1:56:57] <coastalchan> 2)
[1:57:00] <nuke_cs> open teams always leave at 16 its extremely cringe
[1:57:00] <coastalchan> Y
[1:57:01] <LucidR9> if you start scrim you cannot leave
[1:57:04] <jayess3> you are contractually obligated to play 90 round in a scrim
[1:57:09] <frogoree> astrononymous its not tho?
[1:57:13] <petrosdev> no infinite game Sadge
[1:57:20] <SukksGaming> Its not about winning or losing, but the friends you made on your way -feeny (not realy)
[1:57:22] <masterbaiter_pt> imagine actually practising vertigo and not lurking with a shotgun
[1:57:35] <coastalchan> Name checks out ^
[1:57:43] <frogoree> the pwnalone special
[1:57:44] <headband_lucho> the answer is chat, flom cheats, thats why he seems good at the game, and he got a bonus cheat to never let mythic lose a game
[1:57:48] <R0bStar_Mafia> go B PepeLaugh
[1:58:06] <hcb_> @headband_lucho but they're losing right now monkaHmm

[2:36:16] <HighTyhd> @Puddin_Wing I like Studio engineering but nothing beats having all your equipment malfunction at the 5 minute call for a theatre/performing arts show KEKW
[2:36:19] <LuauLuau> like villa burnely and southampton
[2:36:24] <LucidR9> oh that aint it

[2:36:28] <SukksGaming> @LucidR9 You like that sandpie?
[2:36:31] <Puddin_Wing> I think it's a combination of having used computers for most of my life, and being classically trained in piano so my fingers are already pretty sure what they wanna do @angymilo
[2:36:33] <LuauLuau> we have no quality on the ball
[2:36:40] <dweevers> angymilo feeny is used to typewriters KEKW
[2:36:41] <LuauLuau> our only comfort is in the counter attack
[2:36:41] <VicarCS> Happy early birthday dad, have you gotten the milk yet? me and mom miss you @fl0m
[2:36:44] <LucidR9> saint max is quality on the ball
[2:36:48] <Puddin_Wing> You can fuck off @dweevers
[2:36:50] <LucidR9> just cannot finish to save his life
[2:36:56] <angymilo> @Puddin_Wing 0.0
[2:36:57] <LuauLuau> saint max is top 6 winger
[2:36:58] <Puddin_Wing> I'm used to wandering minstrels
[2:37:02] <angymilo> @dweevers KEKW
[2:37:03] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing pffft I'm older then you
[2:37:03] <cloutburstgg> @VicarCS lol
[2:37:09] <LucidR9> yeah I'll be honest I Have no clue why he's still at newcastle
[2:37:10] <theBaboda> @cloutburstgg that guy sounds absolutely cracked, i was nominated as one of the best jazz soloist in oklahoma at a highschool level. but damn almost knighted kinda crazy

[2:37:22] <LuauLuau> needs a club where his time on the ball isn't limited to 1v4 counter attacks
[2:37:23] <SukksGaming> Hearing mythic com like this makes me Pog irl
[2:37:23] <Puddin_Wing> You could be any age and I'd still think you're a twat @dweevers
[2:37:24] <Puddin_Wing> if that helps
[2:37:27] <Chezpuf> Le Monke
[2:37:29] <Puddin_Wing> idk why it would but hey
[2:37:37] <LucidR9> LuauLuau him and zaha both kinda throwing away their careers
[2:37:40] <dweevers> Puddin_Wing hey now at least I'm not a spurs fan
[2:37:46] <Puddin_Wing> that's fuckin true
[2:37:49] <angymilo> jojo sounds like he wants to jump off a cliff rn
[2:37:50] <LuauLuau> ASM still young not yet for him
[2:37:52] <Puddin_Wing> god imagine being a tottenham fan
[2:37:54] <LucidR9> tanganga is a fucking idiot
[2:37:55] <LuauLuau> zaha at palace is ???
[2:37:57] <Puddin_Wing> like how did you get to this poitn in life
[2:38:00] <SethDave> goodness that vessel
[2:38:02] <Puddin_Wing> and had noone telling you to make better decisions
[2:38:11] <LuauLuau> but then also they got edouard so that's exciting
[2:38:16] <LucidR9> tanganga getting sent off was one of the most 0 iq things i've seen
[2:38:17] <angymilo> ah that makes sense
[2:38:20] <LuauLuau> Palace > Arsenal this season imo
[2:38:21] <cloutburstgg> @theBaboda yeah like there are certain "levels" or somethings that u need to pass (they're like exams?) and he went up till the second last one but didnt get time to prep for the last one and just let it go. he stopped playing instruments sadly cuz of some personal stuff but i've heard some of his old stuff and its really cool
[2:38:23] <LucidR9> LuauLuau conor gallagher has been playing very well
[2:38:23] <k1ing_scrr> !age
[2:38:24] <Nightbot> 28 (sooooo old yes)
[2:38:29] <Puddin_Wing> I mean, that's a low fuckin bar @LuauLuau
[2:38:40] <Puddin_Wing> As long as Arteta is in charge we're gonna stay shite
[2:38:45] <Puddin_Wing> the issue isnt our squad at this point
[2:38:57] <LucidR9> oh have the arsenal collective moved back to blaming their manager again
[2:38:59] <LuauLuau> I mean the squad is bad and overpayed as well
