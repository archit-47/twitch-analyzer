[1:07:08] <LowRatedHighlander> fl0m if you take that to the hell stage in stage 4 and use it on the broken down rex. it unlocks the character. but if you fall below half hp it explodes

[1:58:18] <LowRatedHighlander> good nightbot
[1:58:46] <starbasegoblins> why are they bouncing the stage so fast?
[1:58:47] <crocswsocks> you has
[1:58:53] <LowRatedHighlander> faster the better
[1:59:04] <LowRatedHighlander> especially since they did acrids land
[1:59:06] <heinrichbarton> That shirt is fire @fl0m
[1:59:09] <Doccy> faster = easier kinda
[1:59:16] <starbasegoblins> they are at nearly 3.5 min a stage, they are good
[1:59:26] <whitechocolate64> any HOTDOGGERS in chat?
[1:59:30] <LowRatedHighlander> your stage time should be about max 4:30
[1:59:31] <starbasegoblins> stay below 6-8 minutes a stage and you should be safe
[1:59:39] <LowRatedHighlander> like thats the goal you should set
[1:59:43] <justchelsea2010> justho15Hi flom and chat
[1:59:52] <LowRatedHighlander> and then of course theres exceptions
[2:00:03] <LowRatedHighlander> justchelsea2010 justho15Hi how you doin!@
[2:00:08] <starbasegoblins> Hidden realms don't increase difficulty though
[2:00:09] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKW
[2:00:16] <BrotherJon> did everyone lose
[2:00:17] <BrotherJon> KEKW
[2:00:17] <Doccy> NEW GAMBA
[2:00:18] <justchelsea2010> I'm great, how are you?
[2:00:19] <ElaD_O> since they did void fields, they can smash through stages 2 and 3 and which makes stage 4 boss easier where you do want to farm @starbasegoblins
[2:00:22] <Doccy> everyone lost
[2:00:26] <Solank0> Check the crates below
[2:00:27] <Doccy> kinda omegalul
[2:00:30] <BrotherJon> chat all doubters
[2:00:35] <ElaD_O> blinking red lights
[2:00:37] <LowRatedHighlander> starbasegoblins youre right but what im saying is they get a power spike for all the extra items. so they can sprint through the next couple stages to stay ahead of the difficulty

[2:01:00] <MrAwkwardTurtle> point and shoot
[2:01:02] <mitchu101> always the accumulator
[2:01:09] <DavieWhy> Huge odds for nays
[2:01:09] <mitchu101> its cracked tho
[2:01:10] <ElaD_O> you don't have to stay still, just keep pointing it at the boss
[2:01:21] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah dont have to stay still
[2:01:25] <LowRatedHighlander> it just has a wind up
[2:01:35] <LowRatedHighlander> so keep aiming where you want it until it shoots
[2:01:53] <starbasegoblins> I feel like 6 minutes is usually the better balance between items/time. Because if you progress through stages too quickly you are missing items and increasing the stage difficulty multiplier
[2:02:07] <ElaD_O> with magma. worm you can aim at the floor where you think they would go and they would still take damage
[2:02:13] <starbasegoblins> I hate magma worms, they are just annoying to hit
[2:02:15] <BrotherJon> EZ Clap
[2:02:18] <LowRatedHighlander> in monsoon you need to have the time at around 4:30
[2:02:26] <BrotherJon> YEP Balls
[2:02:27] <LowRatedHighlander> it makes a considerable difference in difficulty
[2:02:34] <Doccy> chat, magma balls! ha got ya
[2:02:46] <LowRatedHighlander> but of course theres always exceptions like if you find a crit printer or something
[2:03:16] <StormbornVal> @Doccy 😞
[2:03:19] <Not_Grahm> Sup homie
[2:03:20] <starbasegoblins> yeah I always play in monsoon, but then again I guess I'm a bit more comfortable with the game and lurking around till 6 min.

[2:09:45] <gummer441> gotta look for the pink shrooms
[2:10:24] <gummer441> @starbasegoblins there's one more near the back tree one almost underground too, and maybe one more i cant remember

[2:13:53] <LowRatedHighlander> dont hit gold shrine on this stage bedcause you cant go there and mythrix
[2:13:55] <Doccy> you can after this
[2:13:59] <crocswsocks> you cant beat the game if you hit gold portal
[2:14:03] <gummer441> not for beating the game, it sends you to another realm
[2:14:05] <LowRatedHighlander> if you take the gold shrine portal on this stage you have to loop fl0m
[2:14:07] <datkidaa> HYPERGAMBLE
[2:14:18] <crocswsocks> no
[2:14:19] <starbasegoblins> do 2nd loop mithrix, so much better 80% of the time

[2:14:21] <ByJordz> does fl0m winky big?
[2:14:21] <LowRatedHighlander> its better not to loop fl0m
[2:14:23] <Doccy> ratJAM a bop has been heard
[2:14:28] <Solank0> Sometime it is
[2:14:29] <starbasegoblins> YES
[2:14:32] <LowRatedHighlander> its always easier to kill mythrix first loop
[2:14:43] <LowRatedHighlander> especially with how far ahead you are
[2:14:49] <crocswsocks> its almost never better to loop if you want to kill mythrix
[2:14:51] <LowRatedHighlander> because you potentially lose your lead if you loop
[2:14:55] <Solank0> Personally i loop like 6 or 7 times
[2:14:56] <starbasegoblins> nah, killing mithrix is so much better at loop 2 specifically
[2:15:03] <LowRatedHighlander> you are wrong
[2:15:05] <LowRatedHighlander> im sorry
[2:15:08] <crocswsocks> ^
[2:15:10] <LowRatedHighlander> but just very wrong
[2:15:15] <praeter15> loop 2 might be the worst time to fight mithrix
[2:15:19] <Nightbot> Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
[2:15:25] <ElaD_O> looping on monsoon really depends on how fast you are and how good your items are. I only go mitrix first loop if I have insane items from void field
[2:15:29] <LowRatedHighlander> as someone who has done multiple eclipse runs and watched others do them way better
[2:15:36] <LowRatedHighlander> first loop is the best time to kill mythrix
[2:15:42] <praeter15> loop 2 is such an awkward point in the run fighting mithrix is cringe
[2:15:54] <datkidaa> HOTDOGGERS
[2:15:54] <Nightbot> Welcome! To the Nathans Famous Duo Stream where myself (fl0m) and JoshOG play video games and eat delicious Nathans Famous hot dogs once a week for a sponsored stream! Use the link below to find Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs at a store near you! bit.ly/GlizzyFl0m
[2:15:59] <starbasegoblins> Loop 2 allows for much more fleshed builds that can just smash mithrix, frequently at the end of loop 1 a build is only barely coming into view
[2:16:19] <LowRatedHighlander> yes but youre missing the part where mythrix is easier to kill
[2:16:24] <ByJordz> As someone who's main goal isn't even to kill mithrix, just go 9-10 loops to the point where you can't move without running off the planet
[2:16:35] <crocswsocks> if you are making good pace mythrix will have lower hp, if you are too slow you have pretty much no chance of surviving a loop
[2:16:37] <ElaD_O> yeah I'd you're smart on loop 2 you can have a way stronger build
[2:16:46] <starbasegoblins> yes but at loop 2 you are also much stronger, I understand he technically has less health, but you have less items
[2:16:48] <kr_azy> flom!!
[2:16:58] <BrotherJon> peepoSprint
[2:17:10] <crocswsocks> starbasegoblins its okay to be wrong :)
[2:17:14] <praeter15> the less items are made up by the fact that mithrix has less HP peepoSit
[2:17:47] <DavieWhy> wow fl0m is really good at running away
[2:17:50] <sleeeeppyyyy> !1deag
[2:17:50] <crocswsocks> OMEGALUL
[2:17:51] <Nightbot> sleeeeppyyyy pops a 1deag on cornfedbanana 1TAP
[2:17:51] <BrotherJon> KEKPOINT
[2:17:52] <sleeeeppyyyy> %? 53
[2:17:52] <Nightbot> Joris says 87%
[2:17:57] <LowRatedHighlander> like even woolie who plays this shit way more than any of us combined says you should always fight mythrix loop 1
[2:18:01] <praeter15> DavieWhy thats why hes an awper peepoSit
[2:18:04] <sleeeeppyyyy> praeter15
[2:18:10] <starbasegoblins> having more items can be a complete force multiplier, just Mithrix having less health doesn't make him any easier
[2:18:11] <praeter15> sleeeeppyyyy go to bed
[2:18:19] <sleeeeppyyyy> praeter15 about to KEKW
[2:18:23] <praeter15> good
[2:18:29] <LowRatedHighlander> mythrix having less health makes more builds able to beat him
[2:18:30] <DavieWhy> @praeter15 peepoFoil or he practiced with the government first
[2:18:32] <sleeeeppyyyy> praeter15 jk KEKPOINT
[2:18:32] <praeter15> strange individual you are sleeeeppyyyy
[2:18:38] <LowRatedHighlander> you dont need a perfect build to beat a weakened mythrix
[2:18:42] <sleeeeppyyyy> okay praeter15 paapoWeird
[2:18:47] <LowRatedHighlander> which is why its better
[2:18:48] <starbasegoblins> at loop 1 you don't even have a build you have a loose conglomeration of items
[2:18:57] <praeter15> mithrix scales pretty well with run time also
[2:19:04] <praeter15> so its never really easier tbh
[2:19:33] <ElaD_O> the way I see it ideally, you wanna get to mithrix when you have enough movement speed that getting hit isn't a problem and you have a set of items that allows you to destroy him @crocswsocks I usually do loop 3-4 mithrix if I'm not aiming for the scavenger boss
[2:19:44] <LowRatedHighlander> monkaW
[2:19:49] <BrotherJon> not even close
[2:19:50] <DavieWhy> monkaW
[2:19:51] <BrotherJon> Kappa
[2:19:52] <ByJordz> To be honest at this point you may as well stick a screwdriver down your urethra and smack your cock between two bricks and a wall before fighting mithrix

[2:20:53] <crocswsocks> I mean in the end when it comes down to it, its a game and you can play however you want. but beating mythrix on stage 6 is absolutely 100% going to be the best way to get consistent mythrix kills

[2:22:28] <LowRatedHighlander> thats one that he has only further reinforced
[2:22:33] <crocswsocks> indubitably
[2:22:42] <macbookfps> welp
[2:22:44] <macbookfps> rip odds
[2:22:54] <praeter15> i wonder if theyll add rewards to eclipse next update fl0mHmm
[2:23:04] <DavieWhy> WTFF odds? wtf happened
[2:23:08] <starbasegoblins> Anyone who thinks Mithrix suddenly transforms into an untouchable past loop 1 really needs to just mess around in the game more and feel out the various corners of it
[2:23:20] <ElaD_O> rewards for eclipse would be nice
[2:23:21] <LowRatedHighlander> like at one point he was trying to do eclipse runs on second loop and just flat stopped because he just kept proving that it was a bad idea even if his build by stage 6 was bad
[2:23:28] <Nightbot> NEW VIDEO OUT ON 2nd CHANNEL GO WATCH: Weirdest Santa Mod in Red Dead Online - https://youtu.be/6RNFJEHXWpM
[2:23:44] <starbasegoblins> you can get insanely powerful by crafting builds and synergizing items
[2:23:58] <ElaD_O> I would love a 3rd character skin for beating mithrix on eclipse 8 @praeter15
[2:24:00] <LowRatedHighlander> and his wording because of that was basically you have a better chance of beating mythrix after an hour of fighting with a shit build then trying to make it through second loop and hoping you get the better items to fight a stronger mythrix
[2:24:06] <ByJordz> no cap
[2:24:10] <praeter15> ElaD_O or literally just anything for eclipse Peepo
[2:24:15] <crocswsocks> starbasegoblins its just about consistency. fl0m and josh arent to the point yet where they understand the synergies and probably cant make it though a loop

[2:24:23] <LowRatedHighlander> that also
[2:24:24] <praeter15> give me a little hat for my character when i beat an eclipse for the first time
[2:24:32] <starbasegoblins> if you are talking about MAYO runs then obviously fighting mithrix asap as a very experienced player is better. But then again you are fighting Mithrix with minimal room for error.
[2:24:33] <praeter15> change the color for every level of eclipse i beat
[2:24:39] <LowRatedHighlander> crocswsocks also brings up a really important point. these guys never loop
[2:24:47] <LowRatedHighlander> theyll get clapped by the first malachite they run into
[2:24:49] <praeter15> idk if they know how to loop
[2:24:59] <buskaboiger> fawdzKiss fawdzKiss
[2:25:18] <starbasegoblins> if they can start doing loops then they'd be able to get more experience for how this game evolves and changes
[2:25:21] <Nightbot> Follow the link to join fl0m's discord and come hang out with his ever growing community https://discord.gg/fl0m | Make sure to link your twitch to discord if you're a sub!
[2:25:27] <LowRatedHighlander> its even in his guide on how to beat mythrix
[2:25:51] <bruhandon46> Flom be drippin in that shirt
[2:25:53] <crocswsocks> starbasegoblins they've made it to stage 6 like twice lol
[2:25:54] <LowRatedHighlander> like yeah he strats change a bit as he goes on. but thats one ive only seen him push more and more the longer hes played lol
[2:26:10] <starbasegoblins> honestly, I wanna see him and woolie do a stream together, I feel like they would vibe pretty hard
[2:26:12] <ByJordz> I feel like if you never loop you're not playing properly
[2:26:18] <Nightbot> Latest video: What the Voice Comms during a DreamHack CS:GO Tournament Sounds Like! - https://youtu.be/OSlVtFo9bcw
[2:26:22] <ByJordz> Make it as hard as possible without cumming basically
[2:26:23] <starbasegoblins> @crocswsocks we all start somewhere
[2:26:24] <LowRatedHighlander> im curious on how that would go KEKW
[2:26:26] <praeter15> ByJordz i wouldnt go that far
[2:26:45] <praeter15> especially for new players not looping is probably better
[2:26:58] <ElaD_O> they can spawn both on the same side
[2:26:59] <ByJordz> Its gotta be back in the other part then KEKW
[2:27:16] <Solank0> They are set spawns but not always on each side
[2:27:18] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah i wouldnt go that far ether. play it how you want to. if you like fighting mythrix then do that if you like looping then do that
[2:27:24] <starbasegoblins> someone should help him get the command artifact, allow him to mess around with items
[2:27:27] <LowRatedHighlander> its all on what makes you happy
[2:27:40] <praeter15> remember when they got overloading worm on stage 5 peepoSit
[2:27:47] <LowRatedHighlander> KEKW
[2:27:52] <LowRatedHighlander> that shit was hilarious
[2:27:52] <starbasegoblins> regardless of what everyone is saying I think we can all agree there is no right or wrong way to play the game
[2:27:54] <praeter15> honestly kinda impressive
[2:27:57] <ByJordz> Nothing makes me happier than watching fl0m fail peepoSit
[2:28:03] <LowRatedHighlander> youre absolutely right
[2:28:15] <praeter15> i kinda hope they add something harder than monsoon
[2:28:19] <WookiePotamus> peepoSit
[2:28:24] <starbasegoblins> @praeter15 eclipse
[2:28:29] <LowRatedHighlander> its just what crocswsocks said eariler. there is no perfect way to play the game that will work 100 percent of the time. there are more consistent ways to play it
[2:28:46] <praeter15> eclipse is insanely hard for the sake of being hard so its not really fun
[2:28:50] <p3ppy3> fl0mCode fl0mCult fl0mCode fl0mC fl0mFlock fl0mMythic
[2:28:53] <crocswsocks> BoolinJAM
[2:28:54] <starbasegoblins> thats fair, I guess I find myself just more comfortable on loop2 runs
[2:28:54] <ByJordz> ACTUALLY there is a 100% guaranteed way to play this game and you guys aren't having sex if you aren't using my playstyle Peepo
[2:29:08] <LowRatedHighlander> that will get you more consistent results but there will always be exceptions and things that happen. how you deal with those exceptions is what divides the skill of the player base
[2:29:10] <starbasegoblins> this man sexs
[2:29:18] <praeter15> ByJordz im not having sex because im a ror2 encyclopedia Peepo
[2:29:21] <ByJordz> I mean, none of you are having sex anyway cause you're fl0m viewers but still
[2:29:34] <starbasegoblins> true
[2:30:03] <LowRatedHighlander> a new difficulty would be interesting
[2:30:07] <WookiePotamus> !1deag
[2:30:08] <Nightbot> WookiePotamus pops a 1deag on literallyaunicorn 1TAP
[2:30:08] <LowRatedHighlander> but idk if they would do it
[2:30:10] <crocswsocks> Pog
[2:30:25] <starbasegoblins> I think in the woolie interview they said they weren't going to
[2:30:31] <crocswsocks> next update is supposed to be paid dlc right?
[2:30:34] <LowRatedHighlander> it would make sense if they didnt
[2:30:36] <praeter15> crocswsocks ye
[2:30:38] <LowRatedHighlander> yeah paid
[2:30:40] <starbasegoblins> correct crocs
[2:30:43] <praeter15> by februaryish next year
[2:30:51] <WookiePotamus> @praeter15
[2:30:52] <Doccy> tbh game devs need to, instead of adding hard difficulties, add easier ones
[2:30:59] <starbasegoblins> I think they confirmed it would be themed for the Imps and those types

[2:31:26] <WookiePotamus> make a difficulty called drought
[2:31:33] <WookiePotamus> that's what I would play on
[2:31:33] <ByJordz> They need like "old man urinates in his diaper" diffictuly
[2:31:36] <LowRatedHighlander> chat? not griefing? WTFF
[2:31:37] <ByJordz> Like lower than drizzle
[2:31:41] <praeter15> an eclipse mode where you can customize what debuffs you get would be neat
[2:31:42] <Doccy> mist difficulty
[2:31:45] <starbasegoblins> I'm really hyped for the DLCs to come because they emphasized that it would include MULTIPLE survivors
[2:31:49] <crocswsocks> WookiePotamus peaceful mode
[2:31:56] <Silkjackel222> We never grief Peepo
[2:31:58] <LowRatedHighlander> praeter15 what if they added that after you complete eclipse 8?
[2:32:01] <LowRatedHighlander> that would be cool
[2:32:06] <ElaD_O> 12 minutes stage 3 is worth it for bands imo
[2:32:11] <praeter15> MAAO Eclipse 8
[2:32:23] <praeter15> 4 player difficulty

[3:03:38] <Nightbot> hello fellow chatters i think im pretty hip with the kids so let me try to give my opinion. I am going to keep it one hundred as well as a dollar fifty with you this game looks exceedingly "busting" i believe that the graphics are no cap very exquisite on gosh some would say "sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh" to how stellar this gameplay looks
[3:03:56] <crocswsocks> fl0m is assembled differently
[3:03:57] <praeter15> its the dog dick pillar
[3:03:59] <ByJordz> True, he is built like a kitchen appliance that hasn't been plugged in for months
