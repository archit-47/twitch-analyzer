[0:44:12] <ImTarco> Maybe because you haven't been grinding it to shit so it's just mega chilled out.

[1:00:17] <Sun__House> fl0m, find yourself a nice tailor, get fitted.  promise, it's like... an experience to wear clothes specifically made for your body.  like eating good food, only for your sense of touch instead of taste

[1:00:21] <fr0stbb> I have a adidas pair thats like 35 euro and they are super comfy

[5:53:22] <ForeverRed_> nice swing
[5:53:24] <SuperTuscan888> Yeah my free time consists of maybe 2 hours a week
[5:53:45] <KodaRG> but yeah ninja at one point had the most concurrent subs at one point taking away the sub-at-thon and then right behind him critical role at 140k
[5:53:49] <sleeeeppyyyy> SuperTuscan888 finally some more free time? D:
[5:53:53] <LowRatedHighlander> it’s ok we’ll be here whenever you have time @supertuscan888 peepoHuggers

[5:54:06] <SuperTuscan888> There's too many, that's the issue
[5:54:08] <KodaRG> XQC holds the most at 84k right now
[5:54:15] <yourducky> You have to also think about when he was in OWL and scrimmed 8-10 hours then went and streamed after all that KEKW

[5:55:40] <KodaRG> I think the biggest difference with XQC and alot of other people is one of few that can play or do anything and still be over 50k people watching
[5:55:51] <yourducky> summit is a fucking mad man
[5:55:59] <graphslol> these dudes are so committed its crazy
[5:56:03] <Lowgunk> 13 yo talent back at it
[5:56:08] <KodaRG> thats ture
[5:56:09] <plozi89> Summit is an icon
[5:56:09] <yourducky> "Alright guys day off" "NVM WE STREAM TODAY"
[5:56:09] <KodaRG> true
[5:56:11] <Thermophobe> summit got me gaming
[5:56:15] <billballbowl> I feel like xqc is just what he would be doing off stream anyways, and that's part of the appeal
[5:56:19] <Thermophobe> sumLove
[5:56:26] <jokkerbo> and he still feels guilty if he doesn't stream @fl0m like bro it's cool, take some time
[5:56:31] <yourducky> tatW Sadge
[5:56:33] <namrus69> One of the reasons Ludwig left was so he didnt have to stream less
[5:56:34] <KodaRG> NODDERS
[5:56:37] <oTTV_BTW> wheres tim now
[5:56:40] <Mdiver_> @SuperTuscan888 dude its nuts. prices are high, quality low. we're about to have our biggest sale of the year and i just looked around our lot... either immaculate condition, or rusted out bucket. im in the midwest
[5:56:43] <KodaRG> theres a handful of them which is always awesome to see
[5:56:45] <xReef> I feel like at around 4-5am EST when all the big streams have dipped in viewers xQc still being at 60K is crazy
[5:56:47] <yourducky> can we get an F for tatW chat
[5:56:47] <zoofuu_> Fl0m stop streaming so I can be productive
[5:56:51] <sleeeeppyyyy> fl0m if you act dumb, you will actually get more viewers. #FACT
