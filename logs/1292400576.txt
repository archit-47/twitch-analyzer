[2:32:25] <n0r13k> Sorry Mr Flom, but you can't just accuse people of cheating. First of all, it's impossible to cheat on VAC secured servers. Moreoever, why would you join a service like FACEIT (whose primary purpose is to provide the best competitive service and allow people to grind the game to get better) to just stream snipe? It just doesn't make sense.
