[0:12:01] <lololosher1> potential account and billing information could be leaked
[0:12:01] <dbz1h> yea subie rolls that way i picked up my '13 the day after christmas 2012
[0:12:06] <Doccy> fl0m's opinion is the twitch leak is fake
[0:12:08] <lololosher1> easy dox
[0:12:15] <Doccy> as it doesn't put him in the top 100
[0:12:17] <sealer9> majority of those people have their subs publicly listed on their stream lol
[0:12:19] <Doccy> which i mean
[0:12:20] <Doccy> he is
[0:12:21] <siiiif> Doccy youre fake peepoFoil
[0:12:29] <Doccy> i was never teal chat

[0:12:35] <thykknir> why dont you play old school runescape?
[0:12:41] <Doccy> i'm purple and i am fake
[0:12:42] <StormbornVal> Is it before or after taxes tho?
[0:12:44] <WookiePotamus> morning Doccy
[0:12:51] <HerrRhodes> if you didnt know that streamers made money what are you doing?
[0:12:52] <heenan_09> fl0mC
[0:12:53] <damecs> math hard
[0:12:54] <focns> it was just cool info Smile :)
[0:13:02] <lololosher1> funny thing is that it probably excludes sponsor deals
[0:13:09] <rainbowjelly> would you play competitive match in bf2042 if some creative players create gamemode in Portal?
[0:13:09] <johnny_legless> johnny_legless subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! top 100 can suck my NiceCock
[0:13:09] <Techno> - johnny_legless just re-subscribed for 3 months! fl0mPog
[0:13:11] <Kafkii> Im surprised people think streamers dont make money
[0:13:18] <siiiif> the government is coming peepoW
[0:13:18] <Underr_> networth site says youre 23 fl0mW
[0:13:31] <Uwotm08> Did they leak the complete chat history too? That sounds like a lot of data for Twitch to keep around.
[0:13:35] <WookiePotamus> dammit now people know my name is Max thrustcock fl0mT
[0:13:35] <Doccy> it excludes sponsor deals, donations, and anything that isn't a twitch payment
[0:13:42] <Kafkii> @fl0m if you play PORTALS, there is competitive
[0:13:43] <dweevers> fl0m looks like it was a grey hat so it doesn't look like personal information is out there YET. hopefully it stays grey hat hacking and not black hat hacking
[0:13:48] <Doccy> as twitch can't track that stuff
[0:13:50] <dbz1h> did they leak peoples like home address' or anything, that certainly seems like it would open up law suits
[0:13:51] <heenan_09> fl0mHmm fl0mHmm fl0mHmm
[0:14:01] <random_guy3> it was weird to find out that I don't even know most of the channels on that list
[0:14:06] <johnny_legless> @WookiePotamus fair play, my real name is Heywood Jablome
[0:14:08] <Kafkii> Nope
[0:14:09] <5Rule_> rbzDuckA

[0:14:18] <BabyLaine> the battlefield beta?
[0:14:21] <lololosher1> every twitch streamer evades them, what are you on about PixelBob
[0:14:26] <twilc04> can u play pilot in the beta?

[0:57:03] <sl0wchair> as long as its not like cod where you get double the fps in beta apposed to the full game
[0:57:10] <Dhagan74> My 1060 can’t handle it. It’s unplayable for me.
[0:57:10] <spaceripple> on low
[0:57:25] <Dhagan74> I’m on low.
[0:58:00] <RockSkar> I would hope a 3080 would push 100+ frames at 1440p
[0:58:07] <spaceripple> its an old build, and there isnt a driver so full release should be better so ive been told
[0:58:29] <poggus_champpus> @Dhagan74 do you have 6gb 1060 or 3gb?
[0:58:44] <AHsam23> that headshot looked satisfying

[1:02:16] <RockSkar> maybe hybrid sight is hold zoom and hit shift or v or b?
[1:02:19] <s7nthetik> @angymilo and you dont?
[1:02:34] <astrononymous> battlefield and cod are finally similar enough that i really can't tell the difference anymore
[1:02:47] <GFYMeowMix> is a 1080ti sufficient for this game? i have a feeling my comp on low would still struggle
[1:02:49] <buttmud> I was watching ImMarksman earlier. He had to remove the hybrid scope and re-equip it for it to start working again. Think he said it was 'F' for the keybind
