[2:58:35] <susanooo__> yea they are
[2:58:36] <Hevar> yeah both teams agreed
[2:58:36] <whoinvitedjez> @Hevar helt sjukt
[2:58:44] <Mikkel1591> yes they are playing because they know he is okay
[2:58:50] <whoinvitedjez> still
[2:58:56] <susanooo__> denmark have extra motivation now to try go further in euros
[2:59:06] <Hevar> men realistiskt sett
[2:59:11] <Hevar> hur skulle de skjuta p√• matchen
[2:59:14] <Hevar> med ett s√• tight schema
[2:59:15] <susanooo__> his father said he is "ok"
[2:59:20] <Hevar> tror uefa pressade och sa ni m√•ste spela
[2:59:23] <whoinvitedjez> finns ett par dagar som dem inte spelar p√• √§nd√•
[2:59:26] <whoinvitedjez> ja typ
[2:59:27] <Mikkel1591> i was like no way they are playing it
[2:59:29] <whoinvitedjez> hade inte f√∂rv√•nat mig
[2:59:30] <susanooo__> Hevar do u think he will retire from football ?
[2:59:40] <Hevar> it depends if its a heart condition
[2:59:41] <Mikkel1591> but i guess they have to because of the schedule
[2:59:42] <Hevar> if it is, then yes
[2:59:53] <susanooo__> fodasse
[3:00:04] <susanooo__> i think he will dribble this and comeback stronger!
[3:00:05] <Loyalcss> na moly
[3:00:14] <whoinvitedjez> most likely retiring
[3:00:14] <Hevar> hopefully
[3:00:16] <Hevar> top baller
[3:00:17] <whoinvitedjez> it would be the sensible thing
[3:00:21] <Hevar> but if it risks his health
[3:00:27] <Hevar> it would be horribly stupid to keep playing
[3:00:34] <susanooo__> Hevar i trusted on him to my euro team
[3:00:37] <susanooo__> and now this FeelsBadMan
[3:01:15] <dotalegendery2> we love ot
[3:02:05] <MenaceAKA> i would think that eriksen would be the kind of player who would want to keep on playing against his better judgement
[3:02:21] <MenaceAKA> hopefully the medical staff can get it to him that its not worth it
[3:02:21] <libradinho> they cant reschedule the program is so tight , they would have to settle for 1 points each if not
[3:02:41] <MenaceAKA> hes already made a lot of money as is and people will love him regardless of what happens
[3:03:22] <Hevar> considering he has a wife and kids i hope he just says yes to retiring MenaceAKA
